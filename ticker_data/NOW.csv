MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes appearing at the end of this filing. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this filing, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. You should read the “Risk Factors” section of this filing for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results and the timing of certain events to differ materially from future results expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis. Overview ServiceNow is a leading provider of cloud-based services to automate enterprise IT operations. We focus on transforming enterprise IT by automating and standardizing business processes and consolidating IT across the global enterprise. Organizations deploy our service to create a single system of record for enterprise IT, lower operational costs and enhance efficiency. Additionally, our customers use our extensible platform to build custom applications for automating activities unique to their business requirements. We offer our service under a SaaS business model. Our subscription fee includes access to our suite of on-demand applications, access to our platform to build custom applications, and our technical support and management of our cloud-based infrastructure. We provide a scaled pricing model based on the duration of the subscription term and we frequently extend discounts to our customers based on the number of users. We generally bill our customers annually in advance. We generate sales through our direct sales team and indirectly through channel partners and third-party referrals. We also generate revenues from professional services for implementation and training of customer personnel. Many customers initially subscribe to our service to solve a specific and immediate problem. Once their problem is solved, many of our customers deploy additional applications as they become more familiar with our service and apply it to new IT processes. In addition, some customers adopt our platform to build applications that automate various processes for business uses outside of IT such as human resources, facilities and quality control management. A majority of our revenues come from large global enterprise customers. Our total customers grew 55% to 1,512 as of December 31, 2012 from 974 as of December 31, 2011. We were founded in 2004 and entered into our first commercial contract in 2005. To date, we have funded our business primarily with cash flows from operations. We raised net proceeds of $173.3 million in our June 2012 initial public offering after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and before deducting expenses in connection with the offering of $3.5 million. In November 2012, we raised an additional $51.0 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and before deducting expenses in connection with the offering of $1.2 million. We continue to invest in the development of our service, infrastructure and sales and marketing to drive long-term growth. We increased our overall employee headcount to 1,077 as of December 31, 2012 from 603 as of December 31, 2011. Fiscal Year End On February 3, 2012, our board of directors approved a change to our fiscal year-end from June 30 to December 31. Included in this filing is the transition period for the six months ended December 31, 2011. References to “fiscal 2011” and “fiscal 2010” still refer to the fiscal years ended June 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Key Factors Affecting Our Performance Total customers. We believe total customers is a key indicator of our market penetration, growth and future revenues. We have aggressively invested in and intend to continue to invest in our direct sales force, as well as the pursuit of additional partnerships within our indirect sales channel. We generally define a customer as an entity with an active service contract as of the measurement date. In situations where there is a single contract that applies to entities with multiple subsidiaries or divisions, universities, or governmental organizations, each entity that has contracted for a separate production instance of our service is counted as a separate customer. Our total customers were 1,512 and 974 as of December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011, respectively. Investment in growth. We have aggressively invested, and intend to continue to invest, in expanding our operations, increasing our headcount and developing technology to support our growth. We expect our total operating expenses to increase in the foreseeable future, particularly as we continue to expand our sales and marketing organizations, further invest in research and development and grow our cloud-based infrastructure to support our growth. We continue to invest in our sales and marketing organization to drive additional revenues and support the growth of our customer base. Any investments we make in our sales and marketing organization and our capacity to deliver our services will occur in advance of experiencing any benefits from such investments, so it may be difficult for us to determine if we are efficiently allocating our resources in these areas.26 Renewal rate. We calculate our renewal rate by subtracting our attrition rate from 100%. Our attrition rate for a period is equal to the annual contract value from customers that are due for renewal in the period and did not renew, divided by the total annual contract value from all customers due for renewal during the period. Annual contract value is equal to the first twelve months of expected subscription revenues under a contract. We believe our renewal rate is an important metric to measure the long-term value of customer agreements and our ability to retain our customers. Our renewal rate was 97% for each of the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, 97% and 99% for the six months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and 97% and 95% for fiscal 2011 and 2010, respectively. Upsells. In order for us to continue to grow our business, it is important to generate additional revenue from existing customers. We believe there is significant opportunity to increase the number of subscriptions sold to current customers as customers become more familiar with our platform, adopt our applications to address additional business use cases and expand the use of the platform throughout their enterprise. Our increase in subscriptions is driven by the increased number of users accessing our suite of on-demand applications, as well as our other enabling technologies, Discovery and Orchestration, that are separately priced on a per server basis. We believe our ability to upsell is a key factor affecting our ability to further penetrate our existing customer base. We monitor upsells by measuring the annual contract value of upsells signed in the period as a percentage of our total annual contract value of all contracts signed in the period. Upsells as a percentage of total annual contract value signed was 30% and 29% for the year ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, 28% and 25% for the six months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, and 27% and 25% for fiscal 2011 and 2010, respectively. Investment in infrastructure. We have made and will continue to make investments in new equipment to support growth and enhancements at our data centers and expand our office facilities around the world. During the fourth quarter of 2012, we completed our transition from a managed service hosting model to a co-location model and invested in enhancements to our cloud architecture in our co-location data centers. We recorded additional expense during the year ended December 31, 2012 related to the transition from our managed service data centers to our co-location infrastructure investments. During 2013, we will continue to invest in enhancements to our cloud architecture, which are designed to provide our customers with enhanced scalability, data reliability and availability, including the purchase of additional networking infrastructure. We are also evaluating the expansion of our data center locations to address additional geographic markets, which will result in additional investments to our infrastructure if pursued. In addition, we will continue to enter into new office facility leases in the future to accommodate our projected headcount growth at various locations around the world. These new leases may require investments in leasehold improvements, as well as furniture and equipment to support our employees. If we add to our headcount at a faster rate than anticipated, we may incur substantial costs in terminating leases to enter into new leases for larger space. Professional services model. We believe our investment in professional services facilitates the adoption of our subscription service. Prior to 2012, our pricing for professional services was predominantly on a fixed-fee basis and the cost of the time and materials incurred to complete these services was often greater than the amount charged to the customer. Beginning in December 2011, we began shifting our pricing model to a time-and-materials basis and increased our focus on scoping projects and managing resource utilization. As a result of these changes, our gross profit percentage from professional services improved to (4)% for the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to (30)% for the year ended December 31, 2011, and (51)% and (43)% in the six months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, and (21)% and (202)% in fiscal 2011 and 2010, respectively. The improvement in gross profit percentages was also due in part to the adoption of the new revenue recognition accounting guidance commencing on July 1, 2010. Platform adoption. Our service includes access to our suite of applications, as well as access to our platform to create customer-built extensions to our suite of applications. Customers may also purchase the use of the platform to develop custom applications. Though in the near term we expect our revenue growth to be primarily driven by the pace of adoption and penetration of our suite of applications, we are investing resources to enhance the development capabilities of our platform. We believe the extensibility and simplicity of our platform is resulting in an increased use of our platform by our customers to create extensions of our applications or custom applications, and will enhance our ability to acquire new customers, increase upsells and sustain high renewal rates. Components of Results of Operations Revenues Subscription revenues. Subscription revenues are primarily comprised of fees which give customers access to our suite of on-demand applications, as well as access to our platform to build custom applications. Pricing includes multiple instances, hosting and support services, data backup and disaster recovery services, as well as future upgrades offered during the subscription period. In addition, we offer two separately priced enabling technologies, Discovery and Orchestration. We typically invoice our customers for subscription fees in annual increments upon initiation of the initial contract or subsequent renewal. Our average initial contract 27term was approximately 32 months for 2012. Our contracts are generally non-cancelable, though customers can terminate for breach if we materially fail to perform.We generate sales directly through our sales team and, to a lesser extent, through our channel partners. Sales to our channel partners are made at a discount and revenues are recorded at the discounted price when all revenue recognition criteria are met. In addition, in some cases, we pay referral fees to third parties typically ranging from 10% to 20% of the first year’s annual contract value. These fees are included in sales and marketing expense. Professional services and other revenues. Professional services revenues consist of fees associated with the implementation and configuration of our subscription service. Other revenues include customer training and attendance and sponsorship fees for our annual user conference, Knowledge. Prior to 2012, our pricing for professional services was predominantly on a fixed-fee basis. Beginning in December 2011, we began shifting our pricing model to a time-and-materials basis. Going forward, we anticipate the majority of our new business will be priced on a time-and-materials basis. Historically, most of our professional services engagements spanned six to eight months. During 2012, our professional services engagements spanned approximately four to six months. Historically, we billed for our fixed price professional services in two installments, with the first installment due up front and the second installment due at either a specified future date (usually approximately three months from the contract start date) or upon completion of the services. In December 2011, we changed these billing practices to bill for our fixed price professional services in installments based on milestones related to the completion of specified projects or specified dates. Our time-and-materials professional services are generally billed monthly in arrears based on actual hours and expenses incurred. Typical payment terms provide our customers pay us within 30 days of invoice. Prior to fiscal 2011, we recorded revenues from our professional services over a period commensurate with our subscription service contracts. However, the cost associated with our professional services engagements was recorded as the services were delivered, resulting in lower gross profit percentages in fiscal 2010 and 2009. On July 1, 2010, we adopted new revenue recognition accounting guidance on a prospective basis that enabled us to separately allocate value for our multiple element arrangements between our subscription revenues and professional services revenues, based on the best estimate of selling price. As a result, professional services revenues are recognized as the services are delivered, which is substantially the same period as the associated costs are incurred. This shift resulted in an increase to professional services and other revenues of $5.5 million for fiscal 2011. Refer to “Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates” below for further discussion of our revenue recognition accounting policy. Backlog. Backlog represents future amounts to be invoiced under our agreements and is not included in deferred revenue. As of December 31, 2012 and 2011, we had backlog of approximately $379 million and $210 million, respectively. We expect backlog will change from period to period for several reasons, including the timing and duration of customer subscription and professional services agreements, varying billing cycles of subscription agreements, and the timing of customer renewals.Overhead Allocation Overhead associated with benefits, facilities, IT costs and noncloud-based infrastructure related depreciation is allocated to cost of revenues and operating expenses based on headcount. Depreciation related to our cloud-based infrastructure are classified as cost of subscription revenues. Cost of Revenues Subscription cost of revenues. Cost of subscription revenues primarily consists of expenses related to hosting our service and providing support to our customers. These expenses are comprised of data center capacity costs; personnel and related costs directly associated with our cloud infrastructure and customer support, including salaries, benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation; and allocated overhead. Professional services and other cost of revenues. Cost of professional services and other revenues consists primarily of personnel and related costs directly associated with our professional services and training departments, including salaries, benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation; the costs of contracted third-party vendors; and allocated overhead.Professional services associated with the implementation and configuration of our subscription services are performed directly by our services team, as well as by contracted third-party vendors. Fees paid up-front to our third-party vendors are deferred and amortized to cost of revenues as the professional services are delivered. Fees owed to our third-party vendors are accrued over the same requisite service period. Internal payroll costs are similarly recognized as professional services are delivered. Cost of revenues associated with our professional services engagements contracted with third-party vendors as a percentage of professional services and other revenues was 26% and 55% in the year ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, 64% and 70% in the six months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, and 54% and 135% in fiscal 2011 and 2010, respectively.28 Sales and Marketing Expenses Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel and related expenses directly associated with our sales and marketing staff, including salaries, benefits, bonuses, commissions and stock-based compensation. Other costs included in this expense are third-party referral fees, marketing and promotional events, including our Knowledge conference, online marketing, product marketing and allocated overhead. Research and Development Expenses Research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel and related expenses directly associated with our research and development staff, including salaries, benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation, and allocated overhead. General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative expenses primarily consist of personnel and related expenses for our executive, finance, legal, human resources and administrative personnel, including salaries, benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation; legal, accounting and other professional services fees; other corporate expenses; and allocated overhead. Provision for Income Taxes Provision for income taxes consists of federal, state and foreign income taxes. Due to recent losses, we maintain a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2012. We consider all available evidence, both positive and negative, in assessing the extent to which a valuation allowance should be applied against our deferred tax assets.29Results of Operations To enhance comparability, the following table sets forth our results of operations for the periods presented.

Of the total increase in subscription revenues, 34% represented revenues from new customers acquired after December 31, 2011, and 66% represented revenues from existing customers at or prior to December 31, 2011. Our total customers increased 55% to 1,512 at December 31, 2012 from 974 at December 31, 2011. The average total revenues per customer, calculated based on revenue during the trailing four quarters divided by the average number of customers during the trailing four quarters, increased to approximately $190,000 from approximately $157,000 over this period primarily due to an increase in the number of subscriptions sold to existing customers and an increase in average new customer deal size. Of the $93.6 million total increase in subscription revenues for the year ended December 31, 2012, 86% represented sales to customers by our direct sales organization and 14% represented revenues from channel partners. Subscription revenues in North America represented 68% of the $93.6 million total increase in subscription revenues and 32% represented subscription revenues outside North America. During the year ended December 31, 2012, we continued to increase our focus on international markets through the addition of new channel partners, the expansion of our direct sales organization and the opening of additional sales and marketing offices in Sweden and Israel. The increase in professional services and other revenues of $22.0 million was primarily due to an increase in the services provided to our growing customer base in addition to a shift in our pricing model to a time-and-materials basis. We had an increase in revenues of $3.4 million associated with acceptances received in 2012 and an increase of $0.9 million associated with our Knowledge conference, held in May 2012. Revenues in North America represented 71% of the $22.0 million total increase in professional services and other revenues. Revenues outside North America represented the remaining 29%.32Cost of Revenues and Gross Profit Percentage Year Ended December 31, % Change 2012 2011 (dollars in thousands) Cost of revenues: Subscription$63,258 $24,288 160%Professional services and other40,751 22,336 82%Total cost of revenues$104,009 $46,624 123%Gross profit percentage: Subscription69 % 78 % Professional services and other(4)% (30)% Total gross profit percentage57 % 64 % Gross profit$139,703 $81,448 72%Headcount (at period end) Subscription218 119 83%Professional services and other183 98 87%Total headcount401 217 85% Cost of subscription revenues increased $39.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to the prior year, primarily due to increases in personnel-related and overhead expenses and expenses related to our data centers. Personnel-related expenses increased $18.6 million, consisting primarily of increased employee compensation, benefits and travel expenses of $15.5 million and additional stock-based compensation of $2.9 million. Overhead expenses increased $1.7 million. Growth in personnel-related and overhead expenses was driven by headcount growth and investments in our cloud infrastructure and support organizations. We expect personnel-related and overhead expenses to continue to increase as we continue to hire employees in our cloud infrastructure and support organizations in order to stay ahead of our growing customer demands. Hosting expenses related to our network infrastructure increased $6.9 million as we increased data center capacity to migrate customers from our managed service data centers to our co-location data centers and to support our customer growth. We also opened six new data centers since December 31, 2011. In the fourth quarter of 2012, we completed the transition of all our managed services data centers to our co-location data centers. Depreciation expense related to our equipment in our data centers increased $8.3 million, of which $6.6 million is due to purchases of network infrastructure to support our new data centers and growth within our existing data centers and $1.7 million is due to the accelerated depreciation of the assets located in our managed services data centers. Depreciation expense related to our managed services data centers for the year ended December 31, 2012 was $3.1 million. Additionally, outside services primarily related to enhancements to our data center security and the migration of our customers increased $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. We expect data center costs to continue to increase as we continue to grow our data center footprint and purchase new equipment to support our new customers. In 2013, we anticipate a substantial portion of our capital expenditures on data center capacity will be on new equipment within existing data centers to accommodate growth, which generally requires less capital expenditure than provisioning the equivalent capacity in a new data center. We may also add an additional data center during 2013 to service our growth in customers. Our subscription gross profit percentage decreased from 78% during the year ended December 31, 2011 to 69% for the year ended December 31, 2012. We anticipate cost of subscription revenues to increase as we increase capacity and invest in ongoing infrastructure improvements in our existing co-location data centers, which will partially offset the savings related to the exit of our managed service data centers during 2012. Cost of subscription revenues will also increase if we add new data centers. However, we anticipate cost of subscription revenues will grow at rates slower than our anticipated subscription revenue growth such that our gross profit percentage should improve during 2013. Cost of professional services and other revenues increased $18.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2012 as compared to the prior year. The overall increase was primarily attributable to increased personnel-related expenses of $15.5 million, consisting primarily of increased employee compensation, benefits and travel expenses of $13.8 million and additional stock-based compensation of $1.3 million, driven by headcount growth and an increase in our stock price. Overhead expenses increased $1.1 million also due to headcount growth. In addition, outside services expenses increased $1.8 million primarily due to an increase in implementation services as a result of our increased sales volume.33Our professional services and other gross profit (loss) percentage improved from (30)% during the year ended December 31, 2011 to (4)% during the year ended December 31, 2012. The improved gross profit percentage was primarily attributable to a shift in our pricing model to a time-and-materials basis and an increased focus on scoping projects and managing resource utilization. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2012, the amount of work we sub-contracted to our partners decreased as a percentage of total professional services and other revenues compared to the prior year. Professional services and other revenues include $2.0 million and $1.1 million for our Knowledge conference, for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Revenues from our Knowledge conference contributed 6 percentage points and 9 percentage points to the professional services and other gross profit percentage for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Expenses associated with the conference are included in sales and marketing expense. We expect our gross profit percentage from professional services and other to improve as we continue to realize the benefits of the shift in our pricing model to primarily time and materials. Sales and Marketing Year Ended December 31 % Change 2012 2011 (dollars in thousands) Sales and marketing$103,837 $52,896 96%Percentage of revenues42% 41% Headcount (at period end)350 242 45% Sales and marketing expenses increased $50.9 million due to the expansion of our sales force and increases in marketing programs to address additional opportunities in new and existing markets. Total headcount in sales and marketing increased 45% from December 31, 2011 to December 31, 2012, contributing to a $34.1 million increase in personnel-related expenses, consisting primarily of increased employee compensation, benefits and travel expenses associated with our marketing team and direct sales force of $25.5 million and additional stock-based compensation of $7.6 million. The increase is also due to increased overhead expenses of $2.3 million due to increased headcount. In addition, we incurred an increase of $4.8 million in marketing and event expenses primarily attributable to our Knowledge conference, which experienced a 102% increase in attendance year-over-year. Commissions increased $9.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2012 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2011, which was directly attributable to increased revenues and changes made to our commission plans. Commissions and referral fees amounted to 8% and 7% of subscription revenues in 2012 and 2011, respectively. These fees are deferred and amortized on a straight-line basis over the non-cancelable terms of the related customer contracts. During 2013, we expect sales and marketing expenses to increase in terms of dollars but remain relatively flat as a percent of total revenues as we continue to expand our direct sales force, increase our marketing activities, grow our international operations, build brand awareness and sponsor additional marketing events. In the second quarter of 2013, we expect to incur expenses of approximately $8.0 million to $9.0 million related to our Knowledge conference in May 2013 compared to $3.6 million incurred for the event in the second quarter of 2012, due to a significant increase in the size of the event. Research and Development Year Ended December 31 % Change 2012 2011 (dollars in thousands) Research and development$39,333 $11,276 249%Percentage of revenues16% 9% Headcount (at period end)200 83 141% Research and development expenses increased $28.1 million primarily due to increased personnel-related expenses of $25.3 million, consisting primarily of increased employee compensation, benefits and travel expenses associated with our research and development team of $19.3 million and additional stock-based compensation of $5.5 million. Overhead expenses also increased $1.5 million due to headcount growth. Total headcount in research and development increased 141% from December 31, 2011 to December 31, 2012 as we upgraded and extended our service offerings and developed new technologies. 34During 2013, we expect research and development expenses to increase in terms of dollar and as a percent of revenue as we continue to improve the existing functionality of our service, develop new applications to fill market needs and continue to enhance our core platform.

Personnel-related expenses increased $10.6 million, consisting primarily of increased employee compensation, benefits and travel expenses of $7.4 million and additional stock-based compensation of $3.1 million, as we added employees to support the growth of our business. Professional and outside service expenses increased $2.7 million, comprised primarily of accounting fees related to our external audit and tax consulting fees associated with our international expansion. Expenses from third-party software and service license agreements increased $1.5 million due to the implementation of additional systems to support the growth of our business. In August 2012, we relocated our San Diego, California office to another facility in the same city. As part of this move, we incurred $2.5 million in lease abandonment costs, which included a loss on disposal of our leasehold improvements and furniture and fixtures and a cease-use loss. During 2013, we expect general and administrative expenses to increase in terms of dollars but decrease as a percent of revenue as we continue to grow and incur expenses related to being a public company. These expenses include higher legal, corporate insurance and accounting expenses, and the additional expenses of achieving and maintaining compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and related regulations. We also anticipate to incur exits costs related to the relocation of our San Jose facility of less than $1.0 million and may incur other lease abandonment costs in the future if our existing leases cannot accommodate our future headcount growth. Interest and Other Income, net Year Ended December 31 % Change 2012 2011 (dollars in thousands) Interest and other income, net$1,604 $(1,129) NMPercentage of revenues1% (1)% Interest and other income, net, primarily consists of foreign currency transaction gains and losses. The increase is due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar compared to the prior year and an increase in interest income of $0.3 million related to our investments in marketable securities. While we have not engaged in the hedging of our foreign currency transactions to date, we are presently evaluating the costs and benefits of initiating such a program and may hedge selected significant transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar in the future. Provision for Income Taxes Year Ended December 31 % Change 2012 2011 (dollars in thousands) Income before income taxes$(35,980) $101 NMProvision for income taxes1,368 1,758 (22)%Effective tax rate(4)% 1,741% 35The provision for income taxes decreased $0.4 million, primarily as a result of our operating loss, a lower proportion of earnings in taxable jurisdictions, and benefit from California research and development credits in the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to the prior year. See Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements for our reconciliation of income taxes at the statutory federal rate to the provision for income taxes. We continue to maintain a full valuation allowance on our federal and state deferred tax assets, and the significant components of the tax expense recorded are current cash taxes in various jurisdictions. The cash tax expenses are impacted by each jurisdiction’s individual tax rates, laws on timing of recognition of income and deductions and availability of net operating losses and tax credits. In December 2011, we reorganized our international operations and established our non-U.S. headquarters in the Netherlands, which has an effective tax rate that is lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate. Given the full valuation allowance, sensitivity of current cash taxes to local rules and our foreign restructuring, we expect our effective tax rate could fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis and could be adversely affected to the extent earnings are lower than anticipated in countries that have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher statutory rates. The earnings of our foreign subsidiaries are considered to be permanently reinvested outside of the United States. Comparison of the six months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 Revenues Six Months Ended December 31, % Change 2011 2010 (dollars in thousands) Revenues: Subscription$64,886 $33,191 95%Professional services and other8,489 4,753 79%Total revenues$73,375 $37,944 93%Percentage of revenues: Subscription88% 87% Professional services and other12 13 Total100% 100% Revenues increased $35.4 million, primarily due to the increase in subscription revenues of $31.7 million. Of the total increase in subscription revenues, 55% represented revenues from new customers acquired after December 31, 2010, and 45% represented revenues from existing customers at or prior to December 31, 2010. Our total customers increased 62% from December 31, 2010 to December 31, 2011. The average subscription revenues per customer increased 19% over this period primarily due to an increase in the number of subscriptions sold to existing customers. Of the $31.7 million total increase in subscription revenues for the six months ended December 31, 2011, 81% represented sales to customers by our direct sales organization and 19% represented revenues from channel partners. Subscription revenues in North America represented 67% of the $31.7 million total increase in subscription revenues and 33% represented subscription revenues outside North America. The increase in revenues from channel partners was due primarily to increased market adoption of our subscription service through sales by our existing channel partners and to a lesser extent the addition of new channel partners. The increase in subscription revenues outside North America was due primarily to increased adoption of our subscription service through sales by our existing channel partners and direct sales organization, and to a lesser extent the addition of new channel partners and the expansion of our direct sales organization. During the six months ended December 31, 2011, we opened additional sales and marketing offices in Denmark and France, which did not account for a significant portion of increased revenues during the period. The increase in professional services and other revenues of $3.7 million was primarily due to the growth in our customer base. Revenues in North America represented 73% of the $3.7 million total increase in professional services and other revenues. Revenues outside North America represented the remaining 27%. 36Cost of Revenues and Gross Profit Percentage Six Months Ended December 31, % Change 2011 2010 (dollars in thousands) Cost of revenues: Subscription$15,073 $6,096 147%Professional services and other12,850 6,778 90%Total cost of revenues$27,923 $12,874 117%Gross profit percentage: Subscription77 % 82 % Professional services and other(51) (43) Total gross profit percentage62 % 66 % Gross profit$45,452 $25,070 81%Headcount (at period end): Subscription119 51 133%Professional services and other98 50 96%Total headcount217 101 115% Cost of subscription revenues increased $9.0 million during the six months ended December 31, 2011 as compared to the same period in the prior year. The overall increase in cost of subscription revenues was primarily attributed to increased personnel-related expenses of $4.9 million, consisting of increased employee compensation, benefits and travel expenses of $4.5 million and additional stock-based compensation of $0.4 million. The increase in personnel-related expenses was driven by headcount growth. In addition, hosting fees for our network infrastructure increased $1.6 million as we increased data center capacity to support our growth. At December 31, 2011, we delivered our service from six data centers in North America and seven data centers internationally, compared to three data centers in North America and five data centers internationally at December 31, 2010. Depreciation expense also increased $1.1 million as we started the transition of our network infrastructure from a managed services hosting model to a co-location model.Our subscription gross profit percentage decreased from 82% to 77% during the six months ended December 31, 2011 as compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to these increased expenses. Cost of professional services and other revenues increased $6.1 million during the six months ended December 31, 2011 as compared to the same period in the prior year. The overall increase was primarily attributed to increased personnel-related expenses of $3.7 million, consisting of increased employee compensation, benefits and travel expenses of $3.5 million and additional stock-based compensation of $0.2 million driven by headcount growth. In addition, outside services expenses increased $1.9 million primarily due to additional fees paid to third-parties to provide implementation services. Our professional services and other gross profit percentage decreased from (43)% to (51)% during the six months ended December 31, 2011 as compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to these increased expenses.

In addition, we incurred an increase of $3.1 million in commissions, which was directly attributed to increased revenues and changes made to our commission plans in the six months ended December 31, 2011. Marketing and event expenses increased $1.3 million due to our continued efforts to generate sales leads and build brand awareness.

During the six months ended December 31, 2011, we recorded a provision for income taxes principally attributable to foreign taxes, U.S. federal taxes and California taxes. We maintain a full valuation allowance on our federal and state deferred tax assets, and the significant components of the tax expense recorded are current cash taxes in various jurisdictions. The cash tax expenses are impacted by each jurisdiction’s individual tax rates, laws on timing of recognition of income and deductions and availability of net operating losses and tax credits. In December 2011, we reorganized our international operations and established our non-U.S. headquarters in the Netherlands, which has an effective tax rate that is lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate.

Our total customers increased 68% from June 30, 2010 to June 30, 2011. The average subscription revenues per customer increased 19% over this period primarily due to an increase in the number of subscriptions sold to existing customers. Of the $39.1 million total increase in subscription revenues for fiscal 2011, 87% represented sales to customers by our direct sales organization and 13% represented revenues from channel partners. Subscription revenues in North America represented 75% of the $39.1 million total increase in subscription revenues and 25% represented subscription revenues outside North America. The increase in professional services and other revenues of $10.2 million was primarily due to the prospective adoption of new revenue accounting guidance resulting in an increase to professional services and other revenues of $5.5 million in fiscal 2011. The remaining increase of $4.7 million was attributable to the growth in our customer base. Revenues in North America represented 83% of the $10.2 million total increase in professional services and other revenues. Revenues outside North America represented 17% of the $10.2 million total increase in professional services and other revenues. The increase in subscription revenues outside North America was due primarily to increased adoption of our subscription service through sales from new 39channel partners and to a lesser extent, sales by our existing channel partners and the expansion of our direct sales organization. During fiscal 2011, we opened additional sales and marketing offices in Australia and the Netherlands.

These personnel-related expenses increases were driven by headcount. In addition, hosting fees for our network infrastructure increased $2.1 million as we increased data center capacity to support our growth. At June 30, 2011, we delivered our service from six data centers in North America and five data centers internationally compared to three data centers in the United States and five data centers internationally at June 30, 2010. Depreciation expense also increased $0.8 million as we started the transition of our network infrastructure from a managed service hosting model to a co-location model. Our subscription gross profit percentage decreased from 84% to 81% from fiscal 2010 to fiscal 2011 primarily due to these increased expenses. Cost of professional services and other revenues increased $6.5 million during fiscal 2011 as compared to the same period in the prior year. The overall increase in cost of professional services and other revenues was primarily attributed to increased employee compensation, benefits and travel expenses of $3.1 million driven by headcount growth. In addition, outside services expenses increased $3.1 million primarily due to additional fees paid to third parties to provide implementation services. Our professional services and other gross profit percentage improved from (202)% to (21)% from fiscal 2010 to fiscal 2011, primarily due to increased revenues as a result of the prospective adoption of new revenue recognition accounting guidance. This guidance enabled us to recognize professional services revenues as the services are delivered.

The cash tax expenses are impacted by each jurisdiction’s individual tax rates, laws on timing of recognition of income and deductions and availability of net operating losses and tax credits. Given the full valuation allowance and sensitivity of current cash taxes to local rules, our effective tax rate fluctuates significantly on an annual basis and could be adversely affected to the extent earnings are lower than anticipated in countries that have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher statutory rates.

We sign a significantly higher percentage of agreements with new customers, as well as renewal agreements with existing customers, in the quarters ended June 30 and December 31. The increase in customer agreements for the quarters ended June 30 is primarily as 43a result of the historical terms of our commission plans to incentivize our direct sales force to meet their quotas by June 30, our prior fiscal year end. The increase in customer agreements for the quarter ended December 31 can be attributed to large enterprise account buying patterns typical in the software industry. Furthermore, we usually sign a significant portion of these agreements during the last month, and often the last two weeks, of each quarter. This seasonality is reflected to a much lesser extent, and sometimes is not immediately apparent, in our revenues, due to the fact that we recognize subscription revenues over the term of the license agreement, which is generally 12 to 36 months. As a result of the change in our fiscal year end from June 30 to December 31 and changes to our commission plans to provide for earlier incentives, we may not see the same seasonality pattern for future quarters ended June 30. Although these seasonal factors are common in the technology industry, historical patterns should not be considered a reliable indicator of our future sales activity or performance. Our revenues have increased over the periods presented due to increased sales to new customers, as well as upsells to existing customers. Our operating expenses have increased sequentially in every quarter primarily due to increases in headcount and other related expenses to support our growth. We anticipate these expenses will continue to increase in future periods as we continue to focus on investing in the long-term growth of our business. Beginning in the quarter ended September 30, 2011, we accelerated investments in our headcount and infrastructure to drive our future growth. As a result, we generated net losses for each of the quarters in the period from the three months ended December 31, 2011 through the three months ended December 31, 2012 despite significant revenue growth in the period.

At December 31, 2012, we had $119.0 million in cash and cash equivalents, of which $7.7 million represented cash located overseas. We also had $195.7 million in short-term investments consisting of commercial paper, corporate debt securities and U.S. government agency securities. Our historical cash flows from operating activities have been significantly impacted by customer billings and payment terms, as well as operating expenses related to sales and marketing, research and development, and expenses related to our cloud infrastructure and professional services. Based on our current level of operations and anticipated growth, we believe our current cash, cash equivalents and short term investments, and cash flows from operating activities will be sufficient to fund our operating needs for at least the next 12 months, barring unforeseen circumstances. In 2013, we expect to reinvest our cash flows from operations back into the business to support our growth. Our primary short-term needs for cash, which are subject to change, include expenditures related to the growth of our sales and marketing and cloud infrastructure organizations, including the expansion of data centers, and the acquisition of fixed assets and investments in office facilities to accommodate our growth. We made capital expenditures of $42.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2012 and anticipate increasing capital expenditures in 2013, primarily related to investments in our cloud infrastructure and facilities build-outs to accommodate our growth. In 2013, we expect our cash flows from operations less capital expenditures to be relatively flat compared to 2012. Our short-term needs for cash also include expenditures related to: •the growth of our sales and marketing and professional services efforts;44•support of our sales and marketing efforts related to our current and future services and applications, including expansion of our direct sales force and support resources both in the United States and abroad;•the continued advancement of research and development; and•the expansion and buildout of our facilities, including costs of leasing additional facilities.To the extent existing cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and cash from operations are not sufficient to fund our future activities, we may need to raise additional funds. Although we are not currently a party to any agreement or letter of intent with respect to potential investments in, or acquisitions of, complementary businesses, services or technologies, we may enter into these types of arrangements in the future, which could also require us to seek additional equity financing or use our cash resources. We have no present understandings, commitments or agreements to enter into any such acquisitions. Depending on certain growth opportunities, we may choose to accelerate investments in sales and marketing, cloud infrastructure, professional services, and research and development, which may require the use of proceeds from our public offerings. Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities in the year ended December 31, 2012 was $48.8 million, reflecting our net loss of $37.3 million, adjusted by non-cash charges including $27.9 million for stock-based compensation, $13.7 million for the amortization of deferred commissions, $13.5 million for depreciation and amortization and $2.5 million for lease abandonment costs, and non-cash benefits including $1.7 million tax benefit from exercise of stock options and changes in our operating assets and liabilities. Our overall net change in operating assets and liabilities was primarily comprised of an increase of $64.8 million in deferred revenue, a $22.9 million increase in accrued liabilities, an increase of $4.2 million in other long-term liabilities, and an increase of $4.9 million in accounts payable, partially offset by a $33.3 million increase in accounts receivable, a $29.2 million increase in deferred commissions, a $2.5 million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets and a $2.2 million decrease in deferred rent. The increases in deferred revenue, deferred commissions and accounts receivable were primarily due to increased sales in the year ended December 31, 2012. The increase in accrued liabilities, accounts payable and prepaid expenses are due to the growth of our business and increased headcount of 79% during the year ended December 31, 2012. The decrease in deferred rent is offset by the increase in other long-term liabilities related to the relocation of our San Diego office to another facility in San Diego in August 2012. Net cash provided by operating activities in the year ended December 31, 2011 was $40 million, reflecting our net loss of $1.7 million, adjusted by non-cash charges including $7.5 million for stock-based compensation, $5.9 million for the amortization of deferred commissions, and $3.0 million for depreciation, and changes in our operating assets and liabilities. The fluctuations in our operating assets and liabilities were primarily attributed to an increase of $51.3 million in deferred revenue, $10.8 million increase in accrued liabilities, $3.1 million increase in deferred rent and $2.6 million increase in accounts payable partially offset by an increase of $27.5 million in accounts receivable, $11.7 million increase in deferred commissions and $3.7 million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets. The increase in deferred revenue, accounts receivable and deferred commissions was primarily due to increased sales. The increase in deferred rent, accrued liabilities, accounts payable and prepaid expenses was primarily due to the growth of our business, increased headcount and the resulting move of our San Diego office to a new building during the period. Our total headcount increased 141% during the year ended December 31, 2011. Net cash provided by operating activities in the six months ended December 31, 2011 reflected our net loss of $6.7 million, adjusted by non-cash charges including $5.6 million for stock-based compensation, $3.5 million for amortization of deferred commissions and $2.0 million for depreciation, and changes in our operating assets and liabilities. The fluctuations in our operating assets and liabilities were primarily attributed to a $30.0 million increase in deferred revenue and a $6.9 million increase in accrued liabilities, partially offset by a $20.4 million increase in accounts receivable and an $8.3 million increase in deferred commissions. The increase in deferred revenue, accounts receivable and deferred commissions was primarily due to increased sales. Our sales and marketing headcount increased 73% during the six months ended December 31, 2011. The increase in accrued liabilities was due to the growth in our business and increased headcount. Net cash provided by operating activities in the six months ended December 31, 2010 reflected our net income of $4.8 million and changes in our working capital. The fluctuations in our operating assets and liabilities were primarily attributed to a $12.6 million increase in deferred revenue, partially offset by a $7.6 million increase in accounts receivable. The increase in deferred revenue and accounts receivable was primarily due to increased sales. Net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2011 reflected our net income of $9.8 million, adjusted by non-cash charges including $4.0 million for the amortization of deferred commissions and $3.0 million for stock-based compensation, and changes in our working capital. The fluctuations in our operating assets and liabilities were primarily attributed to a $33.9 million 45increase in deferred revenue, a $5.4 million increase in accrued liabilities and a $3.2 million increase in deferred rent, partially offset by a $14.8 million increase in accounts receivable and a $5.6 million increase in deferred commissions. The increase in deferred revenue, accounts receivable and deferred commissions was primarily due to increased sales in fiscal 2011. The increase in accrued liabilities and deferred rent was primarily due to the growth of our business and the move of our San Diego office to a new building during the period. Net cash used in operating activities in fiscal 2010 reflected our net loss of $29.7 million, which included non-cash compensation expense of $30.8 million related to the premium paid to eligible stockholders for the repurchase of common stock in connection with the sale of Series D preferred stock, and the changes in our operating assets and liabilities. The fluctuations in our working capital were primarily attributed to a $24.0 million increase in deferred revenue and an $8.9 million increase in accrued liabilities, partially offset by a $5.3 million increase in deferred commissions, a $5.2 million increase in accounts receivable and a $4.9 million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets. The increase in accrued liabilities included $4.5 million in withholding taxes associated with the repurchase of our founder’s shares as part of the sale and issuance Series D preferred stock, with a corresponding offset of $4.5 million for a receivable in prepaid expenses and other current assets owed to us by our founder. The remaining increase to accrued liabilities was due to the increase in headcount. Investing Activities In the year ended December 31, 2012, cash used in investing activities was primarily attributed to the purchase of $240.6 million in short-term investments offset by maturities of $42.5 million. In addition, we paid cash for capital expenditures of $42.1 million primarily related to the purchase of servers, networking equipment and storage infrastructure to support the expansion of our data centers as well as investments in leasehold improvements and furniture and equipment to support our headcount growth. We expect these investments to continue in 2013. In the year ended December 31, 2011, the six months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, and fiscal 2011 and 2010, our investing activities primarily consisted of capital expenditures related to the purchase of servers, networking equipment and storage infrastructure to support the expansion of our data centers and tenant improvements associated with the growth of our office facilities. Financing Activities Our financing activities have primarily consisted of equity issuances, including excess tax benefits from stock award activities. In the year ended December 31, 2012, cash provided by financing activities primarily consisted of initial public offering proceeds of $169.8 million, net of paid underwriter discounts, commissions and issuance costs, follow-on offering proceeds of $50.6 million, net of paid underwriter discounts, commissions and issuance costs, $17.8 million in gross proceeds from the issuance of 1,750,980 shares of common stock at a price of $10.20 per share through a private placement with a new stockholder and $3.9 million in proceeds from the issuance of common stock through the exercise and early exercise of employee stock options. These increases in cash were slightly offset by purchases of common stock and restricted stock from stockholders of $2.0 million. In the year ended December 31, 2011, cash provided by financing activities primarily consisted of $3.1 million in proceeds from the issuance of common stock through the exercise and early exercise of employee stock options. In the six months ended December 31, 2011, cash provided by financing activities primarily consisted of $2.1 million in proceeds from the issuance of common stock through the exercise and early exercise of employee stock options. In the six months ended December 31, 2010, we had no significant financing activities. In fiscal 2011, cash provided by financing activities primarily consisted of $1.1 million in proceeds from the issuance of common stock through the exercise and early exercise of employee stock options. In fiscal 2010, we received net proceeds of $51.2 million from the sale and issuance of Series D preferred stock, which was used to repurchase and subsequently cancel shares of common stock from eligible stockholders and warrants to purchase Series B preferred stock from a warrant holder. Contractual Obligations and Commitments Contractual obligations represent future cash commitments and liabilities under agreements with third parties, and exclude orders for goods and services entered into in the normal course of business that are not enforceable or legally binding. 46The following table represents our known contractual obligations as of December 31, 2012, aggregated by type: Payments Due by PeriodContractual ObligationsTotal LessThan1 Year 1 – 3Years 3 – 5Years MoreThan5 Years (in thousands)Operating leases: Data centers(1)$13,077 $7,474 $5,603 $— $—Facilities space(2)98,213 6,251 21,759 22,776 47,427Total operating leases$111,290 $13,725 $27,362 $22,776 $47,427 (1)Operating leases for data centers represent our principal commitment for co-location facilities for data center capacity.(2)Operating leases for facilities space represents our principal commitments, which consists of obligations under leases for office space. Lease commitments of $9.9 million related to the lease for our former San Diego office are also included in the table above. In addition to the obligations in the table above, approximately $0.9 million of unrecognized tax benefits have been recorded as liabilities as of December 31, 2012. It is uncertain as to if or when such amounts may be settled. We have also recorded a liability for potential penalties of $0.2 million and interest of $0.1 million related to these unrecognized tax benefits.Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements During all periods presented, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. As such, we are not exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in those types of relationships. Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates Our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. These items are monitored and analyzed by us for changes in facts and circumstances, and material changes in these estimates could occur in the future. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Changes in estimates are reflected in reported results for the period in which they become known. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. While our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements, we believe that the following accounting policies are critical to the process of making significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our audited consolidated financial statements. Revenue Recognition We commence revenue recognition when all of the following conditions are met: •There is persuasive evidence of an arrangement;•The service has been provided to the customer;•The collection of related fees is reasonably assured; and•The amount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable.Signed agreements are used as evidence of an arrangement. If a signed contract by the customer does not exist, we have historically used either a purchase order or a signed order form as evidence of an arrangement. In cases where both a signed contract and either a purchase order or signed order form exist, we consider the signed contract to be the final persuasive evidence of an arrangement. 47Subscription revenues are recognized ratably over the contract term beginning on the commencement date of each contract, which is the date we make our service available to our customers. Once our service is available to customers, amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue. Our professional services are priced either on a fixed-fee basis or on a time-and-materials basis. Professional services and other revenues are recognized as the services are delivered using a proportional performance model. Such services are delivered over a short period of time. In instances where final acceptance of the services are required before revenues are recognized, professional services revenues and the associated costs are deferred until all acceptance criteria have been met. We assess collectibility based on a number of factors such as past collection history and creditworthiness of the customer. If we determine collectibility is not reasonably assured, we defer revenue recognition until collectibility becomes reasonably assured. We assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment. Our arrangements do not include general rights of return. We have multiple element arrangements comprised of subscription fees and professional services. In October 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, ratified authoritative accounting guidance regarding revenue recognition for arrangements with multiple deliverables effective for fiscal periods beginning on or after June 15, 2010. The guidance affects the determination of separate units of accounting in arrangements with multiple deliverables and the allocation of transaction consideration to each of the identified units of accounting. Previously, a delivered item was considered a separate unit of accounting when (i) it had value to the customer on a stand-alone basis, (ii) there was objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items, and (iii) there was no general right of return relative to the delivered services or the performance of the undelivered services was probable and substantially controlled by the vendor. The new guidance eliminates the requirement for objective and reliable evidence of fair value to exist for the undelivered items in order for a delivered item to be treated as a separate unit of accounting. The guidance also requires arrangement consideration to be allocated at the inception of the arrangement to all deliverables using the relative-selling-price method and eliminates the use of the residual method of allocation. Under the relative-selling-price method, the selling price for each deliverable is determined using vendor-specific objective evidence, or VSOE, of selling price or third-party evidence, or TPE, of selling price if VSOE does not exist. If neither VSOE nor TPE of selling price exists for a deliverable, the guidance requires an entity to determine the best estimate of selling price, or BESP. Prior to the adoption of this authoritative accounting guidance, we did not have objective and reliable evidence of fair value for the items in our multiple element arrangements. As a result, we accounted for subscription and professional services revenues as one unit of account and recognized total contracted revenues ratably over the contracted term of the subscription agreement. We adopted the new guidance on a prospective basis for fiscal 2011. As a result, this guidance was applied to all revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified since July 1, 2010. The following table summarizes the effects of this new guidance on our consolidated balance sheets and statements of comprehensive income (loss) (in thousands): As of and for the Fiscal Year EndedJune 30, 2011 AsReported UnderPreviousAccountingGuidance Impact ofAdoption ofASU 2009-13Total deferred revenue$74,646 $81,036 $(6,390)Revenues: Subscription$79,191 $78,305 $886Professional services and other13,450 7,946 5,504Total revenues$92,641 $86,251 $6,390 Upon adoption of this authoritative accounting guidance, we have accounted for subscription and professional services revenues as separate units of accounting. To qualify as a separate unit of accounting, the delivered item must have value to the customer on a standalone basis. Our subscription service has standalone value as it is routinely sold separately by us, we provide customers access to our subscription service at the beginning of the contract term, and our on-demand application is fully functional without any additional development, modification or customization. In determining whether professional services have standalone value, we consider the following factors for each professional services agreement: availability of the services from other vendors, the nature of the professional services, the timing of when the professional services contract was signed in comparison to the subscription service start date and the contractual dependence of the subscription service on the customer’s satisfaction with the professional services work. Our professional services, including implementation and configuration services, are not so unique and complex that other vendors cannot provide them. In some instances, our customers independently contract with third-party vendors 48to do the implementation and we regularly outsource implementation services to contracted third-party vendors. As a result, we concluded professional services, including implementation and configuration services, also have standalone value. We determine the selling price of each deliverable in the arrangement using the relative-selling price method based on the selling price hierarchy. The selling price for each unit of account is based on the BESP since VSOE and TPE are not available for our subscription service or professional services and other. The BESP for each deliverable is determined primarily by considering the historical selling price of these deliverables in similar transactions as well as other factors, including, but not limited to, market competition, review of stand-alone sales and pricing practices. The total arrangement fee for these multiple element arrangements is then allocated to the separate units of account based on the relative selling price. The method used to determine the BESP for our subscription service is consistent with the method used to determine prices for our services that are sold regularly on a standalone basis. In determining the appropriate pricing structure, we consider the extent of competitive pricing of similar products, marketing analyses and other feedback from analysts. We price our subscription service based on the number of users with a defined process role, according to a tiered structure. The BESP for our subscription service is based upon the historical selling price of these deliverables. Prior to December 2011, our professional services were priced on a fixed-fee basis as a percentage of the subscription fee. We also prepared a standard build-up cost analysis to estimate the fixed fee for our professional services based on the estimated level of effort to complete the professional services. If professional services were priced below the expected range due to discounting, fees allocated to professional services were limited to the amount not contingent upon the delivery of our subscription service. In December 2011, we began shifting our pricing model for professional services to a time-and-materials basis. In limited circumstances, we grant certain customers the right to deploy our subscription service on the customers’ own servers without significant penalty. We have analyzed all of the elements in these particular multiple element arrangements and determined we do not have sufficient VSOE of fair value to allocate revenue to our subscription service and professional services. We defer all revenue under the arrangement until the commencement of the subscription service and any associated professional services. Once the subscription service and the associated professional services have commenced, the entire fee from the arrangement is recognized ratably over the remaining period of the arrangement. Deferred Commissions We defer expenses associated with commission payments made to our direct sales force and referral fees paid to independent third-parties. The commissions are deferred and amortized to sales expense over the non-cancelable terms of the related contracts with our customers. The commission payments are a direct and incremental cost of the revenue arrangements. The deferred commission amounts are recoverable through the future revenue streams under the non-cancelable customer contracts. We believe this is preferable to expensing sales commissions as incurred because the commission charges are so closely related to revenues they should be recorded as an asset and charged to expense over the same period the revenues are recognized. Additionally, we believe this policy election enhances the comparability of our consolidated financial statements to those of other companies in our industry. Stock-Based Compensation We measure compensation expense for all stock-based payments made to employees and directors based on the fair value of the award as of the date of grant. The expense is recognized, net of estimated forfeitures, over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective award. We estimate forfeitures based upon our historical experience. At each period end, we review the estimated forfeiture rate and make changes as factors affecting the forfeiture rate calculations and assumptions change. We use the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to determine the fair value of our stock-based awards. Determining the fair value under this model requires the use of inputs that are subjective and generally require significant analysis and judgment to develop. These inputs include the fair value of our common stock, expected volatility, expected term, risk-free interest rate, and expected dividend yield, which are estimated as follows: •Fair value of our common stock: Because our stock was not publicly traded prior to our initial public offering, we estimated the fair value of our common stock, as discussed in “Common Stock Valuations” below. Following our initial public offering in June 2012, our common stock was valued by reference to its publicly traded price.•Expected volatility: We use the historic volatility of publicly traded peer companies as an estimate for our expected volatility. In considering peer companies, we assess characteristics such as industry, stage of development, size, and financial leverage. For each period, the peer group of publicly traded companies used to determine expected volatility was the same as the peer group used to determine the fair value of our common stock. We intend to continue to consistently apply this process using the same or similar public companies until a sufficient amount of historical information regarding the volatility of our own common stock share price becomes available.49•Expected term: We estimate the expected term using the simplified method due to the lack of historical exercise activity for our company. The simplified method calculates the expected term as the mid-point between the vesting date and the contractual expiration date of the award.•Risk-free interest rate: The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for the expected term of the stock-based award.•Dividend yield: Our expected dividend yield is zero, as we have not and do not currently intend to declare dividends in the foreseeable future.If any assumptions used in the Black-Scholes model change significantly, stock-based compensation for future awards may differ materially compared with the awards granted previously. Common Stock Valuations Prior to our initial public offering, the fair value of the common stock underlying our stock options was determined by our board of directors, which intended all options granted to be exercisable at a price per share not less than the per share fair value of our common stock underlying those options on the date of grant. The valuations of our common stock were determined in accordance with the guidelines outlined in the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Practice Aid, Valuation of Privately-Held-Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation. The assumptions we used in the valuation model were based on future expectations combined with management judgment. In the absence of a public trading market, our board of directors with input from management exercised significant judgment and considered numerous objective and subjective factors to determine the fair value of our common stock as of the date of each option grant, including the following factors: •contemporaneous independent valuations performed at periodic intervals;•the prices, rights, preferences and privileges of our convertible preferred stock relative to the common stock;•recent sales of our common stock;•our operating and financial performance and forecast;•current business conditions;•the hiring of key personnel;•our stage of development;•the likelihood of achieving a liquidity event for the shares of common stock underlying these stock options, such as an initial public offering or sale of our company, given prevailing market conditions;•any adjustment necessary to recognize a lack of marketability for our common stock;•the market performance of comparable publicly traded technology companies;•mergers and acquisition activity in our industry; and•the U.S. and global capital market conditions. In order to determine the fair value of our common stock underlying award grants prior to our initial public offering, we considered contemporaneous valuations of our stock. We utilized the probability weighted expected return method, or PWERM, approach to allocate value to our common shares. The PWERM approach employs various market approach and income approach calculations depending upon the likelihood of various liquidation scenarios. For each of the various scenarios, an equity value is estimated and the rights and preferences for each stockholder class are considered to allocate the equity value to common shares. The common share value is then multiplied by a discount factor reflecting the calculated discount rate and the timing of the event. Lastly, the common share value is multiplied by an estimated probability for each scenario. The probability and timing of each scenario were based upon discussions between our board of directors and our management team. Under the PWERM, the value of our common stock was based upon four possible future events for our company: •initial public offering, or IPO;•strategic merger or sale;•remaining a private company; and•dissolution.50The market approach uses similar companies or transactions in the marketplace. We utilized the guideline company method of the market approach for determining the fair value of our common stock under the initial public offering scenario. We identified companies similar to our business and used these guideline companies to develop relevant market multiples and ratios. We selected the peer group of companies based on their size, business model, industry, business description and developmental stage. While we believe that our proprietary platform to automate enterprise IT operations that we provide to our customers differentiates us from other software companies, we selected this peer group from publicly traded companies that are similarly viewed as being in the information technology industry and offering their services under a SaaS business model. We then applied these market multiples and ratios to our financial forecasts to create an indication of total equity value. Under the strategic merger or sale scenario, we utilized the guideline company method and the guideline transaction method of the market approach to determine the fair value of the common stock. The guideline transaction method compares the operating results and market value of the equity or invested capital of acquired companies similar to our business. The income approach, which we utilized to assess fair value of the common stock under the assumption we remained a private company, is an estimate of the present value of the future monetary benefits generated by an investment in that asset. Specifically, debt free cash flows and the estimated terminal value are discounted at an appropriate risk-adjusted discount rate to estimate the total invested capital value of the entity. Under the dissolution scenario, we assumed no value remained to be allocated to our common stockholders. We continually reviewed and updated the selection of companies in the peer group of publicly traded companies to better reflect the size and developmental stage of our company and to account for the acquisition of certain of the peer companies. Stock Options and RSUs Granted Subsequent to our Initial Public Offering For stock options and RSUs granted subsequent to our initial public offering, our board of directors determined the fair value based on the closing price of our common stock as reported on the New York Stock Exchange on the date of grant.Income Taxes Our provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits reflect our best assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid. Significant judgments and estimates based on interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations in the United States and the numerous foreign jurisdictions where we are subject to income tax are required in determining our provision for income taxes. Changes in tax laws, statutory tax rates, and estimates of our future taxable income could impact the deferred tax assets and liabilities provided for in the consolidated financial statements and would require an adjustment to the provision for income taxes. Deferred tax assets are regularly assessed to determine the likelihood they will be recovered from future taxable income. A valuation allowance is established when we believe it is more likely than not the future realization of all or some of a deferred tax asset will not be achieved. In evaluating our ability to recover deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction in which they arise we consider all available positive and negative evidence. Factors reviewed include the cumulative pre-tax book income for the past three years, scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, our history of earnings and reliable forecasting, projections of pre-tax book income over the foreseeable future, and the impact of any feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. We recognize the impact of a tax position in our consolidated financial statements only if that position is more likely than not of being sustained upon examination by taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. Tax authorities regularly examine our returns in the jurisdictions in which we do business and we regularly assess the tax risk of our return filing positions. Due to the complexity of some of the uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in payments that are materially different from our current estimate of the tax liability. These differences, as well as any interest and penalties, will be reflected in the provision for income taxes in the period in which they are determined. Cease-Use Loss upon Exit of Facility In August 2012, we relocated our San Diego office to another facility in San Diego. As part of this move, we incurred lease abandonment costs of $2.5 million, which primarily consists of a loss on disposal of assets and a cease-use loss recorded upon vacating our prior San Diego office. The lease on our prior headquarters facility expires in 2019. The cease-use loss was calculated as the present value of the remaining lease obligation offset by estimated sublease rental receipts during the remaining lease period, adjusted for deferred items and lease incentives. In calculating the cease-use loss, management is required to make significant judgments to estimate the present value of future cash flows from the assumed sublease. The key assumptions used in our discounted cash flow model include the amount and timing of estimated sublease rental receipts, and a credit-adjusted, risk-free discount rate of 5.08%. These assumptions are subjective in nature and the actual future cash flows could differ from our estimates, resulting in significant adjustments to the cease-use loss recorded or to be recorded. 51Recent Accounting PronouncementsIn February 2013, the FASB issued new disclosure guidance related to the presentation of the Statement of Comprehensive Income. This guidance requires the disclosure of the effect of significant amounts reclassified from each component of accumulated other comprehensive income based on its source and the income statement line items affected by the reclassification. We will adopt this accounting standard upon its effective date for periods beginning on or after December 15, 2012, and this adoption will not have any impact on our financial position or results of operations.ITEM 7A.QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Foreign Currency Exchange Risk We have foreign currency risks related to our revenue and operating expenses denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, primarily the Euro and British Pound Sterling. Revenues outside of North America as a percentage of revenue was 29% and 27% during the year ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, 29% and 26% during the six months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and 25% and 28% in fiscal 2011 and 2010, respectively. Changes in exchange rates may negatively affect our revenue and other operating results as expressed in U.S. dollars. We have experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income as a result of transaction gains or losses related to revaluing certain current asset and current liability balances that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entities in which they are recorded. For the most part, we are unable to accurately forecast the changes in exchange rates and consequent gains and losses from such fluctuations. We recognized foreign currency net gains of $1.1 million, $1.6 million and $0.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2012, the six months ended December 31, 2011 and fiscal 2010, respectively. We recognized foreign currency net losses of $1.3 million, $0.6 million and $0.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2011, fiscal 2011 and the six months ended December 31, 2010, respectively. While we have not engaged in the hedging of our foreign currency transactions to date, we are presently evaluating the costs and benefits of initiating such a program and may in the future hedge selected significant transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar.We estimate that a 10% decline in the value of the U.S. dollar as measured against the other currencies in which our transactions are denominated would have widened our operating loss in the year ended December 31, 2012. This sensitivity analysis disregards the possibilities that rates can move in opposite directions and that losses from one geographic area may be offset by gains from another geographic area. Interest Rate Sensitivity In February 2012, we began investing in corporate debt securities. The primary objectives of our investment activities are the preservation of capital and supporting our liquidity requirements. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. Our investments are exposed to market risk due to a fluctuation in interest rates, which may affect our interest income and the fair market value of our investments. Due to the short-term nature of our investment portfolio, however, we do not believe an immediate 10% increase or decrease in interest rates would have a material effect on the fair market value of our portfolio. We therefore do not expect our operating results or cash flows to be materially affected by a sudden change in market interest rates.52",2023-12-30 18:26:54.071679

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes appearing at the end of this filing. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this filing, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. You should read the “Risk Factors” section of this filing for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results and the timing of certain events to differ materially from future results expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis. Overview ServiceNow is a leading provider of cloud-based services to automate and manage IT service relationships across the global enterprise. Our services include a suite of IT service automation applications built on our proprietary platform that can be rapidly deployed and configured. Customers use our services to create a single system of record for enterprise IT, automate manual tasks, standardize processes and consolidate legacy systems. Using ServiceNow, enterprise IT departments can accelerate their shift from the management of IT infrastructure to the management of IT service relationships across the enterprise with greater transparency, accountability and auditability. Our proprietary platform enables our customers to create custom applications and evolve the IT service model to service domains inside and outside the enterprise. We offer our services under a SaaS business model. Our subscription fees include access to the ordered subscription service and related support and include updates of the subscribed service during the subscription term. We provide a scaled pricing model based on the duration of the subscription term and we frequently extend discounts to our customers based on the number of users. We generate sales through our direct sales team and indirectly through channel partners and third-party referrals. We also generate revenues from professional services for implementation and training of customer personnel. We generally bill our customers annually in advance for subscription services and monthly in arrears for our professional services as the work is performed. Many customers initially subscribe to our services to solve a specific and immediate problem. Once that problem is solved, many of our customers deploy additional applications as they become more familiar with our services and apply them to new IT processes. In addition, many customers either repurpose our IT applications or build custom applications that automate various processes for business uses outside of IT such as human resources, facilities and quality control management. A majority of our revenues come from large global enterprise customers. We continue to invest in the development of our services, infrastructure and sales and marketing to drive long-term growth. We increased our overall employee headcount to 1,830 as of December 31, 2013 from 1,077 as of December 31, 2012. Fiscal Year End On February 3, 2012, our board of directors approved a change to our fiscal year-end from June 30 to December 31. Included in this filing is the transition period for the six months ended December 31, 2011. References to “fiscal 2011” and “fiscal 2010” refer to the fiscal years ended June 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Key Factors Affecting Our Performance Upsell rate. To grow our business it is important for us to generate additional sales from existing customers, which we refer to as our upsell rate. We calculate our upsell rate as the annual contract value of upsells signed during the period, net of any decreases in annual contract value of renewals during the period, divided by our total annual contract value signed during the period. The upsell rate was 31%, 30% and 29% for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively, and 28% and 25% for the six months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and 27% and 25% for fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010, respectively. Our upsells are primarily derived by an increase in the number of seat licenses purchased by our customers and are also derived from the addition of other subscription services. Renewal rate. We calculate our renewal rate by subtracting our attrition rate from 100%. Our attrition rate for a period is equal to the annual contract value from lost customers, divided by the total annual contract value from all customers that renewed during the period and from all lost customers. A lost customer is a customer that did not renew a contract expiring in the period and that, in our judgment, will not renew. Annual contract value is equal to the first 12 months of expected subscription revenues under a contract. Typically a customer that reduces its subscription upon renewal is not considered a lost customer. However, in instances where the subscription decrease represents the majority of the customer's annual contract value, we may deem the renewal as a lost customer. We believe our renewal rate is an important metric to measure the long-term value of customer agreements and our ability to retain our customers. Our renewal rate was 96%, 97% and 97% for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively, 97% and 99% for the six months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and 97% and 95% for fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010, respectively.29Total customers. We believe our total customer count is a key indicator of our market penetration, growth and future revenues. We have aggressively invested in, and intend to continue to invest in, our direct sales force and additional partnerships with our indirect sales channel. We generally define a customer as an entity with an active service contract as of the measurement date. In situations where there is a single contract that applies to entities with multiple subsidiaries or divisions, universities or governmental organizations, each entity that has contracted for a separate production instance of our services are counted as a separate customer. As of December 31, 2013 and 2012, our total customer count was 2,061 and 1,512, respectively.Investment in growth. We have invested, and intend to continue to invest in, expanding our operations, including increasing our headcount, expanding our cloud-based infrastructure, increasing access for our partners to utilize our tools and resources, and developing technology to support our growth. We have recently, and may in the future, also enter into acquisition transactions.Expansion beyond IT. Our customers can purchase access to our application suite for use outside of the IT department. Customers may also purchase access to our services to develop custom applications using our platform. Although in the near term we expect our revenue growth to be primarily driven by adoption and penetration of our suite of applications for use within IT, we continue to enhance the development capabilities within our platform, allowing custom application development to expand within our customer base. We believe the extensibility and simplicity of our platform is resulting in an increased use of our application suite outside of the IT department as well as an increase in customer application development. Components of Results of Operations Revenues Subscription revenues. Subscription revenues are primarily comprised of fees that give customers access to the ordered subscription service, related support and updates to the subscribed service during the subscription term. Pricing includes multiple instances, hosting and support services, data backup and disaster recovery services, as well as future upgrades, when and if available, offered during the subscription period. In addition, we offer three separately priced enabling technologies: Discovery, Orchestration and Performance Analytics. We typically invoice our customers for subscription fees in annual increments upon execution of the initial contract or subsequent renewal. Our average initial contract term was approximately 33 months for 2013. Our contracts are generally non-cancelable, though customers can terminate for breach if we materially fail to perform.We generate sales directly through our sales team and, to a lesser extent, through our channel partners. Sales to our channel partners are made at a discount and revenues are recorded at the discounted price when all revenue recognition criteria are met. From time to time, our channel partners also provide us referrals for which we pay a referral fee. We pay referral fees to channel partners and other third parties typically ranging from 2% to 34% of the first year’s annual contract value. These fees are included in sales and marketing expense. Professional services and other revenues. Professional services revenues consist of fees associated with the implementation and configuration of our subscription service.Our pricing for professional services are primarily on a time-and-materials basis. We generally invoice our professional services monthly in arrears based on actual hours and expenses incurred. Other revenues include primarily fees from customer training delivered on-site or publicly available classes, royalties from licensing training materials, attendance and sponsorship fees for our annual Knowledge user conference and other customer forums. Typical payment terms require our customers to pay us within 30 days of invoice. Refer to “Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates” below for further discussion of our revenue recognition accounting policy. Backlog. Backlog represents future amounts to be invoiced under our agreements and is not included in deferred revenue. As of December 31, 2013 and 2012, we had backlog of approximately $608.4 million and $379.0 million, respectively. We expect backlog will change from period to period for several reasons, including the timing and duration of customer subscription and professional services agreements, varying billing cycles of subscription agreements, and the timing of customer renewals.Allocation of Overhead Costs Overhead costs associated with facilities, IT and certain depreciation related to noncloud-based infrastructure are allocated to cost of revenues and operating expenses based on headcount. Depreciation related to our cloud-based infrastructure hardware equipment is classified as cost of subscription revenues. We anticipate overhead costs to increase in absolute dollars in 2014 due to growth in new geographic locations. During the year ended December 31, 2013, facilities expenses increased by $5.3 million compared to prior year, primarily due to expansion in our current headquarters and growth to new geographic locations. 30Cost of Revenues Cost of subscription revenues. Cost of subscription revenues consists primarily of expenses related to hosting our services and providing support to our customers. These expenses are comprised of data center capacity costs; personnel related costs directly associated with our cloud-based infrastructure and customer support, including salaries, benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation; and allocated overhead. Cost of professional services and other revenues. Cost of professional services and other revenues consists primarily of personnel related costs directly associated with our professional services and training departments, including salaries, benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation; the costs of contracted third-party vendors; and allocated overhead.Professional services associated with the implementation and configuration of our subscription services are performed directly by our services team, as well as by contracted third-party vendors. Fees paid to third-party vendors are primarily recognized as cost of revenues as the professional services are delivered. Cost of revenues associated with our professional services engagements contracted with third-party vendors as a percentage of professional services and other revenues was 17%, 26% and 55% for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively, 64% and 70% for the six months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, and 54% and 135% in fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010, respectively. Sales and Marketing Expenses Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel related expenses directly associated with our sales and marketing staff, including salaries, benefits, bonuses, commissions and stock-based compensation. Sales and marketing expenses also includes third-party referral fees, marketing and promotional events, including our annual Knowledge user conference, online marketing, product marketing and allocated overhead. Research and Development Expenses Research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel related expenses directly associated with our research and development staff, including salaries, benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation, and allocated overhead. General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel related expenses for our executive, finance, legal, human resources and administrative personnel, including salaries, benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation; external legal, accounting and other professional services fees; other corporate expenses; and allocated overhead. Provision for Income Taxes The provision for income taxes consists of federal, state and foreign income taxes. Due to cumulative losses, we maintain a valuation allowance against our U.S. deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2013 and 2012. We consider all available evidence, both positive and negative, including but not limited to, earnings history, projected future outcomes, industry and market trends and the nature of each of the deferred tax assets in assessing the extent to which a valuation allowance should be applied against our U.S. deferred tax assets.31Results of Operations To enhance comparability, the following table sets forth our results of operations for the periods presented.

Our upsell rate and renewal rate for the trailing twelve months ending December 31, 2013 were 31% and 96%, respectively, compared to 30% and 97%, respectively, for the trailing twelve months ending December 31, 2012. Total customer count at December 31, 2013 was 2,061 compared to 1,512 at December 31, 2012, an increase of 36%. Revenues from our direct sales organization and channel partners represented 88% and 12%, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012.Professional services and other revenues increased $35.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2013, compared to the prior year, due to an increase in the services provided to our growing customer base, increase in utilization and improvements in pricing of our professional services engagements. In addition, revenues from our annual Knowledge user conference increased to $5.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to $2.0 million in the prior year due to increased sponsorship and paid registrations.Our average total revenues per customer, defined as trailing four quarters' revenues divided by the average number of customers during the trailing four quarters, increased to approximately $230,000 for the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to approximately $190,000 for the year ended December 31, 2012. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2013, we expanded to several new markets primarily in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, or EMEA, and Asia Pacific and other regions.

Employee-related costs primarily consist of salaries and wages, benefits and travel. Hosting expenses decreased $1.8 million primarily due to the migration of customers from our managed service data centers to our co-location data centers. Our subscription gross profit percentage was 75% for the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to 69% for the prior year. We expect our subscription gross profit percentage to remain relatively flat for the year ended December 31, 2014.Cost of professional services and other revenues increased $26.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2013 as compared to the prior year primarily due to increased headcount resulting in an increase of $17.3 million in employee-related costs, an increase of $3.2 million in stock-based compensation, an increase of $2.1 million in overhead expenses, and an increase of $3.7 million in outside services costs.Our professional services and other gross profit (loss) percentage increased to 10% during the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to (4)% in the prior year due to improved scoping and pricing on customer engagements, better resource utilization and an increase in revenues from our annual Knowledge user conference which contributed six percentage points to the professional services and other gross profit percentage for the year ended December 31, 2013 and 2012. All related expenses from our annual Knowledge user conference are recorded in sales and marketing. We expect our gross profit percentage from professional services and other to remain relatively flat for the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily due to the anticipated increase in headcount in the professional services organization.

Commissions increased primarily due to growth in bookings and current year changes to our commission plans that place more emphasis on achieving quarterly targets and allow for participants in the plan to increase their compensation at a higher rate for exceeding their annual targets. Commissions and referral fees amounted to 10% and 8% of subscription revenues for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Marketing and event expenses increased $10.7 million, which included a $4.7 million increase in expenses related to our annual Knowledge user conference due to attendance more than doubling compared to the prior year. We expect sales and marketing expenses to increase for the year ended December 31, 2014 in terms of dollars and as a percentage of total revenues as we continue to expand our direct sales force, increase our marketing activities, grow our international operations, build brand awareness and sponsor additional marketing events.Research and Development Year Ended December 31 % Change 2013 2012 (dollars in thousands) Research and development$78,678 $39,333 100%Percentage of revenues18% 16% Headcount (at period end)352 200 76% Research and development expenses increased $39.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2013 as compared to the prior year, primarily due to increased headcount which resulted in an increase of $23.9 million in employee-related costs, an increase of $9.7 million in stock-based compensation, an increase of $4.0 million in overhead expenses and an increase of $1.5 million in outside services related to increase use of consultants. 35 We expect research and development expenses to increase for the year ended December 31, 2014 in absolute dollar terms and as a percentage of total revenues as we continue to improve the existing functionality of our services, develop new applications to fill market needs and continue to enhance our core platform.

Outside services increased $2.9 million primarily due to our international expansion and the acquisition of Mirror42 Holding B.V. The increase is also related to costs associated with our first full year of being a public company.We expect general and administrative expenses to increase for the year ended December 31, 2014, in absolute dollar terms, but to remain flat as a percentage of total revenues as we continue to grow.

We had a foreign currency transaction loss of $2.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 as compared to a gain of $1.1 million for the prior year, primarily due to the strengthening of the Euro against other major currencies and an increase in our foreign operations. The decrease was partially offset by an increase of $0.7 million in interest income due to the higher investment balances during the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to the prior year. During 2014, we expect to incur approximately $29.1 million in amortization expense of debt discount and issuance costs related to the Notes. Our expanding international operations will continue to increase our exposure to currency risks, though we cannot presently predict the impact of this exposure on our consolidated financial statements.While we have not engaged in the hedging of our foreign currency transactions to date, we are presently evaluating the costs and benefits of initiating such a program and may hedge selected significant transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar in the future.

Our tax expense increased $1.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2013 as compared to the prior year due to a higher proportion of earnings in foreign jurisdictions with high statutory tax rates, a higher loss from U.S. operations, the tax effect of acquired companies, and the issuance of the Notes. See Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements for our reconciliation of income taxes at the statutory federal rate to the provision for income taxes.We continue to maintain a full valuation allowance on our federal and state deferred tax assets and the significant components of the tax expense recorded are current cash taxes in various jurisdictions. The cash tax expenses are impacted by each jurisdiction’s individual tax rates, laws on timing of recognition of income and deductions, and availability of net operating losses and tax credits. Given the full valuation allowance, sensitivity of current cash taxes to local rules and our foreign structuring, we expect our effective tax rate could fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis and could be adversely affected to the extent earnings are lower than anticipated in countries that have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher statutory rates. We consider the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the United States.

Of the total increase in subscription revenues, 34% represented revenues from new customers acquired after December 31, 2011, and 66% represented revenues from existing customers at or prior to December 31, 2011. Our total customers increased 55% to 1,512 at December 31, 2012 from 974 at December 31, 2011. The average total revenues per customer, defined as revenue during the trailing four quarters divided by the average number of customers during the trailing four quarters, increased to approximately $190,000 from approximately $157,000 over this period primarily due to an increase in the number of subscriptions sold to existing customers and an increase in average new customer deal size. Of the $93.6 million total increase in subscription revenues for the year ended December 31, 2012, 86% represented sales to customers by our direct sales organization and 14% represented revenues from channel partners. Subscription revenues in North America represented 68% of the $93.6 million total increase in subscription revenues and 32% represented subscription revenues outside North America. During the year ended December 31, 2012, we continued to increase our focus on international markets through the addition of new channel partners, the expansion of our direct sales organization and the opening of additional sales and marketing offices in Sweden and Israel. The increase in professional services and other revenues of $22.0 million was primarily due to an increase in the services provided to our growing customer base in addition to a shift in our pricing model to a time-and-materials basis. We had an increase in revenues of $3.4 million associated with acceptances received in 2012 and an increase of $0.9 million associated with our Knowledge conference, held in May 2012. Revenues in North America represented 71% of the $22.0 million total increase in professional services and other revenues.

Personnel-related expenses increased $18.6 million, consisting primarily of increased employee compensation, benefits and travel expenses of $15.5 million and additional stock-based compensation of $2.9 million. Overhead expenses increased $1.7 million. Growth in personnel-related and overhead expenses was driven by headcount growth and investments in our cloud infrastructure and support organizations. Hosting expenses related to our network infrastructure increased $6.9 million as we increased data center capacity to migrate customers from our managed service data centers to our co-location data centers and to support our customer growth. We also opened six new data centers since December 31, 2011. In the fourth quarter of 2012, we completed the transition of all our managed services data centers to our co-location data centers. Depreciation expense related to our equipment in our data centers increased $8.3 million, of which $6.6 million is due to purchases of network infrastructure to support our new data centers and growth within our existing data centers and $1.7 million is due to the accelerated depreciation of the assets located in our managed services data centers. Depreciation expense related to our managed services data centers for the year ended December 31, 2012 was $3.1 million. Additionally, outside services primarily related to enhancements to our data center security and the migration of our customers increased $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. Cost of professional services and other revenues increased $18.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2012 as compared to prior year. The overall increase was primarily attributable to increased personnel-related expenses of $15.5 million, consisting primarily of increased employee compensation, benefits and travel expenses of $13.8 million and additional stock-based compensation of $1.3 million, driven by headcount growth and an increase in our stock price. Overhead expenses increased $1.1 million also due to headcount growth. In addition, outside services expenses increased $1.8 million primarily due to an increase in implementation services as a result of our increased sales volume.Our professional services and other gross profit (loss) percentage improved from (30)% during the year ended December 31, 2011 to (4)% during the year ended December 31, 2012. The improved gross profit percentage was primarily attributable to a shift in our pricing model to a time-and-materials basis and an increased focus on scoping projects and managing resource utilization. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2012, the amount of work we sub-contracted to our partners decreased as a percentage of total professional services and other revenues compared to prior year. Professional services and other revenues include $2.0 million and $1.1 million for our Knowledge conference, for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Revenues from our Knowledge conference contributed six percentage points and nine percentage points to the professional services and other gross profit percentage for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Expenses associated with the conference are included in sales and marketing expense.

Total headcount in sales and marketing increased 45% from December 31, 2011 to December 31, 2012, contributing to a $34.1 million increase in personnel-related expenses, consisting primarily of increased employee compensation, benefits and travel expenses associated with our marketing team and direct sales force of $25.5 million and additional stock-based compensation of $7.6 million. The increase is also due to increased overhead expenses of $2.3 million due to increased headcount. In addition, we incurred an increase of $4.8 million in marketing and event expenses primarily attributable to our Knowledge conference, which experienced a 102% increase in attendance year-over-year. Commissions increased $9.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2011, which was directly attributable to increased revenues and changes made to our commission plans. Commissions and referral fees amounted to 8% and 7% of subscription revenues in 2012 and 2011, respectively. These fees are deferred and amortized on a straight-line basis over the non-cancelable terms of the related customer contracts.

Professional and outside service expenses increased $2.7 million, comprised primarily of accounting fees related to our external audit and tax consulting fees associated with our international expansion. Expenses from third-party software and service license agreements increased $1.5 million due to the implementation of additional systems to support the growth of our business. In August 2012, we relocated our San Diego, California office to another facility in the same city. As part of this move, we incurred $2.5 million in lease abandonment costs, which included a loss on disposal of our leasehold improvements and furniture and fixtures and a cease-use loss.

We continue to maintain a full valuation allowance on our federal and state deferred tax assets, and the significant components of the tax expense recorded are current cash taxes in various jurisdictions. The cash tax expenses are impacted by each jurisdiction’s individual tax rates, laws on timing of recognition of income and deductions and availability of net operating losses and tax credits. In December 2011, we reorganized our international operations and established our non-U.S. headquarters in the Netherlands, which has an effective tax rate that is lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate. Given the full valuation allowance, sensitivity of current cash taxes to local rules and our foreign restructuring, we expect our effective tax rate could fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis and could be adversely affected to the extent earnings are lower than anticipated in countries that have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher statutory rates. The earnings of our foreign subsidiaries are considered to be permanently reinvested outside of the United States.

Our total customers increased 62% from December 31, 2010 to December 31, 2011. The average subscription revenues per customer increased 19% over this period primarily due to an increase in the number of subscriptions sold to existing customers. 40Of the $31.7 million total increase in subscription revenues for the six months ended December 31, 2011, 81% represented sales to customers by our direct sales organization and 19% represented revenues from channel partners. Subscription revenues in North America represented 67% of the $31.7 million total increase in subscription revenues and 33% represented subscription revenues outside North America. The increase in revenues from channel partners was due primarily to increased market adoption of our subscription service through sales by our existing channel partners and to a lesser extent the addition of new channel partners. The increase in subscription revenues outside North America was due primarily to increased adoption of our subscription service through sales by our existing channel partners and direct sales organization, and to a lesser extent the addition of new channel partners and the expansion of our direct sales organization. During the six months ended December 31, 2011, we opened additional sales and marketing offices in Denmark and France, which did not account for a significant portion of increased revenues during the period. The increase in professional services and other revenues of $3.7 million was primarily due to the growth in our customer base. Revenues in North America represented 73% of the $3.7 million total increase in professional services and other revenues. Revenues outside North America represented the remaining 27%.

The increase in personnel-related expenses was driven by headcount growth. In addition, hosting fees for our network infrastructure increased $1.6 million as we increased data center capacity to support our growth. At December 31, 2011, we delivered our services from six data centers in North America and seven data centers internationally, compared to three data centers in North America and five data centers internationally at December 31, 2010.

Subscription revenues in North America represented 75% of the $39.1 million total increase in subscription revenues and 25% represented subscription revenues outside North America. The increase in professional services and other revenues of $10.2 million was primarily due to the prospective adoption of new revenue accounting guidance resulting in an increase to professional services and other revenues of $5.5 million in fiscal 2011.

These personnel-related expenses increases were driven by headcount. In addition, hosting fees for our network infrastructure increased $2.1 million as we increased data center capacity to support our growth. At June 30, 2011, we delivered our services from six data centers in North America and five data centers internationally compared to three data centers in the United States and five data centers internationally at June 30, 2010. Depreciation expense also increased $0.8 million as we started the transition of our network infrastructure from a managed service hosting model to a co-location model. Our subscription gross profit percentage decreased from 84% to 81% from fiscal 2010 to fiscal 2011 primarily due to these increased expenses. Cost of professional services and other revenues increased $6.5 million during fiscal 2011 as compared to the same period in the prior year. The overall increase in cost of professional services and other revenues was primarily attributed to increased employee compensation, benefits and travel expenses of $3.1 million driven by headcount growth. In addition, outside services expenses increased $3.1 million primarily due to additional fees paid to third parties to provide implementation services. 44Our professional services and other gross profit percentage improved from (202)% to (21)% from fiscal 2010 to fiscal 2011, primarily due to increased revenues as a result of the prospective adoption of new revenue recognition accounting guidance.

The cash tax expenses are impacted by each jurisdiction’s individual tax rates, laws on timing of recognition of income and deductions and availability of net operating losses and tax credits. Given the full valuation allowance and sensitivity of current cash taxes to local rules, our effective tax rate fluctuates significantly on an annual basis and could be adversely affected to the extent earnings are lower than anticipated in countries that have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher statutory rates. Quarterly Results of Operations The following table set forth our quarterly consolidated statements of operations. We have prepared the quarterly data on a consistent basis with the audited consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In the opinion of management, the financial information reflects all necessary adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair statement of this data. This information should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The results of historical periods are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for a full year or any future period.46 For the Three Months Ended Dec 30,2013 Sep 30,2013 June 30,2013 March 31,2013 Dec 30,2012 Sep 30,2012 June 30,2012 March 31,2012 (in thousands, except per share data)Revenues: Subscription$104,878 $92,992 $80,376 $71,558 $62,886 $55,279 $46,820 $39,541Professional services and other20,352 18,267 21,846 14,381 12,276 9,066 9,954 7,890Total revenues125,230 111,259 102,222 85,939 75,162 64,345 56,774 47,431Cost of revenues(1): Subscription25,968 23,429 20,219 18,312 20,076 17,931 14,239 11,012Professional services and other19,410 18,146 15,779 13,996 12,232 9,643 8,652 10,224Total cost of revenues45,378 41,575 35,998 32,308 32,308 27,574 22,891 21,236Gross profit79,852 69,684 66,224 53,631 42,854 36,771 33,883 26,195Operating expenses: Sales and marketing57,337 47,336 52,291 38,226 29,481 28,140 26,909 19,307Research and development23,869 20,819 17,951 16,039 13,235 10,783 9,272 6,043General and administrative18,007 16,179 15,325 12,279 9,676 11,195 6,819 6,427Total operating expenses99,213 84,334 85,567 66,544 52,392 50,118 43,000 31,777Income (loss) from operations(19,361) (14,650) (19,343) (12,913) (9,538) (13,347) (9,117) (5,582)Interest and other income (expense), net(4,326) 600 (1,323) 119 456 615 41 492Income (loss) before provision for income taxes(23,687) (14,050) (20,666) (12,794) (9,082) (12,732) (9,076) (5,090)Provision for income taxes545 663 739 564 849 321 (352) 550Net income (loss)$(24,232) $(14,713) $(21,405) $(13,358) $(9,931) $(13,053) $(8,724) $(5,640)Net income (loss) per share attributable to common stockholders - Basic$(24,232) $14,713 $21,405 $(13,358) $(9,931) $(13,053) $(8,878) $(5,794)Net income (loss) per share attributable to common stockholders - Diluted$(24,232) $14,713 $21,405 $(13,358) $(9,931) $(13,053) $(8,878) $(5,794) Basic$(0.17) $(0.11) $(0.16) $(0.10) $(0.08) $(0.11) $(0.32) $(0.23) Diluted$(0.17) $(0.11) $(0.16) $(0.10) $(0.08) $(0.11) $(0.32) $(0.23)Seasonality, Cyclicality and Quarterly Trends We have historically experienced seasonality in terms of when we enter into customer agreements for our services. We sign a significantly higher percentage of agreements with new customers, as well as renewal agreements with existing customers, in the quarter ended December 31. The increase in customer agreements for the quarter ended December 31 is primarily a result of the terms of our commission plans to incentivize our direct sales force to meet their quotas by December 31 and large enterprise account buying patterns typical in the software industry. Furthermore, we usually sign a significant portion of these agreements during the last month, and often the last two weeks, of each quarter. This seasonality is reflected to a much lesser extent, and sometimes is not immediately apparent, in our revenues, due to the fact that we recognize subscription revenues over the term of the license agreement, which is generally 12 to 36 months. Although these seasonal factors are common in the technology industry, historical patterns should not be considered a reliable indicator of our future sales activity or performance. Our revenues have increased over the periods presented due to increased sales to new customers, as well as upsells to existing customers. Our operating expenses have increased sequentially every quarter primarily due to increases in headcount and other related expenses to support our growth. We anticipate these expenses will continue to increase in future periods as we continue to focus on investing in the long-term growth of our business.47 Liquidity and Capital Resources Year Ended December 31, Six Months EndedDecember 31, Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2013 2012 2011 2011 2010 2011 2010 (dollars in thousands)Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities$81,746$48,766 $39,977 $13,220$10,711 $37,468$(7,532)Net cash used in investing activities(402,795)(239,149) (14,485) (7,959)(1,857) (8,383)(1,455)Net cash provided by financing activities568,570241,839 3,159 2,154222 1,22730,672Net increase in cash and cash equivalents, net of impact of exchange rates on cash247,31450,901 29,631 8,2359,055 30,45121,614 Our principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents, investments, and cash generated from operations. As of December 31, 2013, we had $634.6 million in cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, of which $33.4 million represented cash located overseas. In addition, we had $255.4 million in long-term investments which provide additional capital resources.In November 2013, we issued $575.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the Notes and concurrently entered into a hedge (the ""Note Hedge"") and warrant transaction (the ""Warrants""). The net proceeds of this debt issuance will be used for general corporate purposes, including potential acquisitions and strategic transactions. The Warrants are exercisable at a strike price of $107.46 per share. Upon conversion of the Notes, we may choose to pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock. As of December 31, 2013, the Notes were not convertible. We anticipate our current cash and cash equivalents balance and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs including the expansion of data centers, lease obligations, expenditures related to the growth of our headcount and the acquisition of fixed assets and investments in office facilities to accommodate our growth for at least the next 12 months. Whether these resources are adequate to meet our liquidity needs beyond that period will depend on our growth, operating results and the capital expenditures required to meet possible increased demand for our services. If we require additional capital resources to grow our business at any time in the future, we may seek to finance our operations from the current funds available or seek additional equity or debt financing. Operating Activities Cash provided by operating activities mainly consists of net income adjusted for certain non-cash items, including depreciation and amortization, amortization of issuance cost and debt discount, stock-based compensation, tax benefits from employee stock plans and changes in operating assets and liabilities during the year.Net cash provided by operating activities was $81.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to $48.8 million for the prior year. The increase in operating cash flow was primarily due to the increased net income after adjusting for the non-cash activities and favorable impacts of changes in operating assets and liabilities. Net cash flow from the aggregate of changes in accounts receivable, deferred commissions and deferred revenue increased due to increased sales for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase was offset by a decrease in net cash flows from the aggregate of changes in accrued liabilities, accounts payable and prepaid expenses due to the growth of our business and increased headcount of 70% for the year ended December 31, 2013.Net cash provided by operating activities was $48.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to $40.0 million for the prior year. The increase in operating cash flow was primarily due to the increased net incomes after adjusting for the non-cash activities and favorable impacts of change in operating assets and liabilities. Net cash flow from accounts receivable, deferred commissions and deferred revenue increased due to increased sales for the year ended December 31, 2012. The increase was offset by decrease in net cash flows from accrued liabilities, accounts payable and prepaid expenses due to growth of our business and increased headcount of 79% for the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to the prior year. 48Net cash provided by operating activities was $13.2 million for the six months ended December 31, 2011 compared to $10.7 million for the six months ended December 31, 2010. The increase in operating cash flow was primarily due to the increased net incomes after adjusting for the non-cash activities and favorable impacts of change in operating assets and liabilities. Net cash flow from accounts receivable, deferred commissions and deferred revenue increased due to increased sales. Our sales and marketing headcount increased 73% during the six months ended December 31, 2011 compared to the prior period. The increase in accrued liabilities was primarily driven by the growth in our business and increased headcount.Net cash provided by operating activities was $37.5 million for fiscal 2011 compared to $7.5 million for fiscal 2010. The increase in operating cash flow was primarily due to the increased net incomes driven by the growth of our business. Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2013 was $402.8 million compared to $239.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. The increase in cash used in investing activities was mainly due to increases in the net purchases of investments of $136.8 million and capital expenditures of $13.3 million related to the purchase of cloud-based infrastructure hardware equipment to support the expansion of our data centers as well as investments in leasehold improvements, furniture and equipment to support our headcount growth. Additionally, in 2013 we paid $13.3 million for the acquisition of Mirror42 Holding B.V.Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2012 was $239.1 million compared to $14.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. The increase in cash used in investing activities was mainly due the increases in the net purchases of investments of $197.1 million and capital expenditures of $27.4 million related to the purchase of cloud-based infrastructure hardware equipment to support the expansion of our data centers as well as investments in leasehold improvements, furniture and equipment to support our headcount growth.Net cash used in investing activities for the six months ended December 31, 2011 was $8.0 million compared to $1.9 million for the six months ended December 31, 2010. The increase in cash used in investing activities was mainly due to increase in capital expenditures of $5.9 million related to the purchase of cloud-based infrastructure hardware equipment to support the expansion of our data centers as well as investments in leasehold improvements, furniture and equipment to support our headcount growth.In fiscal 2011 and 2010, our investing activities primarily consisted of capital expenditures related to the purchase of cloud-based infrastructure hardware equipment to support the expansion of our data centers as well as investments in leasehold improvements and furniture and equipment to support our headcount growth. Financing Activities Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2013 was $568.6 million compared to $241.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. The increase in cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to net proceeds of $511.7 million from issuance of the Notes and Warrants and purchase of the Note Hedge, and $38.8 million increase in proceeds from exercise of employee stock options and $13.2 million proceeds from our Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or ESPP. For the year ended December 31, 2012, we received $169.8 million net proceeds from our IPO, $50.6 million net proceeds from our follow-on offering, and $17.8 million net proceeds from the issuance of common stock. Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2012 was $241.8 million compared to $3.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. The increase in cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to net proceeds from IPO of $169.8 million, net proceeds from our follow-on offering of $50.6 million, $17.8 million in gross proceeds from the issuance of common stock through a private placement with a new stockholder $1.6 million increase in tax benefits from employee stock plan, partially offset by our purchases of common stock and restricted stock from stockholders of $2.0 million.Net cash provided by financing activities for the six months ended December 31, 2011 was $2.2 million compared to $0.2 million for the six months ended December 31, 2010. The increase in cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to $2.0 million increase in proceeds from employee stock options.Net cash provided by financing activities for fiscal 2011 was $1.2 million compared to $30.7 million for fiscal year 2010. The decrease in cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to the sale and issuance of Series D preferred stock of $51.2 million in fiscal 2010, $21.0 million of which was used to repurchase and subsequently cancel shares of common stock from eligible stockholders and warrants to purchase Series B preferred stock from a warrant holder.Contractual Obligations and Commitments 49Contractual obligations represent future cash commitments and liabilities under agreements with third parties, and exclude orders for goods and services entered into in the normal course of business that are not enforceable or legally binding. The following table represents our known contractual obligations as of December 31, 2013, aggregated by type: Payments Due by PeriodContractual ObligationsTotal LessThan1 Year 1 – 3Years 3 – 5Years MoreThan5 Years (in thousands)Operating leases: Data centers(1)$21,603 $9,797 $9,820 $1,306 $680Facilities space(2)117,965 10,314 27,851 28,530 51,270Convertible Senior Notes575,000 — — 575,000 —Total operating leases$714,568 $20,111 $37,671 $604,836 $51,950 (1)Operating leases for data centers represent our principal commitment for co-location facilities for data center capacity.(2)Operating leases for facilities space represents our principal commitments, which consists of obligations under office space leases. Lease commitments of $8.4 million related to the lease for our former San Diego office are also included in the table above. In addition to the obligations in the table above, approximately $0.9 million of unrecognized tax benefits have been recorded as liabilities as of December 31, 2013. It is uncertain as to if or when such amounts may be settled. We have also recorded a liability for potential penalties of $0.3 million and interest of $0.1 million related to these unrecognized tax benefits.Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements During all periods presented, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. As such, we are not exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in those types of relationships. Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates Our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. These items are monitored and analyzed by us for changes in facts and circumstances, and material changes in these estimates could occur in the future. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Changes in estimates are reflected in reported results for the period in which they become known. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. While our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements, we believe that the following accounting policies are critical to the process of making significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our audited consolidated financial statements. Revenue RecognitionWe derive our revenues from two sources: (i) subscriptions and (ii) professional services and other. Subscription revenues are primarily comprised of subscription fees that give customers access to the ordered subscription service, related support and updates to the subscribed service during the subscription term. Our contracts typically do not give the customer the right to take possession of the software supporting the services. Professional services and other revenues consist of fees associated with the implementation and configuration of our services. Professional services and other revenues also include customer training and attendance and sponsorship fees for Knowledge, our annual user conference.50We commence revenue recognition when all of the following conditions are met: •There is persuasive evidence of an arrangement;•The service has been provided to the customer;•The collection of related fees is reasonably assured; and•The amount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable.We use a signed contract together with a signed order form or a purchase order as evidence of an arrangement for a new customer. In subsequent transactions with an existing customer, including an upsell or a renewal, we consider the existing signed contract and either the new signed order form or new purchase order as evidence of an arrangement. We recognize subscription revenues ratably over the contract term beginning on the commencement date of each contract, the date we make our services available to our customers. Once our services are available to customers, we record amounts due in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue. We price professional services primarily on a time-and-materials basis and recognize professional services revenues as the services are delivered using a proportional performance model. Such services are delivered over a short period of time. In instances where final acceptance of the services are required before revenues are recognized, we defer professional services revenues and the associated costs until all acceptance criteria have been met. We assess collectibility based on a number of factors such as past collection history with the customer and creditworthiness of the customer. If we determine collectibility is not reasonably assured, we defer revenue recognition until collectibility becomes reasonably assured. We assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment. Our arrangements do not include general rights of return. We have multiple element arrangements comprised of subscription fees and professional services. In October 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, ratified authoritative accounting guidance regarding revenue recognition for arrangements with multiple deliverables effective for fiscal periods beginning on or after June 15, 2010. As a result, this guidance was applied to all revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified since July 1, 2010. For fiscal 2011, total revenues increased $6.4 million and deferred revenue decreased $6.4 million due to adoption of the new guidance. Upon adoption of this authoritative accounting guidance, we began to account for subscription and professional services revenues as separate units of accounting. To qualify as a separate unit of accounting, the delivered item must have value to the customer on a standalone basis. We have concluded that our subscription service has standalone value as it is routinely sold separately by us. In addition, the applications offered through this subscription service are fully functional without any additional development, modification or customization. We provide customers access to our subscription service at the beginning of the contract term. In determining whether professional services have standalone value, we considered the following factors for each professional services agreement: availability of the services from other vendors, the nature of the professional services, the timing of when the professional services contract was signed in comparison to the subscription service start date and the contractual dependence of the subscription service on the customer’s satisfaction with the professional services work. Our professional services, including implementation and configuration services, are not so unique and complex that other vendors cannot provide them. In some instances, customers independently contract with third-party vendors to do the implementation and we regularly outsource implementation services to contracted third-party vendors. As a result, we concluded professional services, including implementation and configuration services, have standalone value. We determine the selling price of each deliverable in the arrangement using the selling price hierarchy. Under the selling price hierarchy, the selling price for each deliverable is determined using vendor-specific objective evidence, or VSOE, of selling price or third-party evidence, or TPE, of selling price if VSOE does not exist. If neither VSOE nor TPE of selling price exists for a deliverable, the selling price is determined using the best estimate of selling price, or BESP. The selling price for each unit of accounting is based on the BESP since VSOE and TPE are not available for our subscription service or professional services and other. The BESP for each deliverable is determined primarily by considering the historical selling price of these deliverables in similar transactions as well as other factors, including, but not limited to, market competition, review of stand-alone sales and current pricing practices. In determining the appropriate pricing structure, we consider the extent of competitive pricing of similar products and marketing analysis. The total arrangement fee for these multiple element arrangements is then allocated to the separate units of accounting based on the relative selling price. The BESP for our subscription service is based upon the historical selling price of these deliverables. In limited circumstances, we grant certain customers the right to deploy our subscription service on the customers’ own servers without significant penalty. These arrangements are subject to software revenue recognition guidance since the customer deploys our software. We have analyzed all of the elements in these particular multiple element arrangements and determined that we do not have sufficient VSOE of fair value to allocate revenue to our subscription service and professional services. Consequently, we defer all revenue and related costs under the arrangement until the last element in the transaction has been delivered or started 51to be delivered. Once the subscription service and the professional services have commenced, we recognize the entire fee and related costs from the arrangement ratably over the remaining period of the arrangement. Deferred Revenue Deferred revenue consists primarily of payments received in advance of revenue recognition for our subscriptions and professional services and other revenues and is recognized as the revenue recognition criteria are met. We generally invoice our customers in annual installments for our subscription service. Accordingly, the deferred revenue balance does not represent the total contract value of annual or multi-year subscription license agreements. Deferred revenue that will be recognized during the succeeding 12-month period is recorded as current portion of deferred revenue and the remaining portion is recorded as long-term.Deferred Commissions Deferred commissions are the incremental selling costs that are directly associated with our non-cancelable subscription contracts with customers and consist of sales commissions paid to our direct sales force and referral fees paid to independent third-parties. The majority of commissions and referral fees are deferred and amortized on a straight-line basis over the non-cancelable terms of the related customer contracts. We include amortization of deferred commissions in sales and marketing expense in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss).Goodwill, Intangible Assets and Other Long Lived AssetsGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price in a business combination over the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired. We evaluate and test the recoverability of goodwill for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if circumstances indicate that goodwill may not be recoverable.Intangible assets are amortized over their useful lives ranging from 18 months to six years. Each period we evaluate the estimated remaining useful life of purchased intangible assets to determine whether events or changes in circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization. We periodically review the carrying amounts of these assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable. We measure the recoverability of these assets by comparing the carrying amount of each asset to the future undiscounted cash flows we expect the asset to generate. If we consider any of these assets to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized equals the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair market value. Stock-based Compensation We recognize compensation expense related to stock options and restricted stock units, or RSUs, on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting term of four years. We recognize compensation expense related to shares issued pursuant to the ESPP, on a straight-line basis over the offering period. We recognize compensation expense net of estimated forfeiture activity. We estimate the fair value of options using the Black-Scholes options pricing model and fair value of RSU awards using the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant. Income Taxes We use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes, in which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. We measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be reversed. We recognize the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates as income and expense in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is established if it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. Our tax positions are subject to income tax audits by multiple tax jurisdictions throughout the world. We recognize the tax benefit of an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not the position is sustainable upon examination by the taxing authority, based on the technical merits. We measure the tax benefit recognized as the largest amount of benefit which is more likely than not to be realized upon settlement with the taxing authority. We recognize interest accrued and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in our tax provision.We calculate the current and deferred income tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed in subsequent years and record adjustments based on filed income tax returns 52when identified. The amount of income taxes paid is subject to examination by U.S. federal, state and foreign tax authorities. The estimate of the potential outcome of any uncertain tax issue is subject to management’s assessment of relevant risks, facts and circumstances existing at that time. To the extent the assessment of such tax position changes, we record the change in estimate in the period in which we make the determination. Recent Accounting PronouncementsIn July 2013, the FASB issued an accounting standard update that provides explicit guidance on the financial statement presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss carryforward or a tax credit carryforward exists. Under the new standard update, unrecognized tax benefit, or a portion of an unrecognized tax benefit, is to be presented in the financial statements as a reduction to a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss carryforward or a tax credit carryforward. The new guidance becomes effective for us on January 1, 2014 and it should be applied prospectively to unrecognized tax benefits that exist at the effective date with retrospective application permitted. We determined the impact of this new guidance is not material to the consolidated financial statements.ITEM 7A.QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Foreign Currency Exchange Risk We have foreign currency risks related to our revenue and operating expenses denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, primarily the Euro and British Pound Sterling. Revenues outside of North America as a percentage of revenue was 30%, 29% and 27% during the year ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively, 29% and 26% during the six months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and 25% and 28% in fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010, respectively. Changes in exchange rates may negatively affect our revenue and other operating results as expressed in U.S. dollars. We have experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income (loss) as a result of transaction gains or losses related to revaluing certain current asset and current liability balances that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entities in which they are recorded. For the most part, we are unable to accurately forecast the changes in exchange rates and consequent gains and losses from such fluctuations. We recognized foreign currency net losses of $2.5 million, $1.3 million, $0.6 million and $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 and 2011, fiscal 2011 and the six months ended December 31, 2010, respectively. We recognized foreign currency net gains of $1.1 million, $1.6 million and $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, the six months ended December 31, 2011 and fiscal 2010, respectively. While we have not engaged in the hedging of our foreign currency transactions to date, we may in the future hedge selected significant transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.We estimate that a decline in the value of the U.S. dollar as measured against the other currencies in which our transactions are denominated would have widened our operating loss in the year ended December 31, 2013. A hypothetical 10% decrease in the U.S. dollar against other currencies would result in an approximate $0.3 million increase in operating loss for the year ended December 31, 2013. This analysis disregards the possibilities that rates can move in opposite directions and that losses from one geographic area may be offset by gains from another geographic area. Interest Rate Sensitivity In February 2012, we began investing in corporate debt securities. The primary objectives of our investment activities are the preservation of capital and support of our liquidity requirements. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. Our investments are exposed to market risk due to a fluctuation in interest rates, which may affect our interest income and the fair market value of our investments. As of December 31, 2013, a hypothetical 50 basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate $2.6 million decline of the fair value of our available-for-sale securities. This estimate is based on a sensitivity model that measures market value changes when changes in interest rates occur.Market RiskIn November 2013, we issued Notes with aggregate principal amount of $575.0 million. We carry this instrument at face value less unamortized discount on our balance sheet. Because this instrument does not bear interest, we have no financial statement risk associated with changes in interest rates.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes appearing under ""Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data"" in Item 8 of this filing. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this filing, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. You should carefully read the “Forward Looking Statements"" and ""Risk Factors” sections of this filing for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results and the timing of certain events to differ materially from future results expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis. Overview ServiceNow is a leading provider of cloud-based solutions that define, structure, manage and automate services across the global enterprise. By applying a service-oriented lens to the activities, tasks and processes that comprise day-to-day work life, we help the modern enterprise operate faster and be more scalable than ever before. We offer our services on an annual subscription fee basis which includes access to the ordered subscription service and related support including updates to the subscribed service during the subscription term. We provide a scaled pricing model based on the duration of the subscription term and we frequently extend discounts to our customers based on the number of users. We generate sales through our direct sales team and indirectly through channel partners and third-party referrals. We also generate revenues from professional services for implementation and training of customer personnel. We generally bill our customers annually in advance for subscription services and monthly in arrears for our professional services as the work is performed. A majority of our revenues come from large global enterprise customers. We continue to invest in the development of our services, infrastructure and sales and marketing to drive long-term growth. We increased our overall employee headcount to 2,826 as of December 31, 2014 from 1,830 as of December 31, 2013. Key Factors Affecting Our Performance Upsell rate. To grow our business it is important for us to generate additional sales from existing customers, which we refer to as our upsell rate. We calculate our upsell rate as the annualized contract value, or ACV, of upsells, net of losses during the period, divided by our total ACV signed during the period. The upsell rate was 36%, 31% and 30% for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Our upsells are primarily derived by an increase in the number of seat licenses purchased by our customers and are also derived from the addition of other subscription services. Renewal rate. We calculate our renewal rate by subtracting our attrition rate from 100%. Our attrition rate for a period is equal to the ACV from lost customers, divided by the total ACV from all customers that renewed during the period and from all lost customers. A lost customer is a customer that did not renew a contract expiring in the period and that, in our judgment, will not renew. Typically a customer that reduces its subscription upon renewal is not considered a lost customer. However, in instances where the subscription decrease represents the majority of the customer's ACV, we may deem the renewal as a lost customer. Our renewal rate was 97%, 96% and 97% for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.Total customers. We believe our total customer count is a key indicator of our market penetration, growth and future revenues. We have aggressively invested in, and intend to continue to invest in, our direct sales force and additional partnerships with our indirect sales channel. We generally define a customer as an entity with an active subscription contract as of the measurement date. In situations where there is a single contract that applies to entities with multiple subsidiaries or divisions, universities or governmental organizations, each entity that has contracted for a separate production instance of our services are counted as a separate customer. As of December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, our total customer count was 2,725, 2,061 and 1,512, respectively. Our customer count excludes customers of our Express product offering, which is our recently launched standardized IT service management solution. Number of customers with ACV greater than $1 million. We count the total number of customers with ACV greater than $1 million as of the end of the period. We had 129, 67 and 37 customers with ACV greater than $1 million as of December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.30G2K customer count. The Global 2000 (""G2K"") customer count is defined as the total number of G2K companies in our customer base as of the end of the period. The Forbes Global 2000 is an annual ranking of the top 2000 public companies in the world by Forbes magazine. The ranking is based on a mix of four metrics: sales, profit, assets, and market value. The Forbes list is updated annually in the second quarter of the calendar year. Current and prior period G2K customer counts are based on the most recent list for comparability purposes. We adjust the G2K count for acquisitions, spin-offs, and other market activity to ensure the G2K customer count is accurately captured. For example, when a G2K company that is not our customer acquires a company in our existing customer base that is not a G2K company, a new G2K customer will be added in the quarter the acquisition occurs. When we enter into a contract with a G2K parent company, or any of its related subsidiaries, or any combination of entities within a G2K company, only one G2K customer will be counted. Further penetration into entities within the G2K customer is not counted as a new customer in the G2K customer count. Our G2K customer count was 522, 400 and 265 as of December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Components of Results of Operations Revenues Subscription revenues. Subscription revenues are primarily comprised of fees that give customers access to the ordered subscription service, related support and updates to the subscribed service during the subscription term. Pricing includes multiple instances, hosting and support services, data backup and disaster recovery services, as well as future upgrades, when and if available, offered during the subscription period. We typically invoice our customers for subscription fees in annual increments upon execution of the initial contract or subsequent renewal. Our contract is generally non-cancelable during the subscription term, though a customer can terminate for breach if we materially fail to perform. We generate sales directly through our sales team and, to a lesser extent, through our channel partners. Sales to our channel partners are made at a discount and revenues are recorded at the discounted price when all revenue recognition criteria are met. From time to time, our channel partners also provide us referrals for which we pay a referral fee. We pay referral fees to channel partners and other third parties, which is typically 15% of the customer's ACV. The referral fees paid could vary depending on the level of activity the partner performs in the sales process. These fees are included in sales and marketing expense. Professional services and other revenues. Professional services revenues consist of fees associated with the implementation and configuration of our subscription service. Our pricing for professional services are primarily on a time-and-materials basis. We generally invoice our professional services monthly in arrears based on actual hours and expenses incurred. Other revenues include primarily fees from customer training delivered on-site or publicly available classes, royalties from licensing training materials, attendance and sponsorship fees for our annual Knowledge user conference and other customer forums. Typical payment terms require our customers to pay us within 30 days of invoice. Refer to “Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates” below for further discussion of our revenue recognition accounting policy.Allocation of Overhead Costs Overhead costs associated with office facilities, IT and certain depreciation related to non-cloud-based infrastructure are allocated to cost of revenues and operating expenses based on headcount. Facility costs associated with our data centers (included as part of data center capacity costs) as well as depreciation related to our cloud-based infrastructure hardware equipment are classified as cost of subscription revenues. Cost of Revenues Cost of subscription revenues. Cost of subscription revenues consists primarily of expenses related to hosting our services and providing support to our customers. These expenses are comprised of data center capacity costs, depreciation related to our cloud-based infrastructure hardware equipment, amortization of acquired developed technology intangibles, personnel related costs directly associated with our cloud-based infrastructure and customer support, including salaries, benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation and allocated overhead. Cost of professional services and other revenues. Cost of professional services and other revenues consists primarily of personnel related costs directly associated with our professional services and training departments, including salaries, benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation, the costs of contracted third-party vendors and allocated overhead.31Professional services associated with the implementation and configuration of our subscription services are performed directly by our services team, as well as by contracted third-party vendors. Fees paid to third-party vendors are primarily recognized as cost of revenues as the professional services are delivered. Cost of revenues associated with our professional services engagements contracted with third-party vendors as a percentage of professional services and other revenues was 17%, 17% and 26% for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.Sales and Marketing Expenses Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel related expenses directly associated with our sales and marketing staff, including salaries, benefits, bonuses, commissions and stock-based compensation. Sales and marketing expenses also includes third-party referral fees, marketing and promotional events, including our annual Knowledge user conference, online marketing, product marketing and allocated overhead. Research and Development Expenses Research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel related expenses directly associated with our research and development staff, including salaries, benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation and allocated overhead. General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel related expenses for our executive, finance, legal, human resources and administrative personnel, including salaries, benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation, external legal, accounting and other professional services fees, other corporate expenses and allocated overhead. Provision for Income Taxes The provision for income taxes consists of federal, state and foreign income taxes. Due to cumulative losses, we maintain a valuation allowance against our U.S. deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2014 and 2013. We consider all available evidence, both positive and negative, including but not limited to, earnings history, projected future outcomes, industry and market trends and the nature of each of the deferred tax assets in assessing the extent to which a valuation allowance should be applied against our U.S. deferred tax assets.32Results of Operations To enhance comparability, the following table sets forth our results of operations for the periods presented. The period-to-period comparison of financial results is not necessarily indicative of future results.

The number of deals with new ACV greater than $1 million entered into during the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 were 36 and 14, respectively. We define new ACV as ACV from new customers and upsells to existing customers. The average new customer contract term were 34 months and 33 months for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The average upsell contract term and average renewal contract term remained at 24 months and 26 months, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013. We calculate the average contract term for new customers, upsells, and renewals based on the term of those contracts entered into during the period weighted by their ACV. Revenues from our direct sales organization and channel partners represented 87% and 13%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2014 and 88% and 12%, respectively for the year ended December 31, 2013.Professional services and other revenues increased $40.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to the prior year, due to an increase in the services provided to our growing customer base. In addition, revenues from our annual Knowledge user conference increased to $8.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $5.0 million in the prior year due to increased sponsorship and paid registrations in the current year.Our annual total revenues per customer increased to approximately $287,000 for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to approximately $238,000 for the year ended December 31, 2013. Our annual total revenues per customer is the sum of average quarterly revenues for the trailing four quarters. We calculate average quarterly revenues per customer by dividing the quarter’s revenues by the average number of customers in the quarter. In the second quarter of 2014, we made a change to our calculation to improve the accuracy of our average revenues per customer. In this filing, we have used this updated calculation for each of the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013. The change in methodology increased the annual total revenues per customer that we had disclosed in the prior year by 3%. 35Cost of Revenues and Gross Profit Percentage Year Ended December 31, % Change 2014 2013 (dollars in thousands) Cost of revenues: Subscription$142,687 $87,928 62%Professional services and other106,089 67,331 58%Total cost of revenues$248,776 $155,259 60%Gross profit percentage: Subscription75% 75% Professional services and other8% 10% Total gross profit percentage63% 63% Gross profit:$433,787 $269,391 61%Headcount (at period end) Subscription478 341 40%Professional services and other416 295 41%Total headcount894 636 41% Cost of subscription revenues increased $54.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to the prior year, primarily due to increased headcount resulting in an increase of $22.9 million in personnel related costs excluding stock-based compensation, an increase of $6.6 million in stock-based compensation, an increase of $6.3 million in depreciation expense primarily due to purchases of cloud-based infrastructure hardware equipment for our data centers and an increase of $4.4 million in other overhead expenses. Data center capacity costs increased $5.4 million primarily due to the expansion of our data centers. Amortization of intangible assets increased $5.4 million as a result of the acquisition of Neebula Systems, Ltd., or Neebula, in July 2014. Our subscription gross profit percentage was 75% for each of the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013. We expect our cost of subscription revenues to increase in absolute dollar terms as we provide subscription services to more customers and increase the number of users within our customer instances, but we expect such increase to be at a slower rate than the increase in our subscription revenue, leading to a slight increase in our subscription gross profit percentage for the year ended December 31, 2015 as we continue to leverage the investments we have made in our existing data center infrastructure. To the extent future acquisitions are consummated, our cost of subscription revenues may increase due to additional non-cash charges associated with the amortization of intangible assets acquired. We expect to incur a GAAP loss for the year ended December 31, 2015, due to increased costs such as non-cash charges associated with equity awards and business combinations and other expenses. Cost of professional services and other revenues increased $38.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the prior year, primarily due to increased headcount resulting in an increase of $21.6 million in personnel related costs excluding stock-based compensation, an increase of $8.4 million in stock-based compensation, an increase of $3.2 million in overhead expenses, and an increase of $6.0 million in contracted third-party vendor costs.Our professional services and other gross profit percentage decreased to 8% during the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to 10% in the prior year due to increased stock-based compensation. The decrease in gross profit percentage was partially offset by the increase in revenues from our annual Knowledge user conference. Costs associated with Knowledge are included in sales and marketing expense. Knowledge contributed $8.2 million, or 7 percentage points to the professional services and other gross profit percentage for the year ended December 31, 2014. Knowledge contributed $5.0 million in revenue, or 6 percentage points to the professional services and other gross profit percentage for the year ended December 31, 2013. We expect our gross profit percentage from professional services and other to remain relatively flat for the year ended December 31, 2015. 36Sales and Marketing Year Ended December 31 % Change 2014 2013 (dollars in thousands) Sales and marketing$341,119 $195,190 75%Percentage of revenues50% 46% Headcount (at period end)1,011 615 64% Sales and marketing expenses increased $145.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to the prior year, primarily due to increased headcount that resulted in an increase of $67.5 million in personnel related costs excluding stock-based compensation, an increase of $32.4 million in stock-based compensation, an increase of $8.6 million in overhead expenses, and an increase of $21.6 million in commission expense. Commissions and referral fee expenses amounted to 10% of subscription revenues for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013. In addition, expenses related to our annual Knowledge user conference increased $7.0 million, from $8.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 to $15.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, due to an increase in attendance of more than 50% year-over-year. All other marketing program expenses, which include events, advertising and market data, increased $6.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the prior year.We expect sales and marketing expenses to increase for the year ended December 31, 2015 in absolute dollar terms, but remain relatively flat as a percentage of total revenues as we continue to expand our direct sales force, increase our marketing activities, grow our international operations, build brand awareness and sponsor additional marketing events.Research and Development Year Ended December 31 % Change 2014 2013 (dollars in thousands) Research and development$148,258 $78,678 88%Percentage of revenues22% 18% Headcount (at period end)585 352 66% Research and development expenses increased $69.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to the prior year, primarily due to increased headcount which resulted in an increase of $34.9 million in personnel related costs excluding stock-based compensation, an increase of $26.3 million in stock-based compensation and an increase of $6.7 million in overhead expenses. We expect research and development expenses to increase for the year ended December 31, 2015 in absolute dollar terms, but remain flat as a percentage of total revenues as we continue to improve the existing functionality of our services, develop new applications to fill market needs and continue to enhance our core platform. 37General and Administrative Year Ended December 31 % Change 2014 2013 (dollars in thousands) General and administrative$96,245 $61,790 56%Percentage of revenues14% 14% Headcount (at period end)336 227 48% General and administrative expenses increased $34.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to the prior year, primarily due to increased headcount which resulted in an increase of $10.3 million in personnel related costs excluding stock-based compensation, an increase of $15.1 million in stock-based compensation and an increase of $3.0 million in overhead expenses. Outside services increased $4.5 million primarily due to an increase in legal fees associated with our litigation, an increase in the number of contractors to support our administrative functions and costs associated with the acquisition of Neebula.We expect general and administrative expenses to increase for the year ended December 31, 2015 in absolute dollar terms as we continue to hire people and incur costs associated with our litigation, but to decrease as a percentage of total revenues as we continue to grow.Stock-based Compensation Year Ended December 31 % Change 2014 2013 (dollars in thousands) Cost of revenues: Subscription$14,988 $8,434 78%Professional services and other13,116 4,749 176%Sales and marketing54,006 21,609 150%Research and development42,535 16,223 162%General and administrative29,674 14,566 104%Total stock-based compensation$154,319 $65,581 135%Percentage of revenues23% 15% Stock-based compensation increased $88.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to the prior year, primarily due to increased headcount, an increase in the weighted-average grant date fair value of stock awards, and performance RSUs granted to our executives in the current year. The new equity incentive awards granted in the current year, including the performance RSUs, resulted in an increase of $75.1 million in stock-based compensation. The weighted-average grant date exercise price per stock option share was $61.40 and $38.07 for the year ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The weighted-average grant date fair value per restricted stock unit was $61.13 and $38.15 for the year ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. In addition, stock-based compensation increased $19.9 million related to equity incentive awards granted in the prior year, for which a partial year of expense was recognized in the prior year and $2.4 million related to increased participation in our employee stock purchase plan. The increase in stock-based compensation was partially offset by stock awards forfeited in the current year and stock awards fully vesting in the current year. Stock-based compensation is inherently difficult to forecast due to fluctuations in our stock price and the uncertainty around the achievement of performance criteria associated with our performance RSUs. We expect stock-based compensation to continue to increase for the year ended December 31, 2015 in absolute dollar terms and as a percentage of total revenues. We expect to incur a GAAP loss for the year ended December 31, 2015, due to increased costs such as non-cash charges associated with equity awards and business combinations and other expenses. 38Interest and Other Income (Expense), net Year Ended December 31 % Change 2014 2013 (dollars in thousands) Interest expense related to the Notes$(29,059) $(3,498) 731 %Interest income2,964 1,053 181 %Foreign currency exchange gain/(loss)2,490 (2,493) (200)%Other(100) 8 NMInterest and other income/(expense), net$(23,705) $(4,930) NMPercentage of revenues(2)% (1)% Interest and other expense, net, increased $18.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to the prior year, primarily due to a $25.6 million increase in amortization expense of debt discount and issuance costs related to our convertible senior notes (the ""Notes"") issued in November 2013, partially offset by a gain from foreign currency transactions and increased interest income. We had a foreign currency transaction gain of $2.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to a loss of $2.5 million for the prior year, primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar against other major currencies and an increase in our foreign operations. Interest income increased $1.9 million due to the higher investment balances during the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the prior year. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we expect to incur approximately $31.1 million in amortization expense of debt discount and issuance costs related to the Notes. Our expanding international operations will continue to increase our exposure to currency risks, though we cannot presently predict the impact of this exposure on our consolidated financial statements.While we have not engaged in the hedging of our foreign currency transactions to date, we are presently evaluating the costs and benefits of initiating such a program and may hedge selected significant transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar in the future. Provision for Income Taxes Year Ended December 31 % Change 2014 2013 (dollars in thousands) Loss before income taxes$(175,540) $(71,197) 147%Provision for income taxes3,847 2,511 53%Effective tax rate(2)% (4)% Our effective tax rate was (2)% for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to (4)% for the prior year. Our tax expense increased $1.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to the prior year, primarily due to a higher proportion of taxable earnings in foreign jurisdictions. See Note 16 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. for our reconciliation of income taxes at the statutory federal rate to the provision for income taxes.We continue to maintain a full valuation allowance on our U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets, and the significant components of the tax expense recorded are current cash taxes in various jurisdictions. The cash tax expenses are impacted by each jurisdiction’s individual tax rates, laws on timing of recognition of income and deductions, and availability of net operating losses and tax credits. Given the full valuation allowance, sensitivity of current cash taxes to local rules and our foreign structuring, we expect our effective tax rate could fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis and could be adversely affected to the extent earnings are lower than anticipated in countries that have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher statutory rates. We consider the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the United States.39 Comparison of the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 Revenues Year Ended December 31, % Change 2013 2012 (dollars in thousands) Revenues: Subscription$349,804 $204,526 71%Professional services and other74,846 39,186 91%Total revenues$424,650 $243,712 74%Percentage of revenues: Subscription82% 84% Professional services and other18 16 Total100% 100% Subscription revenues increased $145.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2013, compared to the prior year, driven by our upsells, renewals and an increase in our customer count. Our upsell rate and renewal rate for the trailing twelve months ending December 31, 2013 were 31% and 96%, respectively, compared to 30% and 97%, respectively, for the trailing twelve months ending December 31, 2012. Total customer count at December 31, 2013 was 2,061 compared to 1,512 at December 31, 2012, an increase of 36%. Revenues from our direct sales organization and channel partners represented 88% and 12%, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012.Professional services and other revenues increased $35.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2013, compared to the prior year, due to an increase in the services provided to our growing customer base, increase in utilization and improvements in pricing of our professional services engagements. In addition, revenues from our annual Knowledge user conference increased to $5.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to $2.0 million in the prior year due to increased sponsorship and paid registrations.Our annual total revenues per customer increased to approximately $238,000 for the year ended December 31, 2013, compared to approximately $199,000 for the year ended December 31, 2012. Our annual total revenues per customer is the sum of average quarterly revenues for the trailing four quarters. We calculate average quarterly revenues per customer by dividing the quarter’s revenues by the average number of customers in the quarter. In the second quarter of 2014, we made a change to our calculation to improve the accuracy of our average revenues per customer. In this filing, we have used this updated calculation for each of the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012. The change in methodology increased the annual total revenues per customer that we had disclosed in the prior year by 5%. 40Cost of Revenues and Gross Profit (Loss) Percentage Year Ended December 31, % Change 2013 2012 (dollars in thousands) Cost of revenues: Subscription$87,928 $63,258 39%Professional services and other67,331 40,751 65%Total cost of revenues$155,259 $104,009 49%Gross profit (loss) percentage: Subscription75% 69 % Professional services and other10% (4)% Total gross profit percentage63% 57 % Gross profit:$269,391 $139,703 93%Headcount (at period end) Subscription341 218 56%Professional services and other295 183 61%Total headcount636 401 59% Cost of subscription revenues increased $24.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2013, compared to the prior year, primarily due to increased headcount resulting in an increase of $14.6 million in personnel related costs excluding stock-based compensation, an increase of $4.5 million in stock-based compensation, an increase of $4.7 million in depreciation expense primarily due to purchases of cloud-based infrastructure hardware equipment for our data centers and an increase of $2.7 million in other overhead expenses. Data center capacity costs decreased $1.8 million primarily due to the migration of customers from our managed service data centers to our co-location data centers. Our subscription gross profit percentage was 75% for the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to 69% for the prior year. Cost of professional services and other revenues increased $26.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2013 as compared to the prior year primarily due to increased headcount resulting in an increase of $17.3 million in personnel related costs excluding stock-based compensation, an increase of $3.2 million in stock-based compensation, an increase of $2.1 million in overhead expenses, and an increase of $3.7 million in outside services costs.Our professional services and other gross profit (loss) percentage increased to 10% during the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to (4)% in the prior year due to improved scoping and pricing on customer engagements, better resource utilization and an increase in revenues from our annual Knowledge user conference which contributed six percentage points to the professional services and other gross profit percentage for each of the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012. All related expenses from our annual Knowledge user conference are recorded in sales and marketing.

Commissions increased primarily due to growth in bookings and current year changes to our commission plans that place more emphasis on achieving quarterly targets and allow for participants in the plan to increase their compensation at a higher rate for exceeding their annual targets. Commissions and referral fees amounted to 10% and 8% of subscription revenues for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Marketing and event expenses increased $10.7 million, which included a $4.7 million increase in expenses related to our annual Knowledge user conference due to attendance more than doubling compared to the prior year.

Outside services increased $2.9 million primarily due to our international expansion and the acquisition of Mirror42 Holding B.V. The increase is also related to costs associated with our first full year of being a public company.Stock-based Compensation Year Ended December 31 % Change 2013 2012 (dollars in thousands) Cost of revenues: Subscription$8,434 $3,929 115%Professional services and other4,749 1,574 202%Sales and marketing21,609 10,189 112%Research and development16,223 6,496 150%General and administrative14,566 5,749 153%Total stock-based compensation$65,581 $27,937 135%Percentage of revenues15% 11% 42 Stock-based compensation increased $37.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2013, compared to the prior year, primarily due to increased headcount and an increase in the weighted-average grant date fair value of stock awards. The new equity incentive awards granted in the year ended December 31, 2013 resulted in an increase of $29.0 million in stock-based compensation. The weighted-average grant date exercise price per stock option share was $38.07 and $15.03 for the year ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The weighted-average grant date fair value per restricted stock unit was $38.15 and $17.02 for the year ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. In addition, stock-based compensation increased $7.4 million related to equity incentive awards granted in the prior year, for which a partial year of expenses was recognized in the prior year and $2.7 million related to our employee purchase plan which became effective on June 28, 2012. The increase in stock-based compensation was partially offset by stock awards forfeited in the current year and stock awards fully vesting in the current year.

We had a foreign currency transaction loss of $2.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 as compared to a gain of $1.1 million for the prior year, primarily due to the strengthening of the Euro against other major currencies and an increase in our foreign operations. The decrease was partially offset by an increase of $0.7 million in interest income due to the higher investment balances during the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to the prior year.

Our tax expense increased $1.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2013 as compared to the prior year due to a higher proportion of earnings in foreign jurisdictions with high statutory tax rates, a higher loss from U.S. operations, the tax effect of acquired companies, and the issuance of the Notes. See Note 16 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for our reconciliation of income taxes at the statutory federal rate to the provision for income taxes.43Quarterly Results of Operations The following table sets forth our unaudited quarterly consolidated statements of operations. We have prepared the quarterly data on a consistent basis with the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In the opinion of management, the financial information reflects all necessary adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair statement of this data. This information should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The results of historical periods are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for a full year or any future period.

We sign a significantly higher percentage of agreements with new customers, as well as renewal agreements with existing customers, in the quarter ended December 31. The increase in customer agreements for the quarter ended December 31 is primarily a result of the terms of our commission plans to incentivize our direct sales force to meet their quotas by December 31 and large enterprise account buying patterns typical in the software industry. Furthermore, we usually sign a significant portion of these agreements during the last month, and often the last two weeks, of each quarter. This seasonality is reflected to a much lesser extent, and sometimes is not immediately apparent, in our revenues, due to the fact that we recognize subscription revenues over the term of the license agreement, which is generally 12 to 36 months. Although these seasonal factors are common in the technology industry, historical patterns should not be considered a reliable indicator of our future sales activity or performance. Our revenues have increased over the periods presented due to increased sales to new customers, as well as upsells to existing customers. We have historically seen an increase in professional services and other revenues in the quarter ended June 30, and a corresponding decrease in professional services and other revenues in the quarter ended September 30 due to the revenues earned from our annual Knowledge user conference that occurs in the quarter ended June 30. Our operating expenses have increased over the periods presented primarily due to increases in headcount and other related expenses to support our growth. We have historically seen an increase in marketing expenses in the quarter ended June 30, and a corresponding decrease in marketing expenses in the quarter ended September 30 due to the expenses incurred for our annual Knowledge user conference. We anticipate operating expenses will continue to increase in future periods as we continue to focus on investing in the long-term growth of our business. Liquidity and Capital Resources Year Ended December 31, 2014 2013 2012 (dollars in thousands)Net cash provided by operating activities$138,900$81,746 $48,766Net cash used in investing activities(316,928)(402,795) (239,149)Net cash provided by financing activities70,772568,570 241,839Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents, net of impact of exchange rates on cash(113,848)247,314 50,901 Our principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents, investments, and cash generated from operations. As of December 31, 2014, we had $668.8 million in cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, of which $78.4 million represented cash located overseas. In addition, we had $266.8 million in long-term investments which provide additional capital resources.In November 2013, we issued Notes with an aggregate principal amount of $575.0 million and concurrently entered into a hedge, or Note Hedge, and warrant transaction, or Warrants. The net proceeds of this debt issuance are being used for general corporate purposes, including potential acquisitions and strategic transactions. The Warrants are exercisable at a strike price of $107.46 per share. Upon conversion of the Notes, we may choose to pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock. As of December 31, 2014, the Notes were not convertible. We anticipate our current cash and cash equivalents balance and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs including the expansion of data centers, lease obligations, expenditures related to the growth of our headcount and the acquisition of fixed assets and investments in office facilities to accommodate our growth for at least the next 12 months. Whether these resources are adequate to meet our liquidity needs beyond that period will depend on our growth, operating results, cash utilized for acquisitions, if any are consummated, and the capital expenditures required to meet possible increased demand for our services. If we require additional capital resources to grow our business at any time in the future, we may seek to finance our operations from the current funds available or seek additional equity or debt financing. Operating Activities Cash provided by operating activities mainly consists of net income adjusted for certain non-cash items, including depreciation and amortization, amortization of issuance cost and debt discount, stock-based compensation, tax benefits from employee stock plans and changes in operating assets and liabilities during the year.45Net cash provided by operating activities was $138.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $81.7 million for the prior year. The increase in operating cash flow was primarily due to an increased net loss offset by a substantial increase in non-cash adjustments to reconcile net loss to net cash provided by operations and the favorable impact on operating cash flow from changes in operating assets and liabilities. Net cash flow from the aggregate of changes in accounts receivable, deferred commissions and deferred revenue increased due to increased sales for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in net cash flows from the aggregate of changes in accrued liabilities, accounts payable and prepaid expenses due to the growth of our business and increased headcount of 54% for the year ended December 31, 2014.Net cash provided by operating activities was $81.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to $48.8 million for the prior year. The increase in operating cash flow was primarily due to an increased net loss offset by a substantial increase in non-cash adjustments to reconcile net loss to net cash provided by operations and the favorable impact on operating cash flow from changes in operating assets and liabilities. Net cash flow from the aggregate of changes in accounts receivable, deferred commissions and deferred revenue increased due to increased sales for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase was offset by a decrease in net cash flows from the aggregate of changes in accrued liabilities, accounts payable and prepaid expenses due to the growth of our business and increased headcount of 70% for the year ended December 31, 2013. Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $316.9 million compared to $402.8 million for the prior year. The decrease in cash used in investing activities was mainly due to a decrease in the net purchases of investments of $171.3 million. The decrease was offset by an increase of $86.5 million in acquisition activity due to the Neebula acquisition in 2014. Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2013 was $402.8 million compared to $239.1 million for the prior year. The increase in cash used in investing activities was mainly due to increases in the net purchases of investments of $136.8 million and capital expenditures of $13.3 million related to the purchase of cloud-based infrastructure hardware equipment to support the expansion of our data centers as well as investments in leasehold improvements, furniture and equipment to support our headcount growth. Additionally, in 2013 we paid $13.3 million for the acquisition of Mirror42 Holding B.V. Financing Activities Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $70.8 million compared to $568.6 million for the prior year. The decrease in cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to net proceeds of $511.7 million from issuance of the Notes and Warrants and purchase of the Note Hedge in 2013. The decrease was offset by $13.2 million increase in proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options and the Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or ESPP and related tax benefit. Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2013 was $568.6 million compared to $241.8 million for the prior year. The increase in cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to net proceeds of $511.7 million from issuance of the Notes and Warrants and purchase of the Note Hedge, and $38.8 million increase in proceeds from exercise of employee stock options and $13.2 million proceeds from our ESPP. For the year ended December 31, 2012, we received $169.8 million net proceeds from our IPO, $50.6 million net proceeds from our follow-on offering, and $17.8 million net proceeds from the issuance of common stock.46Contractual Obligations and Commitments Contractual obligations represent future cash commitments and liabilities under agreements with third parties, and exclude orders for goods and services entered into in the normal course of business that are not enforceable or legally binding. The following table represents our known contractual obligations as of December 31, 2014, aggregated by type: Payments Due by PeriodContractual ObligationsTotal LessThan1 Year 1 – 3Years 3 – 5Years MoreThan5 Years (in thousands)Operating leases: Data centers(1)$20,009 $9,561 $9,186 $1,238 $24Facilities space(2)263,563 15,511 52,872 51,337 143,843Convertible Senior Notes575,000 — — 575,000 —Other4,876 297 1,018 1,018 2,543Total contractual obligations$863,448 $25,369 $63,076 $628,593 $146,410 (1)Operating leases for data centers represent our principal commitment for co-location facilities for data center capacity.(2)Operating leases for facilities space represent our principal commitments, which consists of obligations under office space leases. In addition to the obligations in the table above, approximately $2.9 million of unrecognized tax benefits have been recorded as liabilities as of December 31, 2014. It is uncertain as to if or when such amounts may be settled. We have also recorded a liability for potential penalties of $0.2 million and interest of $0.2 million related to these unrecognized tax benefits.Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements During all periods presented, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. As such, we are not exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in those types of relationships. Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates Our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. These items are monitored and analyzed by us for changes in facts and circumstances, and material changes in these estimates could occur in the future. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Changes in estimates are reflected in reported results for the period in which they become known. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions and such differences could be material. While our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe that the following accounting policies are critical to the process of making significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our audited consolidated financial statements. Revenue RecognitionWe derive our revenues from two sources: (i) subscriptions and (ii) professional services and other. Subscription revenues are primarily comprised of subscription fees that give customers access to the ordered subscription service, related support and updates to the subscribed service during the subscription term. Our contracts typically do not give the customer the right to take possession of the software supporting the services. Professional services and other revenues consist of fees associated with the implementation and configuration of our services. 47Professional services and other revenues also include customer training and attendance and sponsorship fees for Knowledge, our annual user conference.We commence revenue recognition when all of the following conditions are met: •There is persuasive evidence of an arrangement;•The service has been provided to the customer;•The collection of related fees is reasonably assured; and•The amount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable.We use a signed contract together with a signed order form or a purchase order, as evidence of an arrangement for a new customer. In subsequent transactions with an existing customer, including an upsell or a renewal, we consider the existing signed contract and either the new signed order form or new purchase order as evidence of an arrangement. We recognize subscription revenues ratably over the contract term beginning on the commencement date of each contract, the date we make our services available to our customers. Once our services are available to customers, we record amounts due in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue. We price professional services primarily on a time-and-materials basis and recognize professional services revenues as the services are delivered using a proportional performance model. Such services are delivered over a short period of time. In instances where final acceptance of the services are required before revenues are recognized, we defer professional services revenues and the associated costs until all acceptance criteria have been met. We assess collectibility based on a number of factors such as past collection history with the customer and creditworthiness of the customer. If we determine collectibility is not reasonably assured, we defer revenue recognition until collectibility becomes reasonably assured. We assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment. Our arrangements do not include general rights of return. We have multiple element arrangements comprised of subscription fees and professional services. We account for subscription and professional services revenues as separate units of accounting. To qualify as a separate unit of accounting, the delivered item must have value to the customer on a standalone basis. We have concluded that our subscription service has standalone value as it is routinely sold separately by us. In addition, the applications offered through this subscription service are fully functional without any additional development, modification or customization. We provide customers access to our subscription service at the beginning of the contract term. In determining whether professional services have standalone value, we considered the following factors for each professional services agreement: availability of the services from other vendors, the nature of the professional services, the timing of when the professional services contract was signed in comparison to the subscription service start date and the contractual dependence of the subscription service on the customer’s satisfaction with the professional services work. Our professional services, including implementation and configuration services, are not so unique and complex that other vendors cannot provide them. In some instances, customers independently contract with third-party vendors to do the implementation and we regularly outsource implementation services to contracted third-party vendors. As a result, we concluded professional services, including implementation and configuration services, have standalone value. We determine the selling price of each deliverable in the arrangement using the selling price hierarchy. Under the selling price hierarchy, the selling price for each deliverable is determined using vendor-specific objective evidence, or VSOE, of selling price or third-party evidence, or TPE, of selling price if VSOE does not exist. If neither VSOE nor TPE of selling price exists for a deliverable, the selling price is determined using the best estimate of selling price, or BESP. The selling price for each unit of accounting is based on the BESP since VSOE and TPE are not available for our subscription service or professional services and other. The BESP for each deliverable is determined primarily by considering the historical selling price of these deliverables in similar transactions as well as other factors, including, but not limited to, market competition, review of stand-alone sales and current pricing practices. In determining the appropriate pricing structure, we consider the extent of competitive pricing of similar products and marketing analysis. The total arrangement fee for these multiple element arrangements is then allocated to the separate units of accounting based on the relative selling price. The BESP for our subscription service is based upon the historical selling price of these deliverables. In limited circumstances, we grant certain customers the right to deploy our subscription service on the customers’ own servers without significant penalty. These arrangements are subject to software revenue recognition guidance since the customer deploys our software. We have analyzed all of the elements in these particular multiple element arrangements and determined that we do not have sufficient VSOE of fair value to allocate revenue to our subscription service and professional services. Consequently, we defer all revenue and related costs under the arrangement until the last element in the transaction has been delivered or started to be delivered. Once the subscription service and the professional services have commenced, we recognize the entire fee and related costs from the arrangement ratably over the remaining period of the arrangement.48Deferred revenue consists primarily of payments received in advance of revenue recognition for our subscriptions and professional services and other revenues and is recognized as the revenue recognition criteria are met.Deferred Commissions Deferred commissions are the incremental selling costs that are directly associated with our customer contracts and consist of sales commissions paid to our direct sales force and referral fees paid to independent third-parties. The majority of commissions and referral fees are deferred and amortized on a straight-line basis over the non-cancelable terms of the related customer contracts. We include amortization of deferred commissions in sales and marketing expense in the consolidated statements of comprehensive loss. We believe this is the preferable method of accounting as the commission charges are so closely related to the revenue from the customer contracts that they should be recorded as an asset and charged to expense over the same period that the revenue is recognized. Goodwill, Intangible Assets and Other Long Lived AssetsGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price in a business combination over the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired. We evaluate and test the recoverability of goodwill for impairment at least annually, during our fourth quarter, or more frequently if circumstances indicate that goodwill may not be recoverable. We perform the impairment testing by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of its reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we perform a two-step impairment test. The first step requires the identification of the reporting units and comparison of the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an indication of goodwill impairment exists for the reporting unit and the second step of the impairment test is performed to compute the amount of the impairment. Under the second step, an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit's goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill. We have determined that we have only one reporting unit. We did not recognize any impairment charges related to goodwill during the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013.Intangible assets are amortized over their useful lives ranging from 18 months to seven years. Each period we evaluate the estimated remaining useful life of purchased intangible assets to determine whether events or changes in circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization. We periodically review the carrying amounts of these assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable. We measure the recoverability of these assets by comparing the carrying amount of each asset to the future undiscounted cash flows we expect the asset to generate. If we consider any of these assets to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized equals the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. Screening for and assessing whether impairment indicators exist or if events or changes in circumstances have occurred, including market conditions, operating fundamentals, competition and general economic conditions, requires significant judgment. Additionally, changes in the technology industry occur frequently and quickly. Therefore, there can be no assurance that a charge to operating expenses will not occur as a result of future goodwill, intangible assets and other long-lived assets impairment tests. Stock-based Compensation We recognize compensation expense related to stock options and restricted stock units, or RSUs, on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting term of four years. For RSUs granted with a performance condition, the expenses are recognized on a graded vesting basis over the vesting period, after assessing the probability of achieving requisite performance criteria. This has the impact of greater stock-based compensation expense during the initial years of the vesting period as stock-based compensation cost is recognized over the requisite service period for each separately vesting tranche of the award as though the award were, in substance, multiple awards. We recognize compensation expense related to shares issued pursuant to the ESPP, on a straight-line basis over the offering period. We estimate the fair value of options using the Black-Scholes options pricing model and fair value of RSU awards using the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant. We recognize compensation expense net of estimated forfeiture activity, which is based on historical forfeiture rates. We evaluate the forfeiture rates at least annually, or when events or circumstances indicate a change may be needed. This may cause a fluctuation in our stock-based compensation in the period of change. 49Income Taxes We use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes, in which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. We measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be reversed. We recognize the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates as income and expense in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is established if it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. In determining the need for a valuation allowance, we consider future growth, forecasted earnings, future taxable income, the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate, historical earnings, taxable income in prior years, if carryback is permitted under the law, carry-forward periods, and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies.Our tax positions are subject to income tax audits by multiple tax jurisdictions throughout the world. We recognize the tax benefit of an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not the position is sustainable upon examination by the taxing authority, based on the technical merits. We measure the tax benefit recognized as the largest amount of benefit which is more likely than not to be realized upon settlement with the taxing authority. We recognize interest accrued and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in our tax provision. Significant judgment is required to evaluate uncertain tax positions. Our evaluations are based upon a number of factors, including changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law or guidance, correspondence with tax authorities during the course of audits and effective settlement of audit issues. Changes in the recognition or measurement of uncertain tax positions could result in material increases or decreases in our income tax expense in the period in which we make the change, which could have a material impact on our effective tax rate and operating results.We calculate the current and deferred income tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed in subsequent years and record adjustments based on filed income tax returns when identified. The amount of income taxes paid is subject to examination by U.S. federal, state and foreign tax authorities. The estimate of the potential outcome of any uncertain tax issue is subject to management’s assessment of relevant risks, facts and circumstances existing at that time. To the extent the assessment of such tax position changes, we record the change in estimate in the period in which we make the determination. Recent Accounting PronouncementsIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued an update to ASC 606 Revenue from Contracts with Customers, or ASC 606, that will supersede virtually all existing revenue guidance. Under this update, an entity is required to recognize revenue upon transfer of promised goods or services to customers, in an amount that reflects the expected consideration received in exchange for those goods or services. As such, an entity will need to use more judgment and make more estimates than under the current guidance. This update should be applied retrospectively either to each prior reporting period presented in the financial statements, or only to the most current reporting period presented in the financial statements with a cumulative effect adjustment recorded in the retained earnings. This guidance will become effective for us for our interim and annual reporting periods beginning January 1, 2017. We are currently evaluating the impact of this update on our consolidated financial statements.ITEM 7A.QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Foreign Currency Exchange Risk We have foreign currency risks related to our revenue and operating expenses denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, primarily the Euro and British Pound Sterling. We are a net receiver of Euro and therefore are adversely affected by a strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to these currencies. Revenues denominated in U.S. dollar as a percentage of total revenue was 72%, 77% and 80% during the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Changes in exchange rates have recently and may continue to negatively affect our revenues as denominated in U.S. dollars. We have experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net loss as a result of transaction gains or losses related to remeasuring certain monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entities in which they are recorded. We are unable to accurately forecast the changes in exchange rates and consequent gains and losses from such fluctuations. We recognized a net foreign currency gain of $2.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, and net foreign currency losses of $2.5 million and $1.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. While we have not engaged in the hedging of our foreign currency transactions to date, we may in the future hedge selected significant transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.We estimate that a decline in the value of the U.S. dollar as measured against the other currencies in which our transactions are denominated would have widened our operating loss in the year ended December 31, 2014. A hypothetical 10% decrease in the U.S. dollar against other currencies would result in an approximately $3.5 million increase in operating loss for the year ended December 31, 2014. This analysis disregards the possibilities that rates can move in opposite directions and that losses from one geographic area may be offset by gains from another geographic area. Interest Rate Sensitivity In February 2012, we began investing in corporate debt securities. The primary objectives of our investment activities are the preservation of capital and support of our liquidity requirements. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. Our investments are exposed to market risk due to fluctuations in interest rates, which may affect our interest income and the fair market value of our investments. As of December 31, 2014, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate $5.6 million decline of the fair value of our available-for-sale securities and a hypothetical 100 basis point decrease in interest rates would result in an approximate $5.0 million increase of the fair value of our available-for-sale securities. This estimate is based on a sensitivity model that measures market value changes when changes in interest rates occur.Market RiskIn November 2013, we issued Notes with an aggregate principal amount of $575.0 million. We carry this instrument at face value less unamortized discount on our consolidated balance sheet. Because this instrument does not bear interest, we have no financial statement risk associated with changes in interest rates. However, the fair value of fixed rate instruments fluctuate when interest rates change, and in the case of convertible notes, when the market price of our stock fluctuates.50",2023-12-30 18:26:53.902479

Overview ServiceNow is a leading provider of enterprise cloud computing solutions that define, structure, manage and automate services across the global enterprise. Our mission is to help the modern enterprise operate faster and be more scalable by applying a service-oriented lens to the activities, tasks and processes that comprise day-to-day work life. Our solutions, and the custom solutions built by our customers and partners, are empowering enterprises to change the way people work. We offer our services on an annual subscription fee basis which includes access to the ordered subscription service and related support including updates to the subscribed service during the subscription term. We provide a scaled pricing model based on the duration of the subscription term and we frequently extend discounts to our customers based on the number of users. We generate sales through our direct sales team and indirectly through channel partners and third-party referrals. We also generate revenues from professional services for implementation and training of customer personnel. We generally bill our customers annually in advance for subscription services and monthly in arrears for our professional services as the work is performed. A majority of our revenues come from large global enterprise customers. We continue to invest in the development of our services, infrastructure and sales and marketing to drive long-term growth. We increased our overall employee headcount to 3,686 as of December 31, 2015 from 2,826 as of December 31, 2014. Key Factors Affecting Our Performance Renewal rate. We calculate our renewal rate by subtracting our attrition rate from 100%. Our attrition rate for a period is equal to the annualized contract value, or ACV, from lost customers divided by the total ACV from all customers that renewed during the period, excluding changes in price or users, and total ACV from all lost customers. A lost customer is a customer that did not renew a contract expiring that, in our judgment, will not be renewed. Typically a customer that reduces its subscription upon renewal is not considered a lost customer. However, in instances where the subscription decrease represents the majority of the customer's ACV, we may deem the renewal as a lost customer. Our renewal rate was 98%, 97% and 96% for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.Upsell rate. To grow our business it is important for us to generate additional sales from existing customers, which we refer to as our upsell rate. We calculate our upsell rate as the ACV of upsells, net of losses and reductions in ACV from existing customers during the period, divided by our total ACV signed during the period. Our upsell rate was 38%, 43% and 39% for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. We expect our upsell rate to decrease in the long term as our renewal base continues to grow.Our upsells are primarily derived from an increase in the number of user seats purchased by our customers and are also derived from the addition of other subscription services. In the first quarter of 2015, we made a change to our customer count definition to better align to a global standard for business identification and tracking. Refer to the “Total customers” paragraph below for further details about the change. The change in customer count definition increased the upsell rate we had disclosed in the prior year from 36% to 43% for the year ended December 31, 2014, and from 31% to 39% for the year ended December 31, 2013. 35Total customers. We believe our total customer count is a key indicator of our market penetration, growth and future revenues. We have aggressively invested in, and intend to continue to invest in, our direct sales force and partnerships with our indirect sales channel in order to grow our customer base. Based on our new definition of customer count as described below, our total enterprise customer count was approximately 3,000, 2,300 and 1,800, as of December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. As of December 31, 2015, we had approximately 400 customers that have purchased our Express product offering (“Express customers”), which is our entry-level IT service management solution. Our Express customer count as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 was less than 100.In the first quarter of 2015, we changed our definition of customer count to better align to a global standard for business identification and tracking. Previously, we generally defined a customer as an entity with an active subscription contract as of the measurement date. In situations where a single contract applied to entities with multiple subsidiaries or divisions, universities or governmental organizations, each entity that contracted for a separate production instance of our services was counted as a separate customer. Beginning on January 1, 2015, a customer is defined as an entity with a unique Dunn & Bradstreet Global Ultimate, or GULT, Data Universal Numbering System, or DUNS, and an active subscription contract as of the measurement date. The DUNS number is a global standard for business identification and tracking. We will make exceptions for holding companies, government entities and other organizations for which the GULT, in our judgment, does not accurately represent the ServiceNow customer. For example, while all U.S. government agencies roll up to ""Government of the United States"" under the GULT, we count each government agency that we contract with as a separate customer. The change in customer count definition reduced our enterprise customer count by approximately 14% and 12% as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. We did not previously disclose our Express customer count. As the enterprise customer definition is a factor used in the calculation of other metrics we disclose (upsell rate, number of customers with ACV greater than $1 million, number of deals with net new ACV greater than $1 million and average contract term for new customers, upsells and renewals), we have revised previously disclosed numbers for the impacted metrics to ensure comparability across the periods.Number of customers with ACV greater than $1 million. We count the total number of customers with ACV greater than $1 million as of the end of the period. We had 230, 153 and 81 customers with ACV greater than $1 million as of December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The change in customer count definition increased the total number of customers with ACV greater than $1 million we previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014 from 129 to 153 for the year ended December 31, 2014, and from 67 to 81 for the year ended December 31, 2013.The number of deals with net new ACV greater than $1 million entered into during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, were 36, 34 and 15, respectively. We define net new ACV as ACV from new customers and upsells to existing customers, net of losses to those customers. The change in customer count definition decreased the total number of deals with ACV greater than $1 million we had disclosed in the prior year from 36 to 34 for the year ended December 31, 2014, and increased the total number of deals with ACV greater than $1 million from 14 to 15 for the year ended December 31, 2013.G2K customer count. The Global 2000, or G2K, customer count is defined as the total number of G2K companies in our customer base as of the end of the period. The Forbes Global 2000 is an annual ranking of the top 2000 public companies in the world by Forbes magazine. The ranking is based on a mix of four metrics: sales, profit, assets, and market value. The Forbes Global 2000 is updated annually in the second quarter of the calendar year. Current and prior period G2K customer counts are based on the most recent list for comparability purposes. We adjust the G2K count for acquisitions, spin-offs, and other market activity to ensure the G2K customer count is accurately captured. For example, we add a G2K customer when a G2K company that is not our customer acquires a company in our existing customer base that is not a G2K company. When we enter into a contract with a G2K parent company, or any of its related subsidiaries, or any combination of entities within a G2K company, we count only one G2K customer. We do not count further penetration into entities within the G2K as a new customer in the G2K customer count. Our G2K customer count based on the most recent Forbes Global 2000 and adjusted for acquisitions, spin-offs and other market activity was 638, 538 and 445 as of December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Average ACV per G2K customer. We calculate average ACV for our G2K customers by taking cumulative ACV from G2K customers as of the end of the period divided by the cumulative count of G2K customers as of the end of the period. Our average ACV per G2K customer was approximately $868,000, $711,000 and $515,000 for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013. 36Billings. We define billings as revenue recognized plus the change in total deferred revenue as presented on the consolidated statements of cash flows. The change in total deferred revenue as presented on the consolidated statements of cash flows represent the change in deferred revenues in local currencies translated into U.S. dollars using an average foreign currency exchange rate, and is a better approximation of actual billings as it is more aligned with the exchange rates in effect at the time of the billings. We believe billings offers investors useful supplemental information regarding the performance of our business and will help investors better understand the sales volume and performance of our business. A calculation of billings is provided below: Year Ended December 31, % Change Year Ended December 31, % Change 2015 2014 2013 (dollars in thousands)Billings: Total revenues$1,005,480 $682,563 47% $424,650 61%Change in deferred revenue from the consolidated statements of cash flows195,900 168,393 16% 94,405 78%Total billings$1,201,380 $850,956 41% $519,055 64%Our international operations provide a significant portion of our total billings and revenues. As a result, the general strengthening of the U.S. Dollar relative to other major foreign currencies (primarily the Euro) from the year ended December 31, 2014 to the year ended December 31, 2015 had an unfavorable impact on our billings and revenues. For entities reporting in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar, if we had translated our results for the year ended December 31, 2015 at the exchange rates for the year ended December 31, 2014 rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the period, our total billings would have increased by an additional $74.3 million, with $60.1 million of the increase relating to an increase in total revenues and $14.2 million of the increase relating to the change in deferred revenue from the consolidated statements of cash flows. The impact of currency movement from the year ended December 31, 2013 to the year ended December 31, 2014 did not have a significant impact on billings and revenues.Average contract term. We calculate the average contract term for new customers, upsells and renewals based on the term of those contracts entered into during the period weighted by their ACV. The average new customer contract term was 31 months, 32 months and 34 months for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The average upsell contract term was 26 months, 25 months and 24 months for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The average renewal contract term was 24 months for the year ended December 31, 2015, and 26 months for each of the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013. In the first quarter of 2015, we made a change to our customer count definition to better align to a global standard for business identification and tracking. Refer to the “Total customers” paragraph section above for further details of the change. The change in customer count definition decreased the average new customer contract term from 34 months as disclosed in the prior year to 32 months for the year ended December 31, 2014, and increased the average new customer contract term from 33 months as previously disclosed to 34 months for the year ended December 31, 2013. The change in customer count increased the average upsell contract term from 24 months as disclosed in the prior year to 25 months for the year ended December 31, 2014. The change in customer count definition had no impact to our disclosures in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014 for the average upsell for the year ended December 31, 2013 and the average renewal contract term for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013. 37Free cash flow. We define free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, as GAAP net cash provided by operating activities reduced by purchases of property and equipment. We believe information regarding free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available to invest in our business and fund ongoing operations. However, our calculation of free cash flow may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies. A calculation of free cash flow is provided below: Year Ended December 31, 2015 2014 2013 (dollars in thousands)Free cash flow: Net cash provided by operating activities$315,091 $138,900 $81,746Purchases of property and equipment(87,481) (54,379) (55,321)Free cash flow$227,610 $84,521 $26,425 Components of Results of Operations Revenues Subscription revenues. Subscription revenues are comprised primarily of fees that give customers access to the ordered subscription service, related support and upgrades, if any, to the subscribed service during the subscription term. Pricing includes multiple instances, hosting and support services, data backup and disaster recovery services, as well as future upgrades, when and if available, offered during the subscription term. We typically invoice our customers for subscription fees in annual increments upon execution of the initial contract or subsequent renewal. Our contracts are generally non-cancelable during the subscription term, though a customer can terminate for breach if we materially fail to perform. Professional services and other revenues. Professional services revenues consist of fees associated with the implementation and configuration of our subscription service. Our arrangements for professional services are primarily on a time-and-materials basis. We generally invoice our professional services monthly in arrears based on actual hours and expenses incurred. Other revenues primarily include fees from customer training delivered on-site or publicly available classes, attendance and sponsorship fees for our annual Knowledge user conference and other customer forums. Typical payment terms require our customers to pay us within 30 days of invoice. We generate sales directly through our sales team and, to a lesser extent, through our channel partners. Revenues from our direct sales organization represented 89%, 87% and 88% for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. We make sales to our channel partners at a discount and record those revenues at the discounted price when all revenue recognition criteria are met. From time to time, our channel partners also provide us referrals for which we pay a referral fee. We pay referral fees to channel partners and other third parties, which is between 5% and 15% of the customer's ACV, depending on the level of activity the partner performs in the sales process. We include these fees in sales and marketing expense. Refer to “Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates” below for further discussion of our revenue recognition accounting policy.Allocation of Overhead Costs Overhead costs associated with office facilities, corporate expenses, IT and certain depreciation related to infrastructure that is not dedicated for customer or research and development use are allocated to cost of revenues and operating expenses based on headcount. Cost of Revenues Cost of subscription revenues. Cost of subscription revenues consists primarily of expenses related to hosting our services and providing support to our customers. These expenses are comprised of data center capacity costs, which includes facility costs associated with our data center, depreciation related to our cloud-based infrastructure hardware equipment dedicated for customer use, amortization of acquired developed technology intangibles, personnel related costs directly associated with our cloud-based infrastructure and customer support, including salaries, benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation and allocated overhead. Cost of professional services and other revenues. Cost of professional services and other revenues consists primarily of personnel related costs directly associated with our professional services and training departments, including salaries, benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation, the costs of contracted third-party partners and allocated overhead.38Professional services associated with the implementation and configuration of our subscription services are performed directly by our services team, as well as by contracted third-party partners. Fees paid to third-party partners are primarily recognized as cost of revenues as the professional services are delivered. Cost of revenues associated with our professional services engagements subcontracted to third-party partners as a percentage of professional services and other revenues was 20% for the year ended December 31, 2015, and 17% for each of the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013.Sales and Marketing Expenses Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel related expenses directly associated with our sales and marketing staff, including salaries, benefits, bonuses, commissions and stock-based compensation. Sales and marketing expenses also include third-party referral fees, marketing and promotional events, including our annual Knowledge user conference, online marketing, product marketing and allocated overhead. Research and Development Expenses Research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel related expenses directly associated with our research and development staff, including salaries, benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation and allocated overhead. Research and development expenses also include data center capacity costs and depreciation of cloud-based infrastructure hardware equipment that are used solely for research and development purposes. General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel related expenses for our executive, finance, legal, human resources, facility and administrative personnel, including salaries, benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation, external legal, accounting and other professional services fees, other corporate expenses and allocated overhead. Provision for Income Taxes The provision for income taxes consists of federal, state and foreign income taxes. Due to cumulative losses, we maintain a valuation allowance against our U.S. deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2015 and 2014. We consider all available evidence, both positive and negative, including but not limited to earnings history, projected future outcomes, industry and market trends and the nature of each of the deferred tax assets in assessing the extent to which a valuation allowance should be applied against our U.S. deferred tax assets.39Results of Operations To enhance comparability, the following table sets forth our results of operations for the periods presented.

Our IT Operations Management solutions, which improve visibility, availability and agility of enterprise services, are generally priced on a per node basis. We expect subscription revenues for our IT Operations Management solutions to grow in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues in the year ended December 31, 2016. Professional services and other revenues increased $41.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the prior year, due to an increase in the services provided to our growing customer base. In addition, revenues from our annual Knowledge user conference increased to $10.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $8.2 million in the prior year due to increased sponsorship and paid registrations in the current year. We expect professional services and other revenues to grow at a slower rate compared to subscription revenues as we are increasingly focused on deploying our internal professional services organization as a strategic resource and relying on our partner ecosystem to contract directly with customers for service delivery.Our international operations have provided and will continue to provide a significant portion of our total revenues. Revenues outside North America represented 30% and 32% of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. As a result, the general strengthening of the U.S. Dollar relative to other major foreign currencies (primarily Euro) from the year ended December 31, 2014 to the year ended December 31, 2015 had an unfavorable impact on our revenues. For entities reporting in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar, if we had translated our results for the year ended December 31, 2015 at the exchange rates for the year ended December 31, 2014 rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the period, our subscription revenues would have increased by an additional $48.0 million and our professional services and other revenues would have increased by an additional $12.0 million.42Cost of Revenues and Gross Profit Percentage Year Ended December 31, % Change 2015 2014 (dollars in thousands) Cost of revenues: Subscription$183,400 $142,687 29%Professional services and other146,013 106,089 38%Total cost of revenues$329,413 $248,776 32%Gross profit percentage: Subscription78% 75% Professional services and other7% 8% Total gross profit percentage67% 63% Gross profit:$676,067 $433,787 56%Headcount (at period end) Subscription579 478 21%Professional services and other486 416 17%Total headcount1,065 894 19% Cost of subscription revenues increased $40.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the prior year, primarily due to increased headcount resulting in an increase of $11.2 million in personnel related costs excluding stock-based compensation, an increase of $8.4 million in stock-based compensation, an increase of $6.0 million in depreciation expense primarily due to purchases of cloud-based infrastructure hardware equipment for our data centers and an increase of $6.0 million in other overhead expenses. Data center capacity costs increased $1.0 million primarily due to the expansion of our data centers. Amortization of intangible assets increased $4.8 million as a result of the acquisition of Neebula Systems, Ltd., or Neebula, in July 2014. Our subscription gross profit percentage increased to 78% for the year ended December 31, 2015, from 75% for the year ended December 31, 2014, due to data center density and improved economies of scale. We expect our cost of subscription revenues to increase in absolute dollar terms as we provide subscription services to more customers and increase the number of users within our customer instances, but we expect such increase to be at a slower rate than the increase in our subscription revenue, leading to a slight increase in our subscription gross profit percentage for the year ended December 31, 2016 as we continue to leverage the investments we have made in our existing data center infrastructure. To the extent future acquisitions are consummated, our cost of subscription revenues may increase due to additional non-cash charges associated with the amortization of intangible assets acquired. Our forecast for revenues, cost of revenues and operating expenses was based on foreign exchange rates as of December 31, 2015.Cost of professional services and other revenues increased $39.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the prior year, primarily due to increased headcount resulting in an increase of $11.2 million in personnel related costs excluding stock-based compensation, an increase of $10.1 million in stock-based compensation, an increase of $5.3 million in overhead expenses, and an increase of $13.2 million in contracted third-party party costs.Our professional services and other gross profit percentage decreased to 7% during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 8% in the prior year due to increased stock-based compensation. The decrease in gross profit percentage was partially offset by the increase in revenues from our annual Knowledge user conference. Costs associated with Knowledge are included in sales and marketing expense. Knowledge contributed $10.9 million, or 7 percentage points to the professional services and other gross profit percentage for the year ended December 31, 2015. Knowledge contributed $8.2 million, or 7 percentage points to the professional services and other gross profit percentage for the year ended December 31, 2014.43The general strengthening of the U.S. Dollar relative to other major foreign currencies from the year ended December 31, 2014 to the year ended December 31, 2015 had an impact on our cost of revenues. For entities reporting in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar, if we had translated our results for the year ended December 31, 2015 at the exchange rates for the year ended December 31, 2014 rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the year ended December 31, 2015, our cost of subscription revenues would have increased by an additional $8.0 million and our cost of professional services and other revenues would have increased by an additional $7.8 million. Sales and Marketing Year Ended December 31 % Change 2015 2014 (dollars in thousands) Sales and marketing$498,439 $341,119 46%Percentage of revenues50% 50% Headcount (at period end)1,416 1,011 40% Sales and marketing expenses increased $157.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the prior year, primarily due to increased headcount that resulted in an increase of $57.7 million in personnel related costs excluding stock-based compensation, an increase of $48.3 million in stock-based compensation, an increase of $19.0 million in overhead expenses, and an increase of $15.3 million in commission expense. Commissions and referral fee expenses amounted to 8% and 10% of subscription revenues for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. In addition, expenses related to our annual Knowledge user conference increased $5.7 million, from $15.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 to $21.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, due to a 31% increase in attendance year-over-year. All other marketing program expenses, which include events, advertising and market data, increased $10.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the prior year.The general strengthening of the U.S. Dollar relative to other major foreign currencies from the year ended December 31, 2014 to the year ended December 31, 2015 had an impact on our sales and marketing expenses. For entities reporting in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar, if we had translated our results for the year ended December 31, 2015 at the exchange rates for the year ended December 31, 2014 rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the period, our sales and marketing expenses would have increased by an additional $20.9 million.We expect sales and marketing expenses to increase for the year ended December 31, 2016 in absolute dollar terms, but remain relatively flat as a percentage of total revenues as we continue to expand our direct sales force, increase our marketing activities, grow our international operations, build brand awareness and sponsor additional marketing events.Research and Development Year Ended December 31 % Change 2015 2014 (dollars in thousands) Research and development$217,389 $148,258 47%Percentage of revenues22% 22% Headcount (at period end)756 585 29% Research and development expenses increased $69.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the prior year, primarily due to increased headcount which resulted in an increase of $27.8 million in stock-based compensation, an increase of $25.4 million in personnel related costs excluding stock-based compensation, and an increase of $10.6 million in overhead expenses. Research and development expenses also increased $3.5 million due to an increase in data center capacity costs and depreciation of cloud-based infrastructure hardware equipment that are used solely for research and development purposes. 44The general strengthening of the U.S. Dollar relative to other major foreign currencies from the year ended December 31, 2014 to the year ended December 31, 2015 had an impact on our research and development expenses. For entities reporting in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar, if we had translated our results for the year ended December 31, 2015 at the exchange rates for the year ended December 31, 2014 rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the year ended December 31, 2015, our research and development expenses would have increased by an additional $4.2 million. We expect research and development expenses to increase for the year ended December 31, 2016 in absolute dollar terms, but remain relatively flat as a percentage of total revenues as we continue to improve the existing functionality of our services, develop new applications to fill market needs and continue to enhance our core platform. General and Administrative Year Ended December 31 % Change 2015 2014 (dollars in thousands) General and administrative$126,604 $96,245 32%Percentage of revenues12% 14% Headcount (at period end)449 336 34% General and administrative expenses increased $30.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the prior year, primarily due to an increase of $14.2 million in outside services primarily driven by an increase in legal fees associated with our litigation and an increase in the number of contractors to support our administrative functions. In addition, stock-based compensation increased $8.7 million, and personnel related costs excluding stock-based compensation increased $7.4 million, primarily driven by the increased headcount. The impact from the foreign currency movements from the year ended December 31, 2014 to the year ended December 31, 2015 is not material to general and administrative expenses.We expect general and administrative expenses to increase for the year ended December 31, 2016 in absolute dollar terms as we continue to hire people and incur costs associated with our litigations, but remain flat as a percentage of total revenues as we continue to grow. This includes anticipated attorney’s fees and expenses for our outstanding litigations with BMC and HPE, but not any forecast related to their outcomes. The trials are currently scheduled for March 2016 and May 2017, respectively. Refer to “Legal Proceedings” in Item 3 of this filing for details on the litigation matters. Stock-based Compensation Year Ended December 31 % Change 2015 2014 (dollars in thousands) Cost of revenues: Subscription$23,416 $14,988 56%Professional services and other23,265 13,116 77%Sales and marketing102,349 54,006 90%Research and development70,326 42,535 65%General and administrative38,357 29,674 29%Total stock-based compensation$257,713 $154,319 67%Percentage of revenues26% 23% 45Stock-based compensation increased $103.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the prior year, primarily due to additional annual grants of equity incentive awards, increased headcount, an increase in the weighted-average grant date fair value of stock awards, and performance RSUs granted to our executives in the current year. The new equity incentive awards granted in the current year, including the performance RSUs, resulted in an increase of $102.1 million in stock-based compensation. The weighted-average grant date exercise price per stock option share was $75.76 and $61.40 for the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The weighted-average grant date fair value per restricted stock unit was $73.98 and $61.13 for the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Stock-based compensation is inherently difficult to forecast due to fluctuations in our stock price and the uncertainty around the achievement of performance criteria associated with our performance RSUs. We expect stock-based compensation to continue to increase for the year ended December 31, 2016 in absolute dollar terms, but remain relatively flat as a percentage of total revenues as we continue to grow. Interest Expense Year Ended December 31 % Change 2015 2014 (dollars in thousands) Interest expense$(31,097) $(29,059) 7%Percentage of revenues(3)% (3)% Interest expense increased $2.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the prior year, due to the increase in amortization expense of debt discount and issuance costs related to our convertible senior notes, or the ""Notes"" issued in November 2013. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we expect to incur approximately $33.3 million in amortization expense of debt discount and issuance costs related to the Notes. Interest Income and Other Income (Expense), net Year Ended December 31 % Change 2015 2014 (dollars in thousands) Interest income$4,749 $2,964 60 %Foreign currency exchange gain (loss)51 2,490 (98)%Other(350) (100) 250 %Interest income and other income (expense), net$4,450 $5,354 (17)%Percentage of revenues1% 1% Interest income and other expense, net, decreased $0.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the prior year, primarily due to a lower foreign currency gain, partially offset by increased interest income. Our foreign currency exchange gain decreased $2.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the prior year primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar against other major currencies and an increase in our foreign operations. Interest income increased $1.8 million due to the higher investment balances during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the prior year.Our expanding international operations will continue to increase our exposure to currency risks, though we cannot presently predict the impact of this exposure on our consolidated financial statements. While we have not engaged in the hedging of our foreign currency transactions to date, we are conducting an ongoing evaluation of the costs and benefits of initiating such a program and in the future may hedge selected significant transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. 46 Provision for Income Taxes Year Ended December 31 % Change 2015 2014 (dollars in thousands) Loss before income taxes$(193,012) $(175,540) 10%Provision for income taxes5,414 3,847 41%Effective tax rate(3)% (2)% Our effective tax rate was (3)% for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to (2)% for the prior year. Our tax expense increased $1.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the prior year, primarily due to a higher proportion of taxable earnings in foreign jurisdictions. See Note 15 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for our reconciliation of income taxes at the statutory federal rate to the provision for income taxes.We continue to maintain a full valuation allowance on our U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets, and the significant components of the tax expense recorded are current cash taxes in various jurisdictions. The cash tax expenses are impacted by each jurisdiction’s individual tax rates, laws on timing of recognition of income and deductions, and availability of net operating losses and tax credits. Given the full valuation allowance, sensitivity of current cash taxes to local rules and our foreign structuring, we expect our effective tax rate could fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis and could be adversely affected to the extent earnings are lower than anticipated in countries that have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher statutory rates. We consider the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the United States.Net Loss Year Ended December 31 % Change 2015 2014 (dollars in thousands) Net loss$(198,426) $(179,387) 11%Percentage of revenues(20)% (26)% Net loss increased $19.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the prior year as the growth in our expenses, particularly stock-based compensation, exceeded our revenue growth. We expect to continue to incur a GAAP loss for the year ended December 31, 2016, due to increased costs and expenses, including increased non-cash charges associated with equity awards and amortization of intangibles and other expenses. 47Comparison of the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 Revenues Year Ended December 31, % Change 2014 2013 (dollars in thousands) Revenues: Subscription$567,217 $349,804 62%Professional services and other115,346 74,846 54%Total revenues$682,563 $424,650 61%Percentage of revenues: Subscription83% 82% Professional services and other17 18 Total100% 100% Subscription revenues increased $217.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to the prior year, driven by our upsells, renewals and an increase in our customer count.

Data center capacity costs increased $5.4 million primarily due to the expansion of our data centers. Amortization of intangible assets increased $5.4 million as a result of the acquisition of Neebula in July 2014. Our subscription gross profit percentage was 75% for each of the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013.Cost of professional services and other revenues increased $38.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the prior year, primarily due to increased headcount resulting in an increase of $21.6 million in personnel related costs excluding stock-based compensation, an increase of $8.4 million in stock-based compensation, an increase of $3.2 million in overhead expenses, and an increase of $6.0 million in contracted third-party vendor costs.Our professional services and other gross profit percentage decreased to 8% during the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to 10% in the prior year due to increased stock-based compensation. The decrease in gross profit percentage was partially offset by the increase in revenues from our annual Knowledge user conference. Costs associated with Knowledge are included in sales and marketing expense. Knowledge contributed $8.2 million, or 7 percentage points to the professional services and other gross profit percentage for the year ended December 31, 2014.

The new equity incentive awards granted in the current year, including the performance RSUs, resulted in an increase of $75.1 million in stock-based compensation. The weighted-average grant date exercise price per stock option share was $61.40 and $38.07 for the year ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The weighted-average grant date fair value per restricted stock unit was $61.13 and $38.15 for the year ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. In addition, stock-based compensation increased $19.9 million related to equity incentive awards granted in the prior year, for which a partial year of expense was recognized in the prior year and $2.4 million related to increased participation in our employee stock purchase plan. The increase in stock-based compensation was partially offset by stock awards forfeited in the current year and stock awards fully vesting in the current year.

Quarterly Results of Operations The following table sets forth our unaudited quarterly consolidated statements of operations. We have prepared the quarterly data on a consistent basis with the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In the opinion of management, the financial information reflects all necessary adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair statement of this data. This information should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The results of historical periods are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for a full year or any future period.52 For the Three Months Ended Dec 31,2015 Sep 30,2015 June 30,2015 March 31,2015 Dec 31,2014 Sep 30,2014 June 30,2014 March 31,2014 (in thousands, except per share data)Revenues: Subscription$244,702 $223,208 $200,461 $179,907 $166,751 $150,367 $132,724 $117,375Professional services and other40,948 37,942 46,255 32,057 31,253 28,345 34,033 21,715Total revenues285,650 261,150 246,716 211,964 198,004 178,712 166,757 139,090Cost of revenues: Subscription49,511 46,053 45,392 42,444 40,330 37,925 33,243 31,189Professional services and other41,398 35,835 34,325 34,455 30,308 28,161 25,695 21,925Total cost of revenues90,909 81,888 79,717 76,899 70,638 66,086 58,938 53,114Gross profit194,741 179,262 166,999 135,065 127,366 112,626 107,819 85,976Operating expenses: Sales and marketing133,909 117,899 136,574 110,057 95,764 84,002 91,937 69,416Research and development58,443 55,822 53,276 49,848 42,026 39,683 35,439 31,110General and administrative33,247 33,581 30,384 29,392 26,260 23,440 24,914 21,631Total operating expenses225,599 207,302 220,234 189,297 164,050 147,125 152,290 122,157Loss from operations(30,858) (28,040) (53,235) (54,232) (36,684) (34,499) (44,471) (36,181)Interest expense(7,973) (7,839) (7,707) (7,578) (7,451) (7,325) (7,202) (7,081)Interest income and other income (expense), net3,177 (3,952) 521 4,704 889 1,376 1,971 1,118Loss before provision for income taxes(35,654) (39,831) (60,421) (57,106) (43,246) (40,448) (49,702) (42,144)Provision for income taxes1,724 1,199 1,504 987 1,417 602 661 1,167Net loss$(37,378) $(41,030) $(61,925) $(58,093) $(44,663) $(41,050) $(50,363) $(43,311)Net loss attributable to common stockholders - basic and diluted$(37,378) $(41,030) $(61,925) $(58,093) $(44,663) $(41,050) $(50,363) $(43,311)Net loss per share attributable to common stockholders - basic and diluted$(0.23) $(0.26) $(0.40) $(0.38) $(0.30) $(0.28) $(0.35) $(0.30)53Seasonality, Cyclicality and Quarterly Trends We have historically experienced seasonality in terms of when we enter into customer agreements for our services. We sign a significantly higher percentage of agreements with new customers, as well as renewal agreements with existing customers, in the quarter ended December 31. The increase in customer agreements for the quarter ended December 31 is primarily a result of the terms of our commission plans to incentivize our direct sales force to meet their quotas by December 31 and large enterprise account buying patterns typical in the software industry. Furthermore, we usually sign a significant portion of these agreements during the last month, and often the last two weeks, of each quarter. This seasonality in our billings, is reflected to a much lesser extent, and sometimes is not immediately apparent, in our revenues, due to the fact that we recognize subscription revenues over the term of the license agreement, which is generally 12 to 36 months. Although these seasonal factors are common in the technology industry, historical patterns should not be considered a reliable indicator of our future sales activity or performance. Our revenues have increased over the periods presented due to increased sales to new customers, as well as upsells to existing customers. We have historically seen an increase in professional services and other revenues in the quarter ended June 30, and a corresponding decrease in professional services and other revenues in the quarter ended September 30 due to the revenues earned from our annual Knowledge user conference that occurs in the quarter ended June 30. Our operating expenses have increased over the periods presented primarily due to increases in headcount and other related expenses to support our growth. We have historically seen an increase in marketing expenses in the quarter ended June 30, and a corresponding decrease in marketing expenses in the quarter ended September 30 due to the expenses incurred for our annual Knowledge user conference. Marketing expenses in the quarter ended December 31 are also historically higher due to customer forums we conduct in that quarter. We anticipate operating expenses will continue to increase in future periods as we continue to focus on investing in the long-term growth of our business. Liquidity and Capital Resources Year Ended December 31, 2015 2014 2013 (dollars in thousands)Net cash provided by operating activities$315,091$138,900 $81,746Net cash used in investing activities(231,743)(316,928) (402,795)Net cash provided by financing activities82,99370,772 568,570Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents, net of impact of exchange rates on cash159,850(113,848) 247,314 Our principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents, investments, and cash generated from operations. As of December 31, 2015, we had $801.3 million in cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, of which $92.3 million represented cash owned by foreign subsidiaries. In addition, we had $422.7 million in long-term investments which provide additional capital resources.In November 2013, we issued Notes with an aggregate principal amount of $575.0 million and concurrently entered into a hedge, or Note Hedge, and warrant transaction, or Warrants. The net proceeds of this debt issuance are being used for general corporate purposes, including potential acquisitions and strategic transactions. The Warrants are exercisable at a strike price of $107.46 per share. Upon conversion of the Notes, we may choose to pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock. As of December 31, 2015, the Notes were not convertible. We anticipate our current cash and cash equivalents balance and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs including the expansion of data centers, lease obligations, expenditures related to the growth of our headcount and the acquisition of fixed assets and investments in office facilities to accommodate our growth for at least the next 12 months. Whether these resources are adequate to meet our liquidity needs beyond that period will depend on our growth, operating results, cash utilized for acquisitions, if any are consummated, and the capital expenditures required to meet possible increased demand for our services. If we require additional capital resources to grow our business at any time in the future, we may seek to finance our operations from the current funds available or seek additional equity or debt financing. Operating Activities Cash provided by operating activities mainly consists of net loss adjusted for certain non-cash items, including depreciation and amortization, amortization of issuance cost and debt discount, stock-based compensation, tax benefits from employee stock plans and changes in operating assets and liabilities during the year.54Net cash provided by operating activities was $315.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $138.9 million for the prior year. The increase in operating cash flow was primarily due to an increased net loss offset by a substantial increase in non-cash adjustments to reconcile net loss to net cash provided by operations and the favorable impact on operating cash flow from changes in operating assets and liabilities. Net cash flow from the aggregate of changes in accounts receivable, deferred commissions and deferred revenue increased due to increased sales for the year ended December 31, 2015. Net cash flows from the aggregate of changes in accrued liabilities, accounts payable and prepaid expenses increased due to the growth of our business and increased headcount of 30% for the year ended December 31, 2015, as well as timing of our cash payments.Net cash provided by operating activities was $138.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $81.7 million for the prior year. The increase in operating cash flow was primarily due to an increased net loss offset by a substantial increase in non-cash adjustments to reconcile net loss to net cash provided by operations and the favorable impact on operating cash flow from changes in operating assets and liabilities. Net cash flow from the aggregate of changes in accounts receivable, deferred commissions and deferred revenue increased due to increased sales for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in net cash flows from the aggregate of changes in accrued liabilities, accounts payable and prepaid expenses due to the growth of our business and increased headcount of 54% for the year ended December 31, 2014. Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $231.7 million compared to $316.9 million for the prior year. The decrease in cash used in investing activities was mainly due to the $32.0 million decrease in the net purchases of investments and the $98.7 million decrease in cash used for acquisitions, offset by the $33.1 million increase in capital expenditures related to the purchase of cloud-based infrastructure hardware equipment to support the expansion of our data centers as well as investments in leasehold improvements, furniture and equipment to support our headcount growth, and the $10.5 million increase in the purchases of strategic investments.Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $316.9 million compared to $402.8 million for the prior year. The decrease in cash used in investing activities was mainly due to a decrease in the net purchases of investments of $171.3 million. The decrease was offset by an increase of $86.5 million in acquisition activity due to the Neebula acquisition in 2014. Financing Activities Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $83.0 million compared to $70.8 million for the prior year. The increase in cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to the $24.0 million increase in proceeds from employee stock plans, offset by the $12.1 million increase in taxes paid related to net share settlement of equity awards. Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $70.8 million compared to $568.6 million for the prior year. The decrease in cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to net proceeds of $511.7 million from issuance of the Notes and Warrants and purchase of the Note Hedge in 2013. The decrease was offset by $13.2 million increase in proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options and the Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or ESPP and related tax benefit. 55Contractual Obligations and Commitments Contractual obligations represent future cash commitments and liabilities under agreements with third parties, and exclude orders for goods and services entered into in the normal course of business that are not enforceable or legally binding. The following table represents our known contractual obligations as of December 31, 2015, aggregated by type: Payments Due by Period Total LessThan1 Year 1 – 3Years 3 – 5Years MoreThan5 Years (in thousands)Operating leases: Data centers$39,375 $17,249 $13,226 $5,138 $3,762Office leases, net of sublease income277,478 24,715 58,216 57,136 137,411Convertible Senior Notes575,000 — 575,000 — —Other4,523 512 1,024 1,024 1,963Total contractual obligations$896,376 $42,476 $647,466 $63,298 $143,136In addition to the obligations in the table above, approximately $2.6 million of unrecognized tax benefits have been recorded as liabilities as of December 31, 2015. It is uncertain as to if or when such amounts may be settled. We have also recorded a liability for potential penalties of $0.2 million and interest of $0.3 million related to these unrecognized tax benefits.Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements During all periods presented, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. As such, we are not exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in those types of relationships. Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates Our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. These items are monitored and analyzed by us for changes in facts and circumstances, and material changes in these estimates could occur in the future. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Changes in estimates are reflected in reported results for the period in which they become known. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions and such differences could be material. While our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe that the following accounting policies are critical to the process of making significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our audited consolidated financial statements. Revenue RecognitionWe derive our revenues from two sources: (i) subscriptions and (ii) professional services and other. Subscription revenues are primarily comprised of subscription fees that give customers access to the ordered subscription service, related support and updates, if any, to the subscribed service during the subscription term.Our contracts typically do not give the customer the right to take possession of the software supporting the services. Professional services and other revenues consist of fees associated with the implementation and configuration of our services. Professional services and other revenues also include customer training and attendance and sponsorship fees for Knowledge, our annual user conference.56We commence revenue recognition when all of the following conditions are met:•There is persuasive evidence of an arrangement;•The service has been provided to the customer;•The collection of related fees is reasonably assured; and•The amount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable.We use a signed contract together with a signed order form or a purchase order, as evidence of an arrangement for a new customer. In subsequent transactions with an existing customer, including an upsell or a renewal, we consider the existing signed contract and either the new signed order form or new purchase order as evidence of an arrangement.We recognize subscription revenues ratably over the contract term beginning on the commencement date of each contract, the date we make our services available to our customers. Once our services are available to customers, we record amounts due in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue. We price professional services primarily on a time-and-materials basis and recognize professional services revenues as the services are delivered using a proportional performance model. Such services are delivered over a short period of time. In instances where final acceptance of the services are required before revenues are recognized, we defer professional services revenues and the associated costs until all acceptance criteria have been met.We assess collectibility based on a number of factors such as past collection history with the customer and creditworthiness of the customer. If we determine collectibility is not reasonably assured, we defer revenue recognition until collectibility becomes reasonably assured. We assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment. Our arrangements are generally non-cancelable and do not contain refund-type provisions.We have multiple element arrangements comprised of subscription fees and professional services. We account for subscription and professional services revenues as separate units of accounting. To qualify as a separate unit of accounting, the delivered item must have value to the customer on a standalone basis. We have concluded that our subscription service has standalone value as it is routinely sold separately by us. In addition, the applications offered through this subscription service are fully functional without any additional development, modification or customization. We provide customers access to our subscription service at the beginning of the contract term. In determining whether professional services have standalone value, we considered the following factors for each professional services agreement: availability of the services from other vendors, the nature of the professional services, the timing of when the professional services contract was signed in comparison to the subscription service start date and the contractual dependence of the subscription service on the customer’s satisfaction with the professional services work. Our professional services, including implementation and configuration services, are not so unique and complex that other vendors cannot provide them. In some instances, customers independently contract with third-party vendors to do the implementation and we regularly outsource implementation services to contracted third-party vendors. As a result, we concluded professional services, including implementation and configuration services, have standalone value.The total arrangement consideration for a multiple element arrangement is allocated to the identifiable separate units of accounting based on a relative selling price hierarchy. We determined the relative selling price for a deliverable based on its vendor-specific objective evidence, or VSOE, of selling price or third-party evidence, or TPE, of selling price if VSOE does not exist. If neither VSOE nor TPE of selling price exists for a deliverable, the selling price is determined using the best estimate of selling price, or BESP. We determine the BESP for each deliverable primarily by considering the historical selling price of these deliverables in similar transactions as well as other factors, including, but not limited to, market competition, review of stand-alone sales and current pricing practices. In determining the appropriate pricing structure, we consider the available information regarding the competitive pricing of similar products and marketing analysis.In limited circumstances, we grant certain customers the right to deploy our subscription service on the customers’ own servers without significant penalty. These arrangements are subject to software revenue recognition guidance since the customer deploys our software. We have analyzed all of the elements in these particular multiple element arrangements and determined that we do not have sufficient VSOE of fair value to allocate revenue to our subscription service and professional services. Consequently, we defer all revenue and related costs under the arrangement until the last element in the transaction has been delivered or started to be delivered. Once the subscription service and the professional services have commenced, we recognize the entire fee and related costs from the arrangement ratably over the remaining period of the arrangement.Deferred revenue consists primarily of payments received in advance of revenue recognition for our subscriptions and professional services and other revenues and is recognized as the revenue recognition criteria are met.57Deferred Commissions Deferred commissions are the incremental selling costs that are directly associated with our customer contracts and consist of sales commissions paid to our direct sales force and referral fees paid to independent third-parties. The majority of commissions and referral fees are deferred and amortized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the related customer contracts. We include amortization of deferred commissions in sales and marketing expense in the consolidated statements of comprehensive loss. We believe this is the preferable method of accounting as the commission charges are so closely related to the revenue from the customer contracts that they should be recorded as an asset and charged to expense over the same period that the revenue is recognized. The commission payments are paid in full the month after the customer’s service commences. Goodwill, Intangible Assets and Other Long Lived AssetsGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price in a business combination over the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired. We evaluate and test the recoverability of goodwill for impairment at least annually, during our fourth quarter, or more frequently if circumstances indicate that goodwill may not be recoverable. We perform the impairment testing by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of its reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we perform a two-step impairment test. The first step requires the identification of the reporting units and comparison of the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an indication of goodwill impairment exists for the reporting unit and the second step of the impairment test is performed to compute the amount of the impairment. Under the second step, an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit's goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill. We have determined that we have a single reporting unit. Since the aggregate fair value of our company has consistently and materially exceeded the carrying value of our single reporting unit, we did not recognize any impairment charges related to goodwill during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.Intangible assets are amortized over their useful lives ranging from 18 months to 10 years. Each period we evaluate the estimated remaining useful life of purchased intangible assets to determine whether events or changes in circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization. We periodically review the carrying amounts of these assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable. We measure the recoverability of these assets by comparing the carrying amount of each asset to the future undiscounted cash flows we expect the asset to generate. If we consider any of these assets to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized equals the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. Screening for and assessing whether impairment indicators exist or if events or changes in circumstances have occurred, including market conditions, operating fundamentals, competition and general economic conditions, requires significant judgment. Additionally, changes in the technology industry occur frequently and quickly. Therefore, there can be no assurance that a charge to operating expenses will not occur as a result of future goodwill, intangible assets and other long-lived assets impairment tests. Stock-based Compensation We recognize compensation expense related to stock options and restricted stock units, or RSUs, on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting term of four years. For RSUs granted with a performance condition, the expenses are recognized on a graded vesting basis over the vesting period, after assessing the probability of achieving requisite performance criteria. This has the impact of greater stock-based compensation expense during the initial years of the vesting period as stock-based compensation cost is recognized over the requisite service period for each separately vesting tranche of the award as though the award were, in substance, multiple awards. We recognize compensation expense related to shares issued pursuant to the ESPP, on a straight-line basis over the offering period. We estimate the fair value of options using the Black-Scholes options pricing model and fair value of RSU awards using the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant. We recognize compensation expense net of estimated forfeiture activity, which is based on historical forfeiture rates. We evaluate the forfeiture rates at least annually, or when events or circumstances indicate a change may be needed. This may cause a fluctuation in our stock-based compensation in the period of change. 58Income Taxes We use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes, in which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. We measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be reversed. We recognize the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates as income and expense in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is established if it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. In determining the need for a valuation allowance, we consider future growth, forecasted earnings, future taxable income, the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate, historical earnings, taxable income in prior years, if carryback is permitted under the law, carry-forward periods, and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies.Our tax positions are subject to income tax audits by multiple tax jurisdictions throughout the world. We recognize the tax benefit of an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not the position is sustainable upon examination by the taxing authority, based on the technical merits. We measure the tax benefit recognized as the largest amount of benefit which is more likely than not to be realized upon settlement with the taxing authority. We recognize interest accrued and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in our tax provision. Significant judgment is required to evaluate uncertain tax positions. Our evaluations are based upon a number of factors, including changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law or guidance, correspondence with tax authorities during the course of audits and effective settlement of audit issues. Changes in the recognition or measurement of uncertain tax positions could result in material increases or decreases in our income tax expense in the period in which we make the change, which could have a material impact on our effective tax rate and operating results.We calculate the current and deferred income tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed in subsequent years and record adjustments based on filed income tax returns when identified. The amount of income taxes paid is subject to examination by U.S. federal, state and foreign tax authorities. The estimate of the potential outcome of any uncertain tax issue is subject to management’s assessment of relevant risks, facts and circumstances existing at that time. To the extent the assessment of such tax position changes, we record the change in estimate in the period in which we make the determination. Recent Accounting PronouncementsIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued an update to ASC 606 Revenue from Contracts with Customers, or ASC 606, that will supersede virtually all existing revenue guidance. Under this update, an entity is required to recognize revenue upon transfer of promised goods or services to customers, in an amount that reflects the expected consideration received in exchange for those goods or services. As such, an entity will need to use more judgment and make more estimates than under the current guidance. This update should be applied retrospectively either to each prior reporting period presented in the financial statements, or only to the most current reporting period presented in the financial statements with a cumulative effect adjustment recorded in the retained earnings. This update is effective for our interim and annual reporting periods beginning January 1, 2018. Early adoption is permitted for us on January 1, 2017. We are currently evaluating the impact of this update on our consolidated financial statements.In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03, Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs. To simplify presentation of debt issuance costs, this new guidance requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. This guidance will become effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015 and interim periods within those fiscal years. We elected to early adopt this accounting guidance as of December 31, 2015 on a retrospective basis. As a result of the adoption, we reclassified unamortized debt issuance costs of $0.2 million and $0.3 million as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, from ""Other assets"" and reflected them as a reduction in ""Convertible senior notes, net ""on the consolidated balance sheets. Adoption of this guidance did not impact our consolidated statements of comprehensive loss or consolidated statements of cash flows.In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-05, Intangibles—Goodwill and Other—Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer’s Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement. ASU 2015-05 provides guidance to customers about whether a cloud computing arrangement includes software. If a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license, the customer should account for the software license element of the arrangement consistent with the acquisition of other software licenses. If a cloud computing arrangement does not include a software license, the customer should account for the arrangement as a service contract. The new guidance does not change the customer’s accounting for service contracts. This guidance is effective for our interim and annual reporting periods beginning January 1, 2016. We are currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on our consolidated financial statements.59In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-16, Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments (Topic 805), which eliminates the requirement to restate prior period financial statements for measurement period adjustments. ASU 2015-16 requires that the cumulative impact of a measurement period adjustment (including the impact on prior periods) be recognized in the reporting period in which the adjustment is identified. The new standard is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015 and early adoption is permitted. This ASU is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements or disclosures as we do not have any business combinations within the measurement period.In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes. To simplify presentation, the new guidance requires that all deferred tax assets and liabilities, along with any related valuation allowance, be classified as non-current on the balance sheet. As a result, each jurisdiction will now only have one net non-current deferred tax asset or liability. This guidance will become effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016 and interim periods within those fiscal years, and may be applied either prospectively to all deferred tax liabilities and assets or retrospectively to all periods presented. Early adoption is permitted. We elected to early adopt this accounting guidance during the three months ended December 31, 2015 on a prospective basis, resulting in the reclassification of current deferred tax assets to noncurrent deferred tax liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets, which decreased $15.5 million of ""Other current assets"" and $15.2 million of ""Other long-term liabilities"", and increased $0.3 million of ""Other assets"". Prior periods were not retrospectively adjusted.60ITEM 7A.QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Foreign Currency Exchange Risk We have foreign currency risks related to our revenue and operating expenses denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar, primarily the Euro and British Pound Sterling. We are a net receiver of Euro and therefore are adversely affected by a strengthening of the U.S. Dollar relative to the Euro. Revenues denominated in U.S. Dollar as a percentage of total revenue was 74%, 72% and 77% during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Changes in exchange rates have recently and may continue to negatively affect our total revenues. We have experienced and expect to continue to experience fluctuations in our net loss as a result of transaction gains or losses related to remeasuring monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entities in which they are recorded. We recognized a net foreign currency gain of $0.1 million and $2.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. While we have not engaged in the hedging of our foreign currency transactions to date, we may do so in the future.A hypothetical 10% decrease in the U.S. Dollar against other currencies would result in an approximately $2.4 million decrease and $3.5 million increase in operating loss for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. This analysis disregards the possibilities that rates can move in opposite directions and that losses from one geographic area may be offset by gains from another geographic area. Interest Rate Sensitivity We had an aggregate of $1.2 billion in cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and long-term investments at December 31, 2015. This amount was invested primarily in money market funds, time deposits, corporate notes and bonds, government securities and other debt securities with a minimum rating of BBB by Standard & Poor's. Baa2 by Moody's or BBB by Fitch. The primary objectives of our investment activities are the preservation of capital and support of our liquidity requirements. Our investments are exposed to market risk due to fluctuations in interest rates, which may affect our interest income and the fair market value of our investments. As of December 31, 2015, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would have resulted in an approximate $7.4 million decline of the fair value of our available-for-sale securities. This estimate is based on a sensitivity model that measures market value changes when changes in interest rates occur.As of December 31, 2014, we had an aggregate of $0.9 billion in cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and long-term investments, and a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would have resulted in an approximate $5.6 million decline of the fair value of our available-for-sale securities. Market RiskIn November 2013, we issued Notes with an aggregate principal amount of $575.0 million. We carry this instrument at face value less unamortized discount on our consolidated balance sheet. Because this instrument does not bear interest, we have no financial statement risk associated with changes in interest rates. However, the fair value of fixed rate instruments fluctuate when interest rates change, and in the case of convertible notes, when the market price of our stock fluctuates.We hold cash balances with multiple financial institutions in various countries and these balances routinely exceed deposit insurance limits.During the year ended December 31, 2015, we invested $10.5 million in privately-held companies that are in the development stage. The fair value of these investments may fluctuate depending on the financial condition and near-term prospects of these companies, and we may be required to record an impairment charge if the carrying value of these investments exceed their fair value. 61",2023-12-30 18:26:52.614215
1373715,NOW,"ServiceNow, Inc.",2017,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes appearing under ""Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data"" in Item 8 of this filing. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this filing, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. You should carefully read the ""Risk Factors” section of this filing for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results and the timing of certain events to differ materially from future results expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.Our billings and free cash flow measures included in the sections entitled “—Key Business Metrics—Billings,” “—Key Business Metrics—Free Cash Flow,” and “—Seasonality, Cyclicality and Quarterly Trends"" are not in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). These non-GAAP financial measures are not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. These measures may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, limiting their usefulness for comparison purposes. We believe investors should consider these non-GAAP financial measures in evaluating our results as they are indicative of our ongoing performance and reflect how management evaluates our operational results and trends. 25Overview ServiceNow is a leading provider of enterprise cloud computing solutions that define, structure, manage and automate services for global enterprises. Our mission is to help our customers improve service levels and reduce costs while scaling and automating their businesses. We offer our services on an annual subscription fee basis which includes access to the ordered subscription service and related support including updates to the subscribed service during the subscription term. We provide a scaled pricing model based on the duration of the subscription term and we frequently extend discounts to our customers based on the number of users. We generate sales through our direct sales team and, to a lesser extent, indirectly through channel partners and third-party referrals. We also generate revenues from professional services for implementation and configuration services and for training of customer and partner personnel. We generally bill our customers annually in advance for subscription services and monthly in arrears for our professional services as the work is performed. A majority of our revenues come from large global enterprise customers. We continue to invest in the development of our services, infrastructure and sales and marketing to drive long-term growth. We increased our overall employee headcount to 4,801 as of December 31, 2016 from 3,686 as of December 31, 2015.Key Business Metrics Number of customers with ACV greater than $1 million. We count the total number of customers with annualized contract value (ACV) greater than $1 million as of the end of the period. We had 341, 227 and 157 customers with ACV greater than $1 million as of December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. For purposes of customer count, a customer is defined as an entity with a unique Dunn & Bradstreet Global Ultimate (GULT), Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) and an active subscription contract as of the measurement date. The DUNS number is a global standard for business identification and tracking. We make exceptions for holding companies, government entities and other organizations for which the GULT, in our judgment, does not accurately represent the ServiceNow customer. For example, while all U.S. government agencies roll up to ""Government of the United States"" under the GULT, we count each government agency that we contract with as a separate customer. Our customer count is subject to adjustments for acquisitions, spin-offs and other market activity. Previously disclosed number of customers with ACV greater than $1 million as well as our average contract term calculations are restated to allow for comparability. ACV is calculated based on the foreign exchange rate in effect at the time the contract was entered into. Foreign exchange rate fluctuations could cause some variability in the number of customers with ACV greater than $1 million. G2K customer count. The Global 2000 (G2K) customer count is defined as the total number of G2K companies in our customer base as of the end of the period. The Forbes Global 2000 is an annual ranking of the top 2,000 public companies in the world by Forbes magazine. The ranking is based on a mix of four metrics: sales, profit, assets, and market value. The Forbes Global 2000 is updated annually in the second quarter of the calendar year. Current and prior period G2K customer counts are based on the most recent list for comparability purposes. We adjust the G2K count for acquisitions, spin-offs and other market activity to ensure the G2K customer count is accurately captured. For example, we add a G2K customer when a G2K company that is not our customer acquires a company in our existing customer base that is not a G2K company. When we enter into a contract with a G2K parent company, or any of its related subsidiaries, or any combination of entities within a G2K company, we count only one G2K customer. We do not count further penetration into entities within a given G2K as a new customer in the G2K customer count. Our G2K customer count also excludes customers that have only purchased our Express product offering, which is our entry-level IT service management solution.Our G2K customer count was 735, 633 and 533 as of December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Average ACV per G2K customer. We calculate average ACV for our G2K customers by taking cumulative ACV from G2K customers as of the end of the period divided by cumulative count of G2K customers as of the end of the period. Foreign currency rate fluctuations could cause variability in the average ACV per G2K customer. Our average ACV per G2K customer was approximately $1.1 million, $0.9 million and $0.7 million as of December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.26Renewal rate. We calculate our renewal rate by subtracting our attrition rate from 100%. Our attrition rate for a period is equal to the ACV from lost customers, divided by the total ACV from all customers that renewed during the period, excluding changes in price or users, and total ACV from all lost customers. Accordingly, our renewal rate is a calculation based on ACV and is not based on the number of customers that have renewed. A lost customer is a customer that did not renew an expiring contract and that, in our judgment, will not be renewed. Typically, a customer that reduces its subscription upon renewal is not considered a lost customer. However, in instances where the subscription decrease represents the majority of the customer's ACV, we may deem the renewal as a lost customer. For our renewal rate calculation, we define a customer as an entity with a separate production instance of our service and an active subscription contract as of the measurement date, instead of an entity with a unique GULT or DUNS number. Our renewal rate was 98% for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 and 97% for the year ended December 31, 2014. As renewal rate is impacted by the timing of renewals, which could occur in advance of, or subsequent to the original contract end date, period-to-period comparison of renewal rates may not be meaningful.Billings. We define billings as revenue recognized plus the change in total deferred revenue as presented on the consolidated statements of cash flows. The change in total deferred revenue as presented on the consolidated statements of cash flows represent the change in deferred revenues in local currencies translated into U.S. dollars using an average foreign currency exchange rate, and aligns actual billings with the exchange rates in effect at the time of the billings. We believe billings is a useful leading indicator regarding the performance of our business. A calculation of billings is provided below: Year Ended December 31, 2016 2015 2014 (dollars in thousands)Billings: Total revenues$1,390,513 $1,005,480 $682,563Change in deferred revenue from the consolidated statements of cash flows300,167 195,900 168,393Total billings$1,690,680 $1,201,380 $850,956Year-over-year percentage change in total billings41% 41% 64%Billings consists of amounts invoiced for contracts with new customers, upsells, renewals, backlog, professional services, training, and our Knowledge and other customer forum events. While we typically bill customers annually for our subscription services, customers sometimes request, and we accommodate, billings durations that differ from the typical twelve month term. In addition, from time to time we enter into contracts with a contract start date in the future, and we exclude these amounts from billings as these amounts are not included in our consolidated balance sheets, unless such amounts have been paid as of the balance sheet date. Factors such as the weighted average billings duration, the timing of contract start dates and timing of collections create variability in billings. Accordingly, while we believe billings is a useful leading indicator regarding the performance of our business, a decline in new or renewed subscriptions in a reporting period may not have an immediately apparent impact on billings for that reporting period due to factors that may offset the decline, such as an increase in billings duration, a decline in the dollar value of contracts with future start dates and an increase in collections in the current period related to contracts with future start dates. To facilitate greater year-over-year comparability in our billings information, we disclose the impact that foreign currency rate fluctuations and fluctuations in billings duration had on our billings. The impact of foreign currency rate fluctuations is calculated by translating the current period results for entities reporting in currencies other than U.S. Dollars into U.S. Dollars at the exchange rates in effect during the prior period presented, rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the current period. The impact of fluctuations in billings duration is calculated by applying the weighted average billings duration in effect during the prior period presented rather than the actual weighted average billings duration in effect during the current period. Weighted average billings duration refers to the weighted average billings duration for all our customer contracts commencing during the period, unless such amounts have been paid during the period. Although we believe these adjustments improve comparability of our billings information from period to period, a decline in new or renewed subscriptions in a reporting period may not have an immediately apparent impact on billings for that reporting period due to factors that may offset the decline, such as a decline in the dollar value of contracts with future start dates and an increase in collections in the current period related to contracts with future start dates. Foreign currency rate fluctuations had an unfavorable impact of $8.4 million and $74.3 million on billings for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Changes in weighted average billings duration had a favorable impact of $24.6 million and $1.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 respectively. 27 Free cash flow. We define free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, as GAAP net cash provided by operating activities reduced by purchases of property and equipment. We believe information regarding free cash flow provides useful information to investors because it is an indicator of the strength and performance of our business operations. However, our calculation of free cash flow may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies. In addition, free cash flow is impacted by the timing of collections and disbursements, including the timing of capital expenditures. A calculation of free cash flow is provided below: Year Ended December 31, 2016 2015 2014 (dollars in thousands)Free cash flow: Net cash provided by operating activities (1)$159,921 $317,754 $140,937Purchases of property and equipment(105,562) (87,481) (54,379)Free cash flow (2)$54,359 $230,273 $86,558(1) During the year ended December 31, 2016, we early adopted Accounting Standards Update 2016-09, ""Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting."" Refer to Note 2 Recent Accounting Pronouncements for further details. This adoption resulted in a $2.7 million increase in net cash provided by operating activities and a corresponding $2.7 million decrease in net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015, and a $2.0 million increase in net cash provided by operating activities and a corresponding $2.0 million decrease in net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2014, as compared to the amounts previously reported.(2) Free cash flow includes the effect of a $267.5 million payment for aggregate legal settlements for the year ended December 31, 2016. Refer to Note 16 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details.Average contract term. We calculate the average contract term for new customers, upsells and renewals based on the term of those contracts entered into during the period weighted by their ACV. The average new customer contract term was 32 months for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. The average upsell contract term was 26 months for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, and 25 months for the year ended December 31, 2014. The average renewal contract term was 28 months, 25 months, and 26 months for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Components of Results of Operations RevenuesSubscription revenues. Subscription revenues are primarily comprised of fees that give customers access to the ordered subscription service, related support and upgrades, if any, to the subscribed service during the subscription term. Pricing includes multiple instances, hosting and support services, data backup and disaster recovery services, as well as future upgrades, when and if available, offered during the subscription term. We typically invoice our customers for subscription fees in annual increments upon execution of the initial contract or subsequent renewal. Our contracts are generally non-cancelable during the subscription term, though a customer can terminate for breach if we materially fail to perform. Professional services and other revenues. Professional services revenues consist of fees associated with the implementation and configuration of our subscription service. Our arrangements for professional services are primarily on a time-and-materials basis. We generally invoice our professional services monthly in arrears based on actual hours and expenses incurred. Other revenues primarily include fees from customer training delivered on-site or publicly available classes, attendance and sponsorship fees for our annual Knowledge user conference and other customer forums. Typical payment terms require our customers to pay us within 30 days of invoice. We generate sales directly through our sales team and, to a lesser extent, through our channel partners. Revenues from our direct sales organization represented 88%, 89%, and 87% of our total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. We make sales to our channel partners at a discount and record those revenues at the discounted price when all revenue recognition criteria are met. From time to time, our channel partners and other third parties provide us referrals for which we pay a referral fee between 5% and 15% of the customer's ACV, depending on the level of activity the partner performs in the sales process. We include these fees in sales and marketing expense.28Allocation of Overhead Costs Overhead costs associated with office facilities, IT and certain depreciation related to infrastructure that is not dedicated for customer use or research and development use are allocated to cost of revenues and operating expenses based on headcount. Cost of Revenues Cost of subscription revenues. Cost of subscription revenues consists primarily of expenses related to hosting our services and providing support to our customers. These expenses are comprised of data center capacity costs, which includes facility costs associated with our data centers as well as interconnectivity between data centers, depreciation related to our cloud-based infrastructure hardware equipment dedicated for customer use, amortization of intangible assets and personnel related costs directly associated with our cloud-based infrastructure and customer support, including salaries, benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation and allocated overhead. Cost of professional services and other revenues. Cost of professional services and other revenues consists primarily of personnel related costs directly associated with our professional services and training departments, including salaries, benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation, the costs of contracted third-party partners, travel expenses and allocated overhead.Professional services associated with the implementation and configuration of our subscription services are performed directly by our services team, as well as by contracted third-party partners. Fees paid to third-party partners are primarily recognized as cost of revenues as the professional services are delivered. Cost of revenues associated with our professional services engagements contracted with third-party partners as a percentage of professional services and other revenues was 19%, 20% and 17% for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.Sales and Marketing Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel related expenses directly associated with our sales and marketing staff, including salaries, benefits, bonuses, commissions and stock-based compensation. Sales and marketing expenses also include third-party referral fees, expenses related to our annual Knowledge user conference, other marketing program expenses, which includes events, advertising and market data, and allocated overhead. Research and Development Research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel related expenses directly associated with our research and development staff, including salaries, benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation and allocated overhead. Research and development expenses also include data center capacity costs, amortization of intangible assets and depreciation of cloud-based infrastructure hardware equipment that are used solely for research and development purposes. General and Administrative General and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel related expenses for our executive, finance, legal, human resources, facility and administrative personnel, including salaries, benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation, external legal, accounting and other professional services fees, other corporate expenses, amortization of intangible assets and allocated overhead. Legal SettlementsLegal settlements consist of one-time aggregate charges related to the settlement agreements with Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (HPE) and BMC Software, Inc. (BMC). Refer to Note 16 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details of these matters.Provision for Income TaxesProvision for income taxes consists of federal, state and foreign income taxes. Due to cumulative losses, we maintain a valuation allowance against our U.S. deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2016 and 2015. We consider all available evidence, both positive and negative, including but not limited to earnings history, projected future outcomes, industry and market trends and the nature of each of the deferred tax assets in assessing the extent to which a valuation allowance should be applied against our U.S. deferred tax assets.29Results of Operations To enhance comparability, the following table sets forth our results of operations for the periods presented.

We expect subscription revenues to grow in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total revenues in the year ended December 31, 2017 as we continue to add new customers and upsell to existing customers. Our expectations for 2017 revenues, cost of revenues and operating expenses was based on foreign exchange rates as of December 31, 2016.Subscription revenues consist of the following: Year Ended December 31, % Change 2016 2015 (dollars in thousands) Service Management solutions$1,108,846 $783,603 42%IT Operations Management solutions112,793 64,675 74%Total subscription revenues$1,221,639 $848,278 44%Our Service Management solutions include ServiceNow Platform, IT Service Management, IT Business Management, Customer Service, Human Resources and Security Operations, which have similar features and functions and are generally priced on a per user basis. Our IT Operations Management solutions, which improve visibility, availability and agility of enterprise services, are generally priced on a per node basis. Professional services and other revenues increased $11.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the prior year, due to an increase in the services provided to our growing customer base. In addition, revenues from our annual Knowledge user conference increased to $12.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $10.9 million in the prior year due to increased sponsorship and paid registrations in the current year. We expect professional services and other revenues to grow at a slower rate compared to subscription revenues as we are increasingly focused on deploying our internal professional services organization as a strategic resource and relying on our partner ecosystem to contract directly with customers for service delivery.Our international operations have provided and will continue to provide a significant portion of our total revenues. Revenues outside North America represented 32% and 30% of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. As a result, the general strengthening of the U.S. Dollar relative to other major foreign currencies (primarily Euro) from the year ended December 31, 2015 to the year ended December 31, 2016 had an unfavorable impact on our revenues. For entities reporting in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar, if we had translated our results for the year ended December 31, 2016 at the exchange rates for the year ended December 31, 2015 rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the period, our subscription revenues would have increased by an additional $6.3 million. The impact from the foreign currency movements from the year ended December 31, 2015 to the year ended December 31, 2016 is not material to professional services and other revenues.32Cost of Revenues and Gross Profit Percentage Year Ended December 31, % Change 2016 2015 (dollars in thousands) Cost of revenues: Subscription$235,414 $183,400 28%Professional services and other163,268 146,013 12%Total cost of revenues$398,682 $329,413 21%Gross profit percentage: Subscription81% 78% Professional services and other3% 7% Total gross profit percentage71% 67% Gross profit:$991,831 $676,067 47%Headcount (at period end) Subscription729 579 26%Professional services and other496 486 2%Total headcount1,225 1,065 15% Cost of subscription revenues increased $52.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the prior year, primarily due to increased headcount resulting in an increase of $17.3 million in personnel related costs excluding stock-based compensation, an increase of $5.0 million in stock-based compensation, and an increase of $7.2 million in other overhead expenses. In addition, there was an increase of $10.3 million in depreciation expense primarily due to purchases of cloud-based infrastructure hardware equipment for our data centers, an increase of $5.3 million in data center capacity costs primarily due to the expansion of our data centers, and an increase of $1.5 million in amortization of intangible assets as a result of acquisitions in 2016. Our subscription gross profit percentage increased to 81% for the year ended December 31, 2016, from 78% for the year ended December 31, 2015, due to improved data center utilization and economies of scale. We expect our cost of subscription revenues to increase in absolute dollar terms as we provide subscription services to more customers and increase the number of users within our customer instances, but we expect such increase to be at a slower rate than the increase in our subscription revenue, leading to a slight increase in our subscription gross profit percentage for the year ended December 31, 2017 as we continue to leverage the investments we have made in our existing data center infrastructure. To the extent future acquisitions are consummated, our cost of subscription revenues may increase due to additional non-cash charges associated with the amortization of intangible assets acquired. Cost of professional services and other revenues increased $17.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the prior year, primarily due to increased headcount resulting in an increase of $8.0 million in personnel related costs excluding stock-based compensation, an increase of $3.2 million in stock-based compensation, and an increase of $3.4 million in overhead expenses.Our professional services and other gross profit percentage decreased to 3% during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to 7% in the prior year due to lower utilization rates as we invest in specialized resources to support our newer products and higher growth rate in our stock-based compensation of 14% compared to the growth rate in our professional services and other revenues of 7%, partially offset by the increase in revenues from our annual Knowledge user conference. Costs associated with Knowledge are included in sales and marketing expense. Knowledge contributed $12.8 million, or 8 percentage points to the professional services and other gross profit percentage for the year ended December 31, 2016. Knowledge contributed $10.9 million, or 7 percentage points to the professional services and other gross profit percentage for the year ended December 31, 2015. We expect cost of professional services and other revenues to increase in absolute dollars as our business grows, but we expect such increase to be at a slower rate than the increase in professional services and other revenues, leading to an increase in professional services and other gross profit percentage for the year ended December 31, 2017.33The general strengthening of the U.S. Dollar relative to other major foreign currencies from the year ended December 31, 2015 to the year ended December 31, 2016 had a favorable impact on our cost of revenues. For entities reporting in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar, if we had translated our results for the year ended December 31, 2016 at the exchange rates for the year ended December 31, 2015 rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the year ended December 31, 2016, our cost of subscription revenues would have increased by an additional $3.3 million and our cost of professional services and other revenues would have increased by an additional $1.6 million.

Commissions and referral fee expenses amounted to 7% and 8% of subscription revenues for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Outside services increased $3.7 million primarily due to an increase in contractors and professional fees to support our sales and marketing functionsIn addition, expenses related to our annual Knowledge user conference increased $3.0 million, from $21.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $24.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, due to a 31% increase in attendance year-over-year. All other marketing program expenses, which include events, advertising and market data, increased $18.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the prior year.The general strengthening of the U.S. Dollar relative to other major foreign currencies from the year ended December 31, 2015 to the year ended December 31, 2016 had a favorable impact on our sales and marketing expenses. For entities reporting in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar, if we had translated our results for the year ended December 31, 2016 at the exchange rates for the year ended December 31, 2015 rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the period, our sales and marketing expenses would have increased by an additional $6.3 million.We expect sales and marketing expenses to increase for the year ended December 31, 2017 in absolute dollar terms, but decrease slightly as a percentage of total revenues as we continue to expand our direct sales force, increase our marketing activities, grow our international operations, build brand awareness and sponsor additional marketing events.Research and Development Year Ended December 31 % Change 2016 2015 (dollars in thousands) Research and development$285,239 $217,389 31%Percentage of revenues21% 22% Headcount (at period end)1,054 756 39% Research and development expenses increased $67.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the prior year, primarily due to increased headcount resulting in an increase of $39.9 million in personnel related costs excluding stock-based compensation, an increase of $11.4 million in stock-based compensation, and an increase of $10.2 million in overhead expenses. Outside services increased $2.0 million primarily due to increase in professional fees to support our research and development functions. Research and development expenses also increased $2.5 million due to an increase in data center capacity costs and depreciation of cloud-based infrastructure hardware equipment that are used solely for research and development purposes. Amortization of intangible assets increased $1.2 million as a result of acquisitions in 2016.34The impact from the foreign currency movements from the year ended December 31, 2015 to the year ended December 31, 2016 is not material to research and development expenses. We expect research and development expenses to increase for the year ended December 31, 2017 in absolute dollar terms, but decrease slightly as a percentage of total revenues as we continue to improve the existing functionality of our services, develop new applications to fill market needs and continue to enhance our core platform.

The impact from the foreign currency movements from the year ended December 31, 2015 to the year ended December 31, 2016 is not material to general and administrative expenses.We expect general and administrative expenses to increase for the year ended December 31, 2017 in absolute dollar terms as we continue to hire people, but decrease slightly as a percentage of total revenues as we continue to grow.

Stock-based compensation is inherently difficult to forecast due to fluctuations in our stock price. Based upon our stock price as of December 31, 2016, we expect stock-based compensation to continue to increase for the year ended December 31, 2017 in absolute dollar terms, but decrease as a percentage of total revenues as we continue to grow. Interest Expense Year Ended December 31 % Change 2016 2015 (dollars in thousands) Interest expense$(33,278) $(31,097) 7%Percentage of revenues(2)% (3)% Interest expense increased $2.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the prior year, due to the increase in amortization expense of debt discount and issuance costs related to our convertible senior notes (Notes) issued in November 2013. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we expect to incur approximately $35.6 million in amortization expense of debt discount and issuance costs related to the Notes.

We had foreign exchange losses of $2.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to gains of $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as a result of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Interest income increased $3.3 million due to the higher yields during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the prior year.36Our expanding international operations will continue to increase our exposure to currency risks, though we cannot presently predict the impact of this exposure on our consolidated financial statements. While we have not engaged in the hedging of our foreign currency transactions to date, we are conducting an ongoing evaluation of the costs and benefits of initiating such a program and in the future may hedge selected significant transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. Provision for Income Taxes Year Ended December 31 % Change 2016 2015 (dollars in thousands) Loss before income taxes$(450,051) $(193,012) 133 %Provision for income taxes1,753 5,414 (68)%Effective tax rate— % (3)% Our effective tax rate was 0% for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to (3)% for the prior year. Our tax expense decreased $3.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the prior year, primarily due to a partial release of valuation allowance in connection with acquisitions. See Note 15 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for our reconciliation of income taxes at the statutory federal rate to the provision for income taxes.We continue to maintain a full valuation allowance on our U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets, and the significant components of the tax expense recorded are current cash taxes in various jurisdictions. The cash tax expenses are impacted by each jurisdiction’s individual tax rates, laws on timing of recognition of income and deductions, and availability of net operating losses and tax credits. Given the full valuation allowance, sensitivity of current cash taxes to local rules and our foreign structuring, we expect our effective tax rate could fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis and could be adversely affected to the extent earnings are lower than anticipated in countries that have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher statutory rates. We consider the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the United States.Net Loss Year Ended December 31 % Change 2016 2015 (dollars in thousands) Net loss$(451,804) $(198,426) 128%Percentage of revenues(32)% (20)% Net loss increased $253.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the prior year primarily due to legal settlements. Refer to Note 16 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details of these matters. We expect to continue to incur a GAAP loss for the year ended December 31, 2017, due to increased costs and expenses including non-cash charges associated with equity awards, amortization of purchased intangibles from business combinations and other expenses. 37Comparison of the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 Revenues Year Ended December 31, % Change 2015 2014 (dollars in thousands) Revenues: Subscription$848,278 $567,217 50%Professional services and other157,202 115,346 36%Total revenues$1,005,480 $682,563 47%Percentage of revenues: Subscription84% 83% Professional services and other16 17 Total100% 100% Subscription revenues increased $281.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the prior year, driven by upsells and an increase in customer count.

In addition, revenues from our annual Knowledge user conference increased to $10.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $8.2 million in the prior year due to increased sponsorship and paid registrations in the current year. Our international operations provided a significant portion of our total revenues. Revenues outside North America represented 30% and 32% of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. As a result, the general strengthening of the U.S. Dollar relative to other major foreign currencies (primarily Euro) from the year ended December 31, 2014 to the year ended December 31, 2015 had an unfavorable impact on our revenues.

Data center capacity costs increased $1.0 million primarily due to the expansion of our data centers. Amortization of intangible assets increased $4.8 million as a result of the acquisition of Neebula in July 2014. Our subscription gross profit percentage increased to 78% for the year ended December 31, 2015, from 75% for the year ended December 31, 2014, due to improved data center utilization and economies of scale. Cost of professional services and other revenues increased $39.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the prior year, primarily due to increased headcount resulting in an increase of $11.2 million in personnel related costs excluding stock-based compensation, an increase of $10.1 million in stock-based compensation, an increase of $5.3 million in overhead expenses, and an increase of $13.2 million in contracted third-party costs.Our professional services and other gross profit percentage decreased to 7% during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 8% in the prior year due to increased stock-based compensation. The decrease in gross profit percentage was partially offset by the increase in revenues from our annual Knowledge user conference.

We have prepared the quarterly data on a consistent basis with the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In the opinion of management, the financial information reflects all necessary adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair statement of this data.

We sign a significantly higher percentage of agreements with new customers, as well as renewal agreements with existing customers, in the quarter ended December 31. The increase in customer agreements for the quarter ended December 31 is primarily a result of the terms of our commission plans to incentivize our direct sales force to meet their annual quotas by December 31 and large enterprise account buying patterns typical in the software industry which are driven primarily by the expiration of annual authorized budgeted expenditures. Furthermore, we usually sign a significant portion of these agreements during the last month, and often the last two weeks, of each quarter. This seasonality in the timing of entering into customer contracts is sometimes not immediately apparent, in our billings, due to the fact that we exclude contracts with a future start date from our billings. Similarly, this seasonality is reflected to a much lesser extent, and sometimes is not immediately apparent in our revenues, due to the fact that we recognize subscription revenues over the term of the license agreement, which is generally 12 to 36 months. Although these seasonal factors are common in the technology industry, historical patterns should not be considered a reliable indicator of our future sales activity or performance. Our revenues have increased over the periods presented due to increased sales to new customers, as well as upsells to existing customers. We have historically seen an increase in professional services and other revenues in the quarter ended June 30, and a corresponding decrease in professional services and other revenues in the quarter ended September 30 due to the revenues earned from our annual Knowledge user conference that occurs in the quarter ended June 30. Our operating expenses have increased over the periods presented primarily due to increases in headcount and other related expenses to support our growth. We have historically seen an increase in marketing expenses in the quarter ended June 30, and a corresponding decrease in marketing expenses in the quarter ended September 30 due to the expenses incurred for our annual Knowledge user conference. Marketing expenses in the quarter ended December 31 are also historically higher due to customer forums we conduct in that quarter. We anticipate operating expenses will continue to increase in future periods as we continue to focus on investing in the long-term growth of our business.Our free cash flow is impacted by the timing of collections and disbursements, including the timing of capital expenditures. We have historically seen higher collections in the quarter ended March 31 due to seasonality in timing of entering into customer contracts as described above.Liquidity and Capital Resources Year Ended December 31, 2016 2015 2014 (dollars in thousands)Net cash provided by operating activities$159,921$317,754 $140,937Net cash used in investing activities(108,448)(231,743) (316,928)Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities(55,752)80,330 68,735Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents, net of impact of exchange rates on cash(11,067)159,850 (113,848) Our principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents, investments, and cash generated from operations. As of December 31, 2016, we had $899.4 million in cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, of which $184.5 million represented cash owned by foreign subsidiaries. In addition, we had $262.7 million in long-term investments that provide additional capital resources.We anticipate our current cash and cash equivalents balance and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs including the expansion of data centers, lease obligations, expenditures related to the growth of our headcount and the acquisition of fixed assets, intangibles, and investments in office facilities to accommodate our growth for at least the next 12 months. Whether these resources are adequate to meet our liquidity needs beyond that period will depend on our growth, operating results, cash utilized for acquisitions and/or debt retirements if any are consummated, and the capital expenditures required to meet possible increased demand for our services. If we require additional capital resources to grow our business at any time in the future, we may seek to finance our operations from the current funds available or seek additional equity or debt financing. 44Operating ActivitiesCash provided by operating activities mainly consists of our net loss adjusted for certain non-cash items, including depreciation and amortization, amortization of premiums on investments, amortization of deferred commissions, amortization of issuance cost and debt discount, stock-based compensation and changes in operating assets and liabilities during the year.Net cash provided by operating activities was $159.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $317.8 million for the prior year. The decrease in operating cash flow was primarily due to $267.5 million cash paid for aggregate legal settlements during the year ended December 31, 2016 (refer to Note 16 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details). The remaining change was due to an increase in non-cash adjustments to reconcile net loss to net cash provided by operations and the favorable impact on operating cash flow from changes in operating assets and liabilities. Net cash provided by operating activities was $317.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $140.9 million for the prior year. The increase in operating cash flow was primarily due to an increased net loss offset by a substantial increase in non-cash adjustments to reconcile net loss to net cash provided by operations and the favorable impact on operating cash flow from changes in operating assets and liabilities. Net cash flow from the aggregate of changes in accounts receivable, deferred commissions and deferred revenue increased due to increased sales for the year ended December 31, 2015. Net cash flows from the aggregate of changes in accrued liabilities, accounts payable and prepaid expenses increased due to the growth of our business and increased headcount of 30% for the year ended December 31, 2015, as well as timing of our cash payments. Investing ActivitiesNet cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $108.4 million compared to $231.7 million for the prior year. The decrease in cash used in investing activities was mainly due to the $181.6 million decrease in the net purchases of investments and $10.0 million decrease in the purchases of strategic investments, partially offset by $33.2 million increase in business combinations, net of cash acquired, $17.0 million increase in purchase of other intangibles and $18.1 million increase in capital expenditures related to the purchase of cloud-based infrastructure hardware equipment to support the expansion of our data centers as well as investments in leasehold improvements, furniture and equipment to support our headcount growth.Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $231.7 million compared to $316.9 million for the prior year. The decrease in cash used in investing activities was mainly due to the $32.0 million decrease in the net purchases of investments and the $98.7 million decrease in cash used for acquisitions, offset by the $33.1 million increase in capital expenditures related to the purchase of cloud-based infrastructure hardware equipment to support the expansion of our data centers as well as investments in leasehold improvements, furniture and equipment to support our headcount growth and the $10.5 million increase in the purchases of strategic investments. Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $55.8 million compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $80.3 million for the prior year. The change was primarily due to the $107.1 million increase in taxes paid related to net share settlement of equity awards as a result of a policy change to net settle shares for all U.S. employees starting in 2016 and $27.0 million decrease in proceeds from employee stock plans due to a reduction in the number of stock options issued in the last four years. Based upon our stock price as of December 31, 2016, we expect an increase in taxes paid related to net share settlement of equity awards for the year ended December 31, 2017. Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $80.3 million compared to $68.7 million for the prior year. The increase in cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to the $24.0 million increase in proceeds from employee stock plans, offset by the $12.1 million increase in taxes paid related to net share settlement of equity awards. 45Contractual Obligations and CommitmentsThe following table represents our future non-cancelable contractual obligations as of December 31, 2016, aggregated by type: Payments Due by Period Total LessThan1 Year 1 – 3Years 3 – 5Years MoreThan5 Years (in thousands)Operating leases, net of sublease income (1)$298,471 $33,855 $71,929 $70,044 $122,643Purchase obligations (2)43,940 17,933 19,930 6,077 —Convertible Senior Notes (3)575,000 — 575,000 — —Other4,050 517 1,034 1,034 1,465Total contractual obligations$921,461 $52,305 $667,893 $77,155 $124,108(1)Consists of future non-cancelable minimum rental payments under operating leases for some of our offices and data centers, net of future non-cancelable sublease income.(2)Consists of future minimum payments under non-cancelable purchase commitments primarily related to data center and IT operations. Not included in the table above are certain purchase commitments related to our future Knowledge user conferences. If we were to cancel these agreements as of December 31, 2016, we would have been obligated to pay cancellation penalties of approximately $18.1 million in aggregate.(3)Refer to Note 9 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Subsequent to the year ended December 31, 2016, we entered into certain lease agreements for additional office space. Total future minimum lease payments under these operating leases of approximately $52.1 million in aggregate are not included in the table above. $29.6 million of the $52.1 million relates to an expansion and lease term extension of our existing San Diego office facility. In addition to the obligations in the table above, approximately $4.0 million of unrecognized tax benefits have been recorded as liabilities as of December 31, 2016. It is uncertain as to if or when such amounts may be settled. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements During all periods presented, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. As such, we are not exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in those types of relationships.Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and EstimatesOur management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. These items are monitored and analyzed by us for changes in facts and circumstances, and material changes in these estimates could occur in the future. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Changes in estimates are reflected in reported results for the period in which they become known. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions and such differences could be material.While our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe that the following accounting policies are critical to the process of making significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our audited consolidated financial statements. 46Revenue RecognitionWe derive our revenues from two sources: (i) subscriptions and (ii) professional services and other. Subscription revenues are primarily comprised of subscription fees that give customers access to the ordered subscription service, related support and updates, if any, to the subscribed service during the subscription term.Our contracts typically do not give the customer the right to take possession of the software supporting the services. Professional services and other revenues consist of fees associated with the implementation and configuration of our services. Professional services and other revenues also include customer training and attendance and sponsorship fees for Knowledge, our annual user conference and other customer forums.We commence revenue recognition when all of the following conditions are met:There is persuasive evidence of an arrangement;The service has been provided to the customer;The collection of related fees is reasonably assured; andThe amount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable.We use a signed contract together with a signed order form as evidence of an arrangement for a new customer. In subsequent transactions with an existing customer, including an upsell or a renewal, we consider the existing signed contract and either the new signed order form or new purchase order as evidence of an arrangement.We recognize subscription revenues ratably over the contract term beginning on the commencement date of each contract, the date we make our services available to our customers. Once our services are available to customers, we record amounts due in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue. To the extent we bill customers in advance of the contract commencement date, the accounts receivable and corresponding deferred revenue amounts are netted to zero on our consolidated balance sheets, unless such amounts have been paid as of the balance sheet date.Our professional services arrangements are primarily on a time-and-materials basis and revenues on these arrangements are recognized as the services are delivered. Professional services revenues associated with fixed fee arrangements are recognized using a proportional performance model. In instances where certain milestones are required to be met before revenues are recognized, we defer professional services revenues and the associated costs until milestone criteria have been met.We assess collectibility based on a number of factors such as past collection history with the customer and creditworthiness of the customer. If we determine collectibility is not reasonably assured, we defer revenue recognition until collectibility becomes reasonably assured. We assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment. Our arrangements are generally non-cancelable and do not contain refund-type provisions.We have multiple element arrangements comprised of subscription fees and professional services. We account for subscription and professional services revenues as separate units of accounting. To qualify as a separate unit of accounting, the delivered item must have value to the customer on a standalone basis. We have concluded that our subscription service has standalone value as it is routinely sold separately by us. In addition, the applications offered through this subscription service are fully functional without any additional development, modification or customization. We provide customers access to our subscription service at the beginning of the contract term. In determining whether professional services have standalone value, we considered the following factors for each professional services agreement: availability of the services from other vendors, the nature of the professional services, the timing of when the professional services contract was signed in comparison to the subscription service start date and the contractual dependence of the subscription service on the customer’s satisfaction with the professional services work. Our professional services, including implementation and configuration services, are not so unique and complex that other vendors cannot provide them. In some instances, customers independently contract with third-party vendors to do the implementation and we regularly outsource implementation services to contracted third-party vendors. As a result, we concluded professional services, including implementation and configuration services, have standalone value.47The total arrangement consideration for a multiple element arrangement is allocated to the identifiable separate units of accounting based on a relative selling price hierarchy. We determined the relative selling price for a deliverable based on its vendor-specific objective evidence (VSOE) of selling price or third-party evidence (TPE) of selling price if VSOE does not exist. If neither VSOE nor TPE of selling price exists for a deliverable, the selling price is determined using the best estimate of selling price (BESP). We determine the BESP for each deliverable primarily by considering the historical selling price of these deliverables in similar transactions as well as other factors, including, but not limited to, market competition, review of stand-alone sales and current pricing practices. In determining the appropriate pricing structure, we consider the available information regarding the competitive pricing of similar products and marketing analysis.In limited circumstances, we grant certain customers the right to deploy our subscription service on the customers’ own servers. These arrangements are subject to software revenue recognition guidance since the customer deploys our software. As we never sell the non-software elements separately from the software elements, we have determined that we do not have sufficient VSOE of fair value for all undelivered non-software elements. Consequently, we defer all revenue and related costs under the arrangement until the last element in the transaction has been delivered or starts to be delivered. Once the delivery of the last element has commenced, we recognize the entire fee and related costs from the arrangement ratably over the remaining period of the arrangement.Deferred revenue consists primarily of payments received in advance of revenue recognition for our subscriptions and professional services and other revenues and is recognized as the revenue recognition criteria are met.Deferred Commissions Deferred commissions are the incremental selling costs that are directly associated with our customer contracts and consist of sales commissions paid to our direct sales force and referral fees paid to independent third-parties. The majority of commissions and referral fees are deferred and amortized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the related customer contracts. We include amortization of deferred commissions in sales and marketing expense in the consolidated statements of comprehensive loss. We believe this is the preferable method of accounting as the commission charges are so closely related to the revenue from the customer contracts that they should be recorded as an asset and charged to expense over the same period that the revenue is recognized. The commission payments are generally paid in full the month after the customer’s initial service under the contract commences. Goodwill, Intangible Assets and Other Long Lived AssetsGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price in a business combination over the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired. The allocation of the purchase price requires us to make significant estimates in determining the fair value of acquired assets and assumed liabilities, especially with respect to intangible assets. These estimates are based upon a number of factors, including historical experience, market conditions and information obtained from the management of the acquired company. Critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets included, but are not limited to, cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future, discount rates, the time and expense that would be necessary to recreate the assets and the profit margin a market participant would receive. These estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates.We evaluate and test the recoverability of goodwill for impairment at least annually during our fourth quarter or more frequently if circumstances indicate that goodwill may not be recoverable. We perform the impairment testing by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of its reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we perform a two-step impairment test. The first step requires the identification of the reporting units and comparison of the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an indication of goodwill impairment exists for the reporting unit and the second step of the impairment test is performed to compute the amount of the impairment. Under the second step, an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit's goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill. We have determined that we have a single reporting unit. We have not recognized any impairment charges related to goodwill during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 because the aggregate fair value of our company has consistently and materially exceeded the carrying value of our single reporting unit.48We periodically review the carrying amounts of long-lived assets, such as property and equipment, and purchased intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. We measure the recoverability of these assets by comparing the carrying amount of each asset to the future undiscounted cash flows we expect the asset to generate. If we consider any of these assets to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized equals the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. In addition, we periodically evaluate the estimated remaining useful lives of long-lived assets to determine whether events or changes in circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of depreciation or amortization. Our intangible assets are amortized over their useful lives ranging from 18 months to ten years.Screening for and assessing whether impairment indicators exist or if events or changes in circumstances have occurred, including market conditions, operating fundamentals, competition and general economic conditions, requires significant judgment. Additionally, changes in the technology industry occur frequently and quickly. Therefore, there can be no assurance that a charge to operating expenses will not occur as a result of future goodwill, intangible assets and other long-lived assets impairment tests.Legal Contingencies From time to time, we are a party to litigation and other legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business. We accrue for loss contingencies when we can reasonably estimate the amount of loss or range of loss and when, based on the advice of counsel, it is probable that we will incur the loss. Because of uncertainties related to these matters, we base our estimate on the information available at the time of our assessment. As additional information becomes available, we reassess our potential liability and may revise our estimate. Any revisions in the estimate of potential liabilities could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Stock-based Compensation We recognize compensation expense related to stock options and restricted stock units (RSUs) on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting term of four years. For RSUs granted with a performance condition, the expenses are recognized on a graded vesting basis over the vesting period, after assessing the probability of achieving requisite performance criteria. This has the impact of greater stock-based compensation expense during the initial years of the vesting period as stock-based compensation cost is recognized over the requisite service period for each separately vesting tranche of the award as though the award were, in substance, multiple awards. We recognize compensation expense related to shares issued pursuant to the employee stock purchase plan (ESPP) on a straight-line basis over the offering period. We estimate the fair value of options using the Black-Scholes options pricing model and fair value of RSU awards using the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant. We recognize compensation expense net of estimated forfeiture activity, which is based on historical forfeiture rates. We evaluate the forfeiture rates at least annually or when events or circumstances indicate a change may be needed. This may cause a fluctuation in our stock-based compensation in the period of change.Income Taxes We use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes, in which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. We measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be reversed. We recognize the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates as income and expense in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is established if it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. In determining the need for a valuation allowance, we consider future growth, forecasted earnings, future taxable income, the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate, historical earnings, taxable income in prior years, if carryback is permitted under the law, carryforward periods and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies.Our tax positions are subject to income tax audits by multiple tax jurisdictions throughout the world. We recognize the tax benefit of an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not the position is sustainable upon examination by the taxing authority, based on the technical merits. We measure the tax benefit recognized as the largest amount of benefit which is more likely than not to be realized upon settlement with the taxing authority. We recognize interest accrued and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in our tax provision. Significant judgment is required to evaluate uncertain tax positions. Our evaluations are based upon a number of factors, including changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law or guidance, correspondence with tax authorities during the course of audits and effective settlement of audit issues. Changes in the recognition or measurement of uncertain tax positions could result in material increases or decreases in our income tax expense in the period in which we make the change, which could have a material impact on our effective tax rate and operating results.49We calculate the current and deferred income tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed in subsequent years and record adjustments based on filed income tax returns when identified. The amount of income taxes paid is subject to examination by U.S. federal, state and foreign tax authorities. The estimate of the potential outcome of any uncertain tax issue is subject to management’s assessment of relevant risks, facts and circumstances existing at that time. To the extent the assessment of such tax position changes, we record the change in estimate in the period in which we make the determination. New Accounting Pronouncements Adopted in 2016In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, ""Compensation—Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting,"" which simplifies several aspects of the accounting for employee share-based payment transactions, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, and statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as classification in the statement of cash flows. This standard is effective for our interim and annual reporting periods beginning January 1, 2017, and early adoption is permitted. We elected to early adopt this standard during the three months ended June 30, 2016. The impact of the early adoption was as follows:•The standard eliminates additional paid in capital (APIC) pools and requires excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies to be recorded in the income statement as a discrete item when the awards vest or are settled. The adoption of this guidance on a prospective basis resulted in the recognition of excess tax benefits in our provision for income taxes of $2.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.•The standard requires excess tax benefits be recognized regardless of whether the benefit reduces taxes payable. The adoption of this guidance on a modified retrospective basis resulted in the recognition of a cumulative-effect adjustment of $11.4 million that reduced our accumulated deficit and increased our foreign long-term deferred income tax as of January 1, 2016. The previously unrecognized domestic excess tax effects were recorded as a deferred tax asset net of a valuation allowance.•We have elected to continue to estimate forfeitures expected to occur to determine the amount of stock-based compensation cost to be recognized in each period. As such, the guidance relating to forfeitures did not have an impact on our accumulated deficit as of January 1, 2016.•We elected to apply the statement of cash flows guidance that cash flows related to excess tax benefits be presented as an operating activity retrospectively, which resulted in a $2.7 million increase to net cash provided by operating activities and a corresponding decrease to net cash provided by financing activities in the accompanying consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2015, and a $2.0 million increase to net cash provided by operating activities and a corresponding decrease to net cash provided by financing activities in the accompanying consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2014, as compared to the amounts previously reported.•The statement of cash flows guidance that cash flows related to employee taxes paid for withheld shares be presented as a financing activity had no impact on our consolidated financial statements as we have historically presented such cash flows as a financing activity.In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-16, “Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments (Topic 805),” which eliminates the requirement to restate prior period financial statements for measurement period adjustments in business combinations. This new standard requires that the cumulative impact of a measurement period adjustment (including the impact on prior periods) be recognized in the reporting period in which the adjustment is identified. We adopted this standard during the three months ended March 31, 2016 on a prospective basis and the adoption had no material impact on our consolidated financial statements.In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-05, ""Intangibles—Goodwill and Other—Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer’s Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement."" ASU 2015-05 provides guidance to customers about whether a cloud computing arrangement includes software. If a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license, the customer should account for the software license element of the arrangement consistent with the acquisition of other software licenses. If a cloud computing arrangement does not include a software license, the customer should account for the arrangement as a service contract. We adopted this standard during the three months ended March 31, 2016 on a prospective basis and the adoption had no material impact on our consolidated financial statements.50Pending Accounting PronouncementsIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, ""Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment,"" which eliminates Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. The standard requires an entity to perform its annual, or interim, goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. An entity should recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value. In addition, this new standard eliminates the requirements for any reporting unit with a zero or negative carrying amount to perform a qualitative assessment. This standard is effective for our interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019, and early adoption is permitted. We do not anticipate this standard will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-01, “Business Combinations (Topic 805): Clarifying the Definition of a Business,” which clarifies the definition of a business with the objective of adding guidance to assist entities with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions (or disposals) of assets or businesses. The definition of a business affects many areas of accounting including acquisitions, disposals, goodwill and consolidation. This standard is effective for our interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of this standard on our consolidated financial statements.In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18, ""Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash (a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force,"" which requires that amounts generally described as restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows. This standard is effective for our interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and early adoption is permitted. We do not anticipate this standard will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-16, ""Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory,"" which includes a revision of the accounting for the income tax consequences of intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory to reduce the complexity in accounting standards. This standard is effective for our interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of this standard on our consolidated financial statements.In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, ""Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments,"" which provides guidance on eight specific cash flow issues. Among these issues, this standard requires, at the settlement of zero-coupon debt instruments or other debt instruments with coupon interest rates that are insignificant in relation to the effective interest rate of the borrowings, the portion of the cash payment attributable to the accreted interest related to the debt discount to be classified as cash flows for operating activities, and the portion of the cash payments attributable to the principal to be classified as cash outflows for financing activities. This standard is effective for our interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of this standard on our consolidated financial statements.In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, ""Financial Instruments—Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments,"" which requires a financial asset measured at amortized cost basis to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected. Credit losses relating to available-for-sale debt securities should be recorded through an allowance for credit losses. This standard is effective for our interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019. We are currently evaluating the impact of this standard on our consolidated financial statements.In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, ""Leases (Topic 842),"" which requires lessees to generally recognize on the balance sheet operating and financing lease liabilities and corresponding right-of-use assets, and to recognize on the income statement the expenses in a manner similar to current practice. This new standard is effective for our interim and annual periods beginning January 1, 2019 and early adoption is permitted. While we are currently evaluating the impact of this standard on our consolidated financial statements, we anticipate this standard will have a material impact on our consolidated balance sheets given that we had operating lease commitments of approximately $300 million as of December 31, 2016. However, we do not anticipate this standard will have a material impact on our consolidated statements of comprehensive loss since the expense recognition under this new standard will be similar to current practice.In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, ""Financial Instruments-Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities,"" which addresses certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments. This new standard is effective for our interim and annual periods beginning January 1, 2018. We are currently evaluating the impact of this standard on our consolidated financial statements.51In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, ""Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)."" Under the new standard, revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services and is recognized in an amount that reflects the consideration which the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. In addition, the standard requires disclosure of the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. The FASB has recently issued several amendments to the standard, including clarification on accounting for licenses of intellectual property and identifying performance obligations. These new standards are effective for our interim and annual periods beginning January 1, 2018 and early adoption beginning January 1, 2017 is permitted. We are planning to adopt these new standards beginning January 1, 2018. The guidance permits two methods of adoption: retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented (full retrospective method) or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the guidance recognized at the date of initial application (modified retrospective method). We currently anticipate adopting the standard using the full retrospective method to restate each prior reporting period presented. We expect the new standard to impact the timing of revenue and expense recognition for our contracts related to on-premises offerings, in which we grant customers the right to deploy our subscription service on the customer’s own servers. Under this new standard, the requirement to have vendor specific objective evidence (VSOE) for undelivered elements is eliminated. As such, we may be required to recognize as revenue a portion of the sales price upon delivery of the software compared to the current practice of recognizing the entire sales price ratably over an estimated subscription period due to the lack of VSOE. Currently, revenues from our on-premises offerings, under the ratable recognition model, represent less than 10% of our total revenues. Costs associated with our on-premises offerings, including commissions paid on the software, will be expensed immediately under the new standard. In addition, we expect the new standard to impact our deferred commissions asset and the related amortization expense as the types of incremental costs requiring capitalization as well as the expense amortization period could change from our current practice. We currently expect the deferred commissions asset to increase and the related amortization expense in each reporting period to decrease under the new standard due to an increase in the average term over which such commissions are amortized. We are continuing to evaluate the impact of the adoption of this standard on our consolidated financial statements and our preliminary assessments are subject to change.ITEM 7A.QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKForeign Currency Exchange RiskWe have foreign currency risks related to our revenue and operating expenses denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar, primarily the Euro and British Pound Sterling. We are a net receiver of Euro and therefore are adversely affected by a strengthening of the U.S. Dollar relative to the Euro. Revenues denominated in U.S. Dollar as a percentage of total revenue was 73%, 74% and 72% during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Changes in exchange rates have recently and may continue to negatively affect our total revenues. We have experienced and expect to continue to experience fluctuations in our net loss as a result of transaction gains or losses related to remeasuring monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entities in which they are recorded. We recognized a net foreign currency loss of $2.2 million and a foreign currency gain $0.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. While we have not engaged in the hedging of our foreign currency transactions to date, we may do so in the future.A hypothetical 10% decrease in the U.S. Dollar against other currencies would result in a decrease in operating loss of approximately $9.4 million and $2.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The change in hypothetical reduction in operating loss for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 is due to an increase in the mix of foreign currency revenue relative to foreign currency expenses. This analysis disregards the possibilities that rates can move in opposite directions and that losses from one geographic area may be offset by gains from another geographic area. 52Interest Rate Sensitivity We had an aggregate of $1.2 billion in cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and long-term investments at December 31, 2016. This amount was invested primarily in money market funds, time deposits, corporate notes and bonds, government securities and other debt securities with a minimum rating of BBB by Standard & Poor's. Baa2 by Moody's or BBB by Fitch. The primary objectives of our investment activities are the preservation of capital and support of our liquidity requirements. Our investments are exposed to market risk due to fluctuations in interest rates, which may affect our interest income and the fair market value of our investments. As of December 31, 2016, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would have resulted in an approximate $5.7 million decline of the fair value of our available-for-sale securities. This estimate is based on a sensitivity model that measures market value changes when changes in interest rates occur.As of December 31, 2015, we had an aggregate of $1.2 billion in cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and long-term investments, and a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would have resulted in an approximate $7.4 million decline of the fair value of our available-for-sale securities. Market RiskIn November 2013, we issued Notes with an aggregate principal amount of $575.0 million. We carry this instrument at face value less unamortized discount on our consolidated balance sheet. Because this instrument does not bear interest, we have no financial statement risk associated with changes in interest rates. However, the fair value of fixed rate instruments fluctuates when interest rates change, and in the case of convertible notes, when the market price of our stock fluctuates.We hold cash balances with multiple financial institutions in various countries and these balances routinely exceed deposit insurance limits.As of December 31, 2016, we had $11.0 million invested in privately-held companies that are in the development stage. The fair value of these investments may fluctuate depending on the financial condition and near-term prospects of these companies, and we may be required to record an impairment charge if the carrying value of these investments exceed their fair value.53",2023-12-30 18:26:46.888026
1373715,NOW,"ServiceNow, Inc.",2018,"ITEM 7.MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes appearing under “Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in Item 8 of this filing. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this filing, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. You should carefully read the “Risk Factors” section of this filing for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results and the timing of certain events to differ materially from future results expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.Our billings and free cash flow measures included in the sections entitled “—Key Business Metrics—Billings,” and “—Key Business Metrics—Free Cash Flow” are not in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). These non-GAAP financial measures are not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. These measures may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, limiting their usefulness for comparison purposes. We encourage investors to carefully consider our results under GAAP, as well as our supplemental non-GAAP results, to more fully understand our business.25Table of ContentsOverview ServiceNow is a leading provider of enterprise cloud computing solutions that define, structure, manage and automate services for global enterprises. We help our customers improve service quality and reduce costs while scaling and automating their businesses.We generally offer our services on an annual subscription fee basis, which includes access to the ordered subscription service and related support, including updates to the subscription service during the subscription term. We provide a scaled pricing model based on the duration of the subscription term, and we frequently extend discounts to our customers based on the number of users. We generate sales through our direct sales team and, to a lesser extent, indirectly through resale partners and third-party referrals. We also generate revenues from professional services and for training of customer and partner personnel. We generally bill our customers annually in advance for subscription services and monthly in arrears for our professional services as the work is performed.A majority of our revenues come from large global enterprise customers. We continue to invest in the development of our services, infrastructure and sales and marketing to drive long-term growth. We increased our overall employee headcount to 6,222 as of December 31, 2017 from 4,801 as of December 31, 2016.New Revenue Recognition Standard under Topic 606In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued a new standard related to revenue recognition from contracts with customers (Topic 606), which is effective beginning January 1, 2018. Topic 606 supersedes the prior revenue recognition standard (Topic 605) for periods beginning January 1, 2018. The most significant impacts of the standard relate to the timing of revenue recognition related to our on-premises offerings, in which we grant customers the right to deploy our software on the customer’s own servers without significant penalty, the accounting for incremental costs to obtain a contract and the classification of proceeds from Knowledge and other user forums as a reduction in sales and marketing expenses instead of professional services and other revenues.Our results of operations below are presented under Topic 605. Our expectations for 2018 revenues, cost of revenues and operating expenses, including the comparison period amounts used to derive the expected trends, are based on Topic 606. In addition, our expectations for 2018 revenues, cost of revenues and operating expenses are based on foreign exchange rates as of December 31, 2017. Refer to Note 2 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for details regarding Topic 606, including adjusted amounts for historical periods.Key Business Metrics Number of customers with ACV greater than $1 million. We count the total number of customers with annualized contract value (ACV) greater than $1 million as of the end of the period. We had 500, 350 and 231 customers with ACV greater than $1 million as of December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. For purposes of customer count, a customer is defined as an entity with a unique Dunn & Bradstreet Global Ultimate (GULT), Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number and an active subscription contract as of the measurement date. The DUNS number is a global standard for business identification and tracking. We make exceptions for holding companies, government entities and other organizations for which the GULT, in our judgment, does not accurately represent the ServiceNow customer. For example, while all U.S. government agencies roll up to “Government of the United States” under the GULT, we count each government agency that we contract with as a separate customer. Our customer count is subject to adjustments for acquisitions, spin-offs and other market activity. Previously disclosed number of customers with ACV greater than $1 million as well as our average contract term calculations are restated to allow for comparability. ACV is calculated based on the foreign exchange rate in effect at the time the contract was signed. Foreign exchange rate fluctuations could cause some variability in the number of customers with ACV greater than $1 million. 26Table of ContentsG2K customer count. The Global 2000 (G2K) customer count is defined as the total number of G2K companies in our customer base as of the end of the period. The Forbes Global 2000 is an annual ranking of the top 2,000 public companies in the world by Forbes magazine. The ranking is based on a mix of four metrics: sales, profit, assets, and market value. The Forbes Global 2000 is updated annually in the second quarter of the calendar year. Current and prior period G2K customer counts are based on the most recent list for comparability purposes. We adjust the G2K count for acquisitions, spin-offs and other market activity. For example, we add a G2K customer when a G2K company that is not our customer acquires a company in our existing customer base that is not a G2K company. When we enter into a contract with a G2K parent company, or any of its related subsidiaries, or any combination of entities within a G2K company, we count only one G2K customer. We do not count further penetration into entities within a given G2K as a new customer in the G2K customer count. Our G2K customer count also excludes customers that have only purchased our Express product offering, which is our entry-level IT service management solution. Our G2K customer count was 840, 737 and 637 as of December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Average ACV per G2K customer. We calculate average ACV for our G2K customers by taking aggregate ACV from G2K customers as of the end of the period divided by the total number of G2K customers as of the end of the period. ACV is calculated based on the foreign exchange rate in effect at the time the contract was entered into, and as a result, foreign currency rate fluctuations could cause variability in the average ACV per G2K customer. Prior G2K customer counts used in calculating ACV per G2K are adjusted for the most recent Forbes Global 2000 list for comparability purposes. Our average ACV per G2K customer was approximately $1.3 million, $1.1 million and $0.9 million as of December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.Renewal rate. We calculate our renewal rate by subtracting our attrition rate from 100%. Our attrition rate for a period is equal to the ACV from customers lost during the period, divided by the total ACV from all customers that renewed during the period, excluding changes in price or users, and total ACV from all customers lost during the period. Accordingly, our renewal rate is calculated based on ACV and is not based on the number of customers that have renewed. A lost customer is a customer that did not renew an expiring contract and that, in our judgment, will not be renewed. Typically, a customer that reduces its subscription upon renewal is not considered a lost customer. However, in instances where the subscription decrease represents the majority of the customer's ACV, we may deem the renewal as a lost customer. For our renewal rate calculation, we define a customer as an entity with a separate production instance of our service and an active subscription contract as of the measurement date, instead of an entity with a unique GULT or DUNS number. Our renewal rate was 97% for the year ended December 31, 2017 and 98% for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. As our renewal rate is impacted by the timing of renewals, which could occur in advance of, or subsequent to the original contract end date, period-to-period comparison of renewal rates may not be meaningful.Billings. We define billings, a non-GAAP financial measure, as revenues recognized plus the change in total deferred revenue as presented on the consolidated statements of cash flows. The change in total deferred revenue as presented on the consolidated statements of cash flows represents the change in deferred revenues in local currencies translated into U.S. dollars using an average foreign currency exchange rate, and aligns actual billings with the exchange rates in effect at the time of the billings. We believe billings is a useful leading indicator regarding the performance of our business. A calculation of billings is provided below: Year Ended December 31, 2017 2016 2015 (dollars in thousands)Billings: Total revenues$1,933,026 $1,390,513 $1,005,480Change in deferred revenue from the consolidated statements of cash flows381,562 300,167 195,900Total billings$2,314,588 $1,690,680 $1,201,380Year-over-year percentage change in total billings37% 41% 41%Billings consists of amounts invoiced for subscription contracts with existing customers, renewals, upsells and new customers, and contracts for professional services, training, and our Knowledge and other user forum events. Factors that may cause our billings results to vary from period to period include the following:•Billings duration. While we typically bill customers annually for our subscription services, customers sometimes request, and we accommodate, billings with durations less than or greater than the typical 12-month term. 27Table of Contents•Contract start date. From time to time, we enter into contracts with a contract start date in the future, and we exclude these amounts from billings as these amounts are not included in our consolidated balance sheets, unless such amounts have been paid as of the balance sheet date. •Foreign currency exchange rates. While a majority of our billings have historically been in U.S. Dollars, an increasing percentage of our billings in recent periods has been in foreign currencies, particularly the Euro and British Pound Sterling. •Timing of contract renewals. While customers typically renew their contracts at the end of the contract term, from time to time customers may do so either before or after the scheduled expiration date. For example, in cases where we are successful in upselling additional products or services, a customer may decide to renew its existing contract early to ensure that all its contracts expire on the same date. In other cases, prolonged negotiations or other factors may result in a contract not being renewed until after it has expired. Accordingly, while we believe billings is a useful leading indicator regarding the performance of our business, an increase or decrease in new or renewed subscriptions in a reporting period may not have an immediate impact on billings for that reporting period. To facilitate greater year-over-year comparability in our billings results, we disclose the impact that foreign currency rate fluctuations and fluctuations in billings duration had on our billings. The impact of foreign currency rate fluctuations is calculated by translating the current period results for entities reporting in currencies other than U.S. Dollars into U.S. Dollars at the average exchange rates in effect during the prior period presented, rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the current period. The impact of fluctuations in billings duration is calculated by replacing the portion of multi-year billings in excess of 12 months during the current period with the portion of multi-year billings in excess of 12 months during the prior period presented. Notwithstanding the adjustments described above, the comparability of billings results from period to period remains subject to the impact of variations in the dollar value of contracts with future start dates and the timing of contract renewals, for which no adjustments have been presented.Foreign currency rate fluctuations had a favorable impact of $8.3 million and an unfavorable impact of $8.4 million on billings for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Changes in billings duration had a favorable impact of $1.6 million and $16.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued a new standard related to revenue recognition from contracts with customers (Topic 606), which is effective beginning on January 1, 2018. Under Topic 606, due to the change in timing of revenue recognition under certain of our contracts, our definition of billings will be revenues recognized plus the change in total deferred revenue, unbilled receivables, and customer deposits as presented on or derived from our consolidated statements of cash flows. Refer to Note 2 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for details regarding Topic 606.Free cash flow. We define free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, as GAAP net cash provided by operating activities reduced by purchases of property and equipment. Purchases of property and equipment are otherwise included in cash used in investing activities under GAAP. We believe information regarding free cash flow provides useful information to investors because it is an indicator of the strength and performance of our business operations. However, our calculation of free cash flow may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies. A calculation of free cash flow is provided below: Year Ended December 31, 2017 2016 2015 (dollars in thousands)Free cash flow: Net cash provided by operating activities$642,825 $159,921 $317,754Purchases of property and equipment(150,510) (105,562) (87,481)Free cash flow (1)$492,315 $54,359 $230,273(1) Free cash flow includes the effect of a $267.5 million payment for aggregate legal settlements for the year ended December 31, 2016. Refer to Note 16 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details.28Table of ContentsAverage contract term. We calculate the average contract term for new customers, upsells and renewals based on the term of those contracts entered into during the period weighted by their ACV. The average new customer contract term was 32 months for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015. The average upsell contract term was 26 months for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015. The average renewal contract term was 27 months, 28 months, and 25 months for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Components of Results of Operations RevenuesSubscription revenues. Subscription revenues are primarily comprised of fees that give customers access to the ordered subscription service, and related support and updates, if any, to the subscription service during the subscription term. Pricing includes multiple instances, hosting and support services, data backup and disaster recovery services, as well as future updates, when and if available, offered during the subscription term. We typically invoice our customers for subscription fees in annual increments upon execution of the initial contract or subsequent renewal. Our contracts are generally non-cancelable during the subscription term, though a customer can terminate for breach if we materially fail to perform. Professional services and other revenues. Professional services revenues consist of fees associated with professional services. Our arrangements for professional services are primarily on a time-and-materials basis. We generally invoice our professional services monthly in arrears based on actual hours and expenses incurred. Other revenues primarily consist of fees from customer training delivered on-site or through publicly available classes and registration and sponsorship fees for our annual Knowledge user conference and other user forums. Typical payment terms require our customers to pay us within 30 days of invoice. We generate sales directly through our sales team and, to a lesser extent, through our resale partners. Revenues from our direct sales organization represented 88% of our total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 and 89% of our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015. We make sales to our resale partners at a discount and record those revenues at the discounted price when all revenue recognition criteria have been met. From time to time, other third parties provide us referrals for which we pay a referral fee. We include revenues associated with these referrals as part of revenues from our direct sales organization. Referral fees paid to these third parties are between 5% and 15% of the customer's ACV, depending on the level of activity these third parties perform in the sales process. We include these fees in sales and marketing expense.Allocation of Overhead CostsOverhead costs associated with office facilities, IT and certain depreciation related to infrastructure that is not dedicated for customer use or research and development use are allocated to cost of revenues and operating expenses based on headcount. Cost of RevenuesCost of subscription revenues. Cost of subscription revenues consists primarily of expenses related to hosting our services and providing support to our customers. These expenses are comprised of data center capacity costs, which include facility costs associated with our data centers as well as interconnectivity between data centers, depreciation related to our infrastructure hardware equipment dedicated for customer use, amortization of intangible assets and personnel-related costs directly associated with data center operations and customer support, including salaries, benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation and allocated overhead.Cost of professional services and other revenues. Cost of professional services and other revenues consists primarily of personnel-related costs directly associated with our professional services and training departments, including salaries, benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation, the costs of contracted third-party partners, travel expenses and allocated overhead.Professional services are performed directly by our services team, as well as by contracted third-party partners. Fees paid to third-party partners are primarily recognized as cost of revenues as the professional services are delivered. Cost of revenues associated with our professional services engagements contracted with third-party partners as a percentage of professional services and other revenues was 19% for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 and 21% for the year ended December 31, 2015. Sales and MarketingSales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel-related expenses directly associated with our sales and marketing staff, including salaries, benefits, bonuses, commissions and stock-based compensation. Sales and marketing expenses also include third-party referral fees, expenses related to our annual Knowledge user conference, other marketing program expenses, which include events other than Knowledge, and costs associated with purchasing advertising and marketing data, and allocated overhead.29Table of ContentsResearch and Development Research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel-related expenses directly associated with our research and development staff, including salaries, benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation and allocated overhead. Research and development expenses also include data center capacity costs, costs associated with outside services contracted for research and development purposes, amortization of intangible assets and depreciation of infrastructure hardware equipment that is used solely for research and development purposes. General and Administrative General and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel-related expenses for our executive, finance, legal, human resources, facilities and administrative personnel, including salaries, benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation, external legal, accounting and other professional services fees, other corporate expenses, amortization of intangible assets and allocated overhead. Legal SettlementsLegal settlements consist of one-time aggregate charges related to the settlement agreements with Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (HPE) and BMC Software, Inc. (BMC). Refer to Note 16 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details regarding these matters.Provision for Income TaxesProvision for income taxes consists of federal, state and foreign income taxes. Due to cumulative losses, we maintain a valuation allowance against our U.S. deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2017 and 2016. We consider all available evidence, both positive and negative, including but not limited to earnings history, projected future outcomes, industry and market trends and the nature of each of the deferred tax assets in assessing the extent to which a valuation allowance should be applied against our U.S. deferred tax assets.30Table of ContentsResults of Operations To enhance comparability, the following table sets forth our results of operations for the periods presented.

Our expectations for 2018 revenues, cost of revenues and operating expenses, including the comparison period amounts used to derive the expected trends are based on the new Topic 606 revenue recognition standard. In addition, our expectations for 2018 revenues, cost of revenues and operating expenses are based on foreign exchange rates as of December 31, 2017. Refer to Note 2 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for details regarding Topic 606, including adjusted amounts for historical periods.Revenues Year Ended December 31, % Change 2017 2016 (dollars in thousands) Revenues: Subscription$1,739,795 $1,221,639 42%Professional services and other193,231 168,874 14%Total revenues$1,933,026 $1,390,513 39%Percentage of revenues: Subscription90% 88% Professional services and other10 12 Total100% 100% Subscription revenues increased $518.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the prior year, driven by our upsells and an increase in customer count. We expect subscription revenues to grow in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total revenues in the year ended December 31, 2018 as we continue to add new customers and upsell to existing customers. Subscription revenues consist of the following: Year Ended December 31, % Change 2017 2016 (dollars in thousands) Service management products$1,526,382 $1,108,846 38%ITOM products213,413 112,793 89%Total subscription revenues$1,739,795 $1,221,639 42%Our service management products include our platform, ITSM, ITBM, customer service management, HR service delivery and security operations, which have similar features and functions and are generally priced on a per user basis. Our ITOM products, which improve visibility, availability and agility of enterprise services, are generally priced on a per node basis. Professional services and other revenues increased $24.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the prior year, due to an increase in the services provided to our growing customer base. Included within our total professional services and other revenues are the revenues from our annual Knowledge user conference, which increased to $17.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $12.8 million in the prior year, due to an increase in registration and sponsorship fees in the current year. We expect professional services and other revenues under Topic 606 for the year ending December 31, 2018 to remain flat in absolute dollar terms when compared to professional services and other revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017, as adjusted for Topic 606. This reflects our plan to focus on deploying our internal professional services organization as a strategic resource while relying on our partner ecosystem to contract directly with customers for service delivery. As described above under the section entitled “New Revenue Recognition Standard under Topic 606,” with the adoption of Topic 606, proceeds from Knowledge and other user forums will be classified as a reduction in sales and marketing expense instead of as professional services and other revenues. 33Table of ContentsOur international operations have provided and will continue to provide a significant portion of our total revenues. Revenues outside North America represented 33% and 32% of total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Because we primarily transact in foreign currencies for sales outside of the United States, the general weakening of the U.S. Dollar relative to other major foreign currencies (primarily the Euro and British Pound Sterling) from the year ended December 31, 2016 to the year ended December 31, 2017 had a favorable impact on our revenues. For entities reporting in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar, if we had translated our results for the year ended December 31, 2017 at the average exchange rates in effect for the year ended December 31, 2016 rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the period, our reported subscription revenues would have been $6.3 million lower. The impact from the foreign currency movements from the year ended December 31, 2016 to the year ended December 31, 2017 is not material to professional services and other revenues.Cost of Revenues and Gross Profit Percentage Year Ended December 31, % Change 2017 2016 (dollars in thousands) Cost of revenues: Subscription$315,570 $235,414 34%Professional services and other184,202 163,268 13%Total cost of revenues$499,772 $398,682 25%Gross profit percentage: Subscription82% 81% Professional services and other5% 3% Total gross profit percentage74% 71% Gross profit:$1,433,254 $991,831 45%Headcount (at period end) Subscription936 729 28%Professional services and other562 496 13%Total headcount1,498 1,225 22% Cost of subscription revenues increased $80.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the prior year, primarily due to increased headcount resulting in an increase of $30.8 million in personnel-related costs excluding stock-based compensation, an increase of $8.0 million in other overhead expenses and an increase of $6.9 million in stock-based compensation. In addition, there was an increase of $17.8 million in depreciation expense primarily due to purchases of infrastructure hardware equipment for our data centers, an increase of $7.2 million in data center capacity costs primarily due to the addition of new data centers and the expansion of existing data centers, and an increase of $2.3 million in amortization of intangibles as a result of acquisitions. Service and technical support agreement and software subscription costs increased $5.0 million, and outside service costs increased $1.2 million during year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the prior year. Our subscription gross profit percentage increased to 82% for the year ended December 31, 2017, from 81% for the year ended December 31, 2016, due to improved data center utilization and economies of scale. We expect our cost of subscription revenues to increase in absolute dollar terms as we provide subscription services to more customers and increase the number of users within our customer instances, but we expect such increase to be at a slower rate than the increase in our subscription revenues, leading to a slight increase in our subscription gross profit percentage for the year ended December 31, 2018 as we continue to leverage the investments we have made in our existing data center infrastructure. To the extent future acquisitions are consummated, our cost of subscription revenues may increase due to additional non-cash charges associated with the amortization of intangible assets acquired. Cost of professional services and other revenues increased $20.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the prior year, primarily due to increased headcount resulting in an increase of $11.7 million in personnel-related costs excluding stock-based compensation, an increase of $2.1 million in overhead expenses, and an increase of $1.0 million in stock-based compensation. Outside service costs increased $4.6 million during year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the prior year, primarily due to increased utilization of contracted third-party partners for the implementation and configuration of our subscription services.34Table of ContentsOur professional services and other gross profit percentage increased to 5% during the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to 3% in the prior year, primarily due to the increase in revenues from our annual Knowledge user conference. Costs associated with Knowledge are included in sales and marketing expense. Knowledge contributed $17.1 million, or 10 percentage points, to the professional services and other gross profit percentage for the year ended December 31, 2017. Knowledge contributed $12.8 million, or 8 percentage points, to the professional services and other gross profit percentage for the year ended December 31, 2016. The impact from the foreign currency movements from the year ended December 31, 2016 to the year ended December 31, 2017 is not material to cost of revenues.

Commissions and referral fee expenses amounted to 7% of subscription revenues for each of the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. Expenses related to our annual Knowledge user conference increased $8.2 million, from $24.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $32.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, due to a 29% increase in registrations year-over-year. Other marketing program expenses, which include expenses related to events other than Knowledge and costs associated with purchasing advertising and marketing data, increased $17.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the prior year. Outside services increased $7.0 million primarily due to an increase in contractors and professional fees to support our sales and marketing functions.Because we primarily transact in foreign currencies for sales and marketing expenses outside of the United States, the general weakening of the U.S. Dollar relative to other major foreign currencies from the year ended December 31, 2016 to the year ended December 31, 2017 had an unfavorable impact on our sales and marketing expenses. For entities reporting in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar, if we had translated our results for the year ended December 31, 2017 at the average exchange rates in effect for the year ended December 31, 2016 rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the period, our sales and marketing expenses would have been $2.5 million lower. We expect sales and marketing expenses to increase for the year ended December 31, 2018 in absolute dollar terms when compared to sales and marketing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017, as adjusted for Topic 606, but decrease slightly as a percentage of total revenues as we continue to expand our direct sales force, increase our marketing activities, grow our international operations, build brand awareness and sponsor additional marketing events. As described above under the section entitled “New Revenue Recognition Standard under Topic 606,” with the adoption of Topic 606, proceeds from Knowledge and other user forums will be classified as a reduction in sales and marketing expense instead of professional services and other revenues. 35Table of ContentsResearch and Development Year Ended December 31 % Change 2017 2016 (dollars in thousands) Research and development$377,518 $285,239 32%Percentage of revenues19% 21% Headcount (at period end)1,419 1,054 35% Research and development expenses increased $92.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the prior year, primarily due to increased headcount resulting in an increase of $60.2 million in personnel-related costs excluding stock-based compensation, an increase of $14.4 million in overhead expenses, and an increase of $10.3 million in stock-based compensation. Outside services increased $3.6 million primarily due to an increase in contractors and consultants that support our research and development functions. Research and development expenses also increased $1.8 million due to depreciation of infrastructure hardware equipment that are used solely for research and development purposes. Because we primarily transact in foreign currencies for research and development expenses outside of the United States, the general weakening of the U.S. Dollar relative to other major foreign currencies from the year ended December 31, 2016 to the year ended December 31, 2017 had an unfavorable impact on our research and development expenses. For entities reporting in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar, if we had translated our results for the year ended December 31, 2017 at the average exchange rates in effect for the year ended December 31, 2016 rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the period, our research and development expenses would have been $1.3 million lower. We expect research and development expenses to increase for the year ended December 31, 2018 in absolute dollar terms, but decrease slightly as a percentage of total revenues as we continue to improve the existing functionality of our services, develop new applications to fill market needs and enhance our core platform.36Table of ContentsGeneral and Administrative Year Ended December 31 % Change 2017 2016 (dollars in thousands) General and administrative$210,533 $158,936 32%Percentage of revenues11% 11% Headcount (at period end)892 647 38% General and administrative expenses increased $51.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the prior year, primarily due to increased headcount resulting in an increase of $22.4 million in personnel-related costs excluding stock-based compensation, an increase of $19.3 million in stock-based compensation, and an increase of $2.3 million in overhead expenses. Software subscription costs increased $4.6 million, and outside services costs, which include costs related to contractors and consultants, increased $2.3 million to support our administrative function. Amortization of intangibles increased $1.5 million, and acquisition-related costs increased $1.4 million from acquisitions in 2017. The impact from the foreign currency movements from the year ended December 31, 2016 to the year ended December 31, 2017 is not material to general and administrative expenses.We expect general and administrative expenses to increase for the year ended December 31, 2018 in absolute dollar terms as we continue to hire new employees, but remain relatively flat as a percentage of total revenues as we continue to grow.

Stock-based compensation expense is inherently difficult to forecast due to fluctuations in our stock price. Based upon our stock price as of December 31, 2017, we expect stock-based compensation expense to continue to increase for the year ended December 31, 2018 in absolute dollar terms, but decrease as a percentage of total revenues as we continue to grow.

During the year ended December 31, 2018, we expect to incur approximately $63.3 million in amortization expense of debt discount and issuance costs related to the convertible notes.

Interest income and other income (expense), net decreased $0.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the prior year, primarily due to increased foreign exchange loss, partially offset by increased interest income. Foreign exchange losses increased $8.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the prior year as a result of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Interest income increased $8.1 million due to the higher cash balances and higher yields on our invested balances during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the prior year.38Table of ContentsOur expanding international operations will continue to increase our exposure to currency risks, though we cannot presently predict the impact of this exposure on our consolidated financial statements. While we have not engaged in the hedging of our foreign currency transactions to date, we currently expect to initiate a hedging program to hedge selected significant transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar in 2018.

Our tax expense decreased $1.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the prior year, primarily due to the tax effects of unrealized gains in investment securities. See Note 15 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for our reconciliation of income taxes at the statutory federal rate to the provision for income taxes.On December 22, 2017, the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act) was enacted into law, changing how the U.S. imposes income tax on multinational corporations. Significant changes include, but are not limited to, a reduction of the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, a transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings, and a transition from a worldwide to a territorial tax system. We are required to recognize the effect of the Tax Act in the period of enactment, such as remeasuring our U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities as well as reassessing the net realizability of our deferred tax assets and liabilities. In December 2017, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (SAB 118), which allows us to record provisional amounts during a measurement period not to extend more than one year beyond the Tax Act enactment date. Since the Tax Act was passed late in the fourth quarter of 2017, and ongoing guidance and accounting interpretation are expected over the next 12 months, we consider the accounting for deferred tax remeasurements, the impact of the transition of U.S. international taxation from a worldwide tax system to a territorial system, and other provisions to be incomplete due to the forthcoming guidance and our ongoing analysis. We expect to complete our analysis within the measurement period in accordance with SAB 118.We continue to maintain a full valuation allowance on our U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets, and the significant components of the tax expense recorded are current cash taxes payable in various jurisdictions. The cash tax expenses are impacted by each jurisdiction’s individual tax rates, laws on timing of recognition of income and deductions, and availability of net operating losses and tax credits. Given the full valuation allowance, sensitivity of current cash taxes to local rules and our foreign structuring, we expect that our effective tax rate could fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis and could be adversely affected to the extent earnings are lower than anticipated in countries that have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher statutory rates. Prior to the enactment of the Tax Act, we considered earnings from foreign operations to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the United States. We are currently evaluating whether to change our indefinite reinvestment assertion in light of the Tax Act and consider that assessment to be incomplete as permitted under guidance issued by the SEC. We expect to reach a final determination within the measurement period described above.39Table of ContentsNet Loss Year Ended December 31 % Change 2017 2016 (dollars in thousands) Net loss$(149,130) $(451,804) (67)%Percentage of revenues(8)% (32)% Net loss decreased $302.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily reflecting the settlement agreements we entered into with HPE and BMC during the prior year. Refer to Note 16 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details. We expect to continue to incur a GAAP loss for the year ended December 31, 2018, due to increased costs and expenses including non-cash charges associated with equity awards, amortization of purchased intangibles from acquisitions, and other expenses.

In addition, revenues from our annual Knowledge user conference increased to $12.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $10.9 million in the prior year, due to increased sponsorship and paid registrations in the current year. 40Table of ContentsOur international operations have provided and will continue to provide a significant portion of our total revenues. Revenues outside North America represented 32% and 30% of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Because we primarily transact in foreign currencies for sales outside of the United States, the general strengthening of the U.S. Dollar relative to other major foreign currencies (primarily Euro and the British Pound Sterling) from the year ended December 31, 2015 to the year ended December 31, 2016 had an unfavorable impact on our revenues. For entities reporting in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar, if we had translated our results for the year ended December 31, 2016 at the average exchange rates in effect for the year ended December 31, 2015 rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the period, our subscription revenues would have increased by an additional $6.3 million. The impact from the foreign currency movements from the year ended December 31, 2015 to the year ended December 31, 2016 is not material to professional services and other revenues.Cost of Revenues and Gross Profit Percentage Year Ended December 31, % Change 2016 2015 (dollars in thousands) Cost of revenues: Subscription$235,414 $183,400 28%Professional services and other163,268 146,013 12%Total cost of revenues$398,682 $329,413 21%Gross profit percentage: Subscription81% 78% Professional services and other3% 7% Total gross profit percentage71% 67% Gross profit:$991,831 $676,067 47%Headcount (at period end) Subscription729 579 26%Professional services and other496 486 2%Total headcount1,225 1,065 15% Cost of subscription revenues increased $52.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the prior year, primarily due to increased headcount resulting in an increase of $17.3 million in personnel-related costs excluding stock-based compensation, an increase of $5.0 million in stock-based compensation, and an increase of $7.2 million in other overhead expenses. In addition, there was an increase of $10.3 million in depreciation expense primarily due to purchases of infrastructure hardware equipment for our data centers, an increase of $5.3 million in data center capacity costs primarily due to the expansion of our data centers, and an increase of $1.5 million in amortization of intangible assets as a result of acquisitions in 2016. Our subscription gross profit percentage increased to 81% for the year ended December 31, 2016, from 78% for the year ended December 31, 2015, due to improved data center utilization and economies of scale. Cost of professional services and other revenues increased $17.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the prior year, primarily due to increased headcount resulting in an increase of $8.0 million in personnel-related costs excluding stock-based compensation, an increase of $3.2 million in stock-based compensation, and an increase of $3.4 million in overhead expenses.Our professional services and other gross profit percentage decreased to 3% during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to 7% in the prior year, due to lower utilization rates as we invested in specialized resources to support our newer products and higher growth rate in our stock-based compensation of 14% compared to the growth rate in our professional services and other revenues of 7%, partially offset by the increase in revenues from our annual Knowledge user conference. Costs associated with Knowledge are included in sales and marketing expense. Knowledge contributed $12.8 million, or 8 percentage points, to the professional services and other gross profit percentage for the year ended December 31, 2016. Knowledge contributed $10.9 million, or 7 percentage points, to the professional services and other gross profit percentage for the year ended December 31, 2015. 41Table of ContentsBecause we primarily transact in foreign currencies for cost of revenues outside of the United States, the general strengthening of the U.S. Dollar relative to other major foreign currencies from the year ended December 31, 2015 to the year ended December 31, 2016 had a favorable impact on our cost of revenues. For entities reporting in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar, if we had translated our results for the year ended December 31, 2016 at the average exchange rates in effect for the year ended December 31, 2015 rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the year ended December 31, 2016, our cost of subscription revenues would have increased by an additional $3.3 million and our cost of professional services and other revenues would have increased by an additional $1.6 million.

We sign a significantly higher percentage of agreements with new customers, as well as renewal agreements with existing customers, in the quarter ended December 31. The increase in customer agreements for the quarter ended December 31 is primarily a result of the terms of our commission plans, which incentivize our direct sales force to meet their annual quotas by December 31, and large enterprise account buying patterns typical in the software industry, which are driven primarily by the expiration of annual authorized budgeted expenditures. Furthermore, we usually sign a significant portion of these agreements during the last month, and often the last two weeks, of each quarter. This seasonality in the timing of entering into customer contracts is sometimes not immediately apparent in our billings due to the fact that we exclude contracts with a future start date from our billings. Similarly, this seasonality is reflected to a much lesser extent, and sometimes is not immediately apparent in our revenues, due to the fact that we recognize subscription revenues over the term of the subscription agreement, which is generally 12 to 36 months. Although these seasonal factors are common in the technology industry, historical patterns should not be considered a reliable indicator of our future sales activity or performance. Our revenues have increased over the periods presented due to increased sales to new customers, as well as upsells to existing customers. Our operating expenses have increased over the periods presented primarily due to increases in headcount and other related expenses to support our growth. We have historically seen an increase in marketing expenses in the quarter ended June 30, and a corresponding decrease in marketing expenses in the quarter ended September 30 due to the expenses incurred for our annual Knowledge user conference. Marketing expenses in the quarter ended December 31 are also historically higher due to user forums we conduct in that quarter. We anticipate operating expenses will continue to increase in future periods as we continue to focus on investing in the long-term growth of our business.Our free cash flow is impacted by the timing of collections and disbursements, including the timing of capital expenditures. We have historically seen higher collections in the quarter ended March 31 due to seasonality in timing of entering into customer contracts as described above.Liquidity and Capital Resources Our principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents, investments, and cash generated from operations. As of December 31, 2017, we had $1.8 billion in cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, of which $250.6 million represented cash held by foreign subsidiaries. $191.5 million of the $1.8 billion are denominated in currencies other than U.S. Dollar. In addition, we had $391.4 million in long-term investments that provide additional capital resources. We do not anticipate that we will need funds generated from foreign operations to fund our domestic operations.Prior to the enactment of the Tax Act, we considered earnings from foreign operations to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the United States. We are currently evaluating whether to change our indefinite reinvestment assertion in light of the Tax Act and consider that assessment to be incomplete as permitted under guidance issued by the SEC. We expect to reach a final determination within the measurement period in accordance with SAB 118.In November 2013, we issued the 2018 Notes with an aggregate principal amount of $575.0 million. The 2018 Notes mature on November 1, 2018 unless converted or repurchased in accordance with their terms prior to such date. In connection with the issuance of the 2018 Notes, we entered into the 2018 Note Hedge transactions and 2018 Warrant transactions with certain financial institutions (the option counterparties). We may elect to settle the 2018 Notes in cash, shares of our common stock, or a combination of cash and shares. If the 2018 Note Hedges are exercised, we may elect to receive cash, shares of our common stock, or a combination of cash and shares. The price of our common stock was greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price of the 2018 Notes for at least 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the quarters ended June 30, 2017, September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2017. Therefore, the 2018 Notes first became convertible at the holders’ option beginning on July 1, 2017 and continue to be convertible at the holders' option through March 31, 2018. The impact of the conversion of the 2018 Notes on our liquidity will depend on the settlement method we elect for each instrument described above. We currently intend to settle the principal amount of any converted 2018 Notes in cash. 47Table of ContentsDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, we paid cash to settle an immaterial principal amount of the 2018 Notes due to early conversion requests. Based on additional conversion requests we have received through the filing date, we expect to settle in cash an aggregate of $37.3 million in principal amount of the 2018 Notes during the first quarter of 2018 and $7.3 million in principal amount of the 2018 Notes during the second quarter of 2018. We may receive additional conversion requests that require settlement in the second quarter or the remainder of the year 2018.In May and June 2017, we issued the 2022 Notes with an aggregate principal amount of $782.5 million. We currently intend to use approximately $575.0 million of the net proceeds from the 2022 Notes to repay the 2018 Notes. In connection with the issuance of the 2022 Notes, we entered into the 2022 Note Hedge transactions and 2022 Warrant transactions with certain financial institutions. Refer to Note 9 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements and the risk factors included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on the 2022 Notes, the 2022 Notes Hedges and the 2022 Warrants. In addition, in May 2017, we used approximately $55.0 million of the net proceeds from the 2022 Notes to repurchase shares of our common stock sold by certain purchasers of the 2022 Notes, and during the three months ended June 30, 2017, we used approximately $73.9 million to pay the cost of the 2022 Note Hedges (after such cost was partially offset by the proceeds from the issuance of the 2022 Warrants).We anticipate our current cash and cash equivalents balance and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs, including the repayment of our 2018 Notes, expansion of data centers, lease obligations, expenditures related to the growth of our headcount and the acquisition of fixed assets, intangibles, and investments in office facilities, to accommodate our growth for at least the next 12 months. Whether these resources are adequate to meet our liquidity needs beyond that period will depend on our growth, operating results, cash utilized for acquisitions and/or debt retirements if any are consummated, and the capital expenditures required to meet possible increased demand for our services. If we require additional capital resources to grow our business at any time in the future, we may seek to finance our operations from the current funds available or seek additional equity or debt financing. Year Ended December 31, 2017 2016 2015 (dollars in thousands)Net cash provided by operating activities$642,825 $159,921 $317,754Net cash used in investing activities (1)(883,948) (108,238) (231,521)Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities538,892 (55,752) 80,330Net increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash net of foreign currency effect325,897 (10,854) 160,050 (1)During the year ended December 31, 2017, we adopted Accounting Standards Update 2016-18, “Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash,” which requires that amounts generally described as restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows. We have adopted changes to the consolidated statements of cash flows on a retrospective basis. The impact of the adoption for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 is not material.Operating ActivitiesCash provided by operating activities mainly consists of our net loss adjusted for certain non-cash items, including depreciation and amortization, amortization of premiums on investments, amortization of deferred commissions, amortization of issuance cost and debt discount, stock-based compensation, and changes in operating assets and liabilities during the year.Net cash provided by operating activities was $642.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $159.9 million for the prior year. The increase in operating cash flow was primarily due to a decrease in net loss by $302.7 million. The remaining change was due to an increase in non-cash adjustments to reconcile net loss to net cash provided by operations and the favorable impact on operating cash flow from changes in operating assets and liabilities. Net cash provided by operating activities was $159.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $317.8 million for the prior year. The decrease in operating cash flow was primarily due to $267.5 million cash paid for aggregate legal settlements during the year ended December 31, 2016 (refer to Note 16 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details). The remaining change was due to an increase in non-cash adjustments to reconcile net loss to net cash provided by operations and the favorable impact on operating cash flow from changes in operating assets and liabilities. 48Table of Contents Investing ActivitiesNet cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $883.9 million compared to $108.2 million for the prior year. The increase in cash used in investing activities was mainly due to a $714.7 million increase in net purchases of investments, a $44.9 million increase in capital expenditures related to the purchases of infrastructure hardware equipment to support the expansion of our data centers as well as investments in leasehold improvements, furniture and equipment to support our headcount growth, a $23.9 million increase in business combinations, net of cash and restricted cash acquired, and a $4.3 million increase in purchases of strategic investments. The increase in cash used in investing activities was partially offset by a $12.1 million decrease in purchases of other intangibles.Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $108.2 million compared to $231.5 million for the prior year. The decrease in cash used in investing activities was mainly due to a $181.6 million decrease in net purchases of investments and a $10.0 million decrease in the purchases of strategic investments, partially offset by a $33.2 million increase in business combinations, net of cash and restricted cash acquired, a $17.0 million increase in purchases of other intangibles, and a $18.1 million increase in capital expenditures related to the purchase of infrastructure hardware equipment to support the expansion of our data centers as well as investments in leasehold improvements, furniture and equipment to support our headcount growth. Financing Activities Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $538.9 million compared to net cash used in financing activities of $55.8 million for the prior year. The change was primarily due to a $698.2 million increase in net proceeds from issuance of the 2022 Notes and the 2022 Note Hedge and 2022 Warrant transactions entered into during the year ended December 31, 2017 and a $16.2 million increase in proceeds from employee stock plans, partially offset by a $62.0 million increase in taxes paid related to net share settlement of equity awards and a $55.0 million increase in cash used to repurchase shares of our common stock. Net cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $55.8 million compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $80.3 million for the prior year. The change was primarily due to a $107.1 million increase in taxes paid related to net share settlement of equity awards as a result of a policy change to net settle shares for all U.S. employees starting in 2016 and a $27.0 million decrease in proceeds from employee stock plans due to a reduction in the number of stock options issued in the last four years.49Table of ContentsContractual Obligations and CommitmentsThe following table represents our future non-cancelable contractual obligations as of December 31, 2017, aggregated by type: Payments Due by Period Total LessThan1 Year 1 – 3Years 3 – 5Years MoreThan5 Years (in thousands)Operating leases (1)$353,859 $44,713 $96,204 $88,828 $124,114Purchase obligations (2)80,974 31,394 34,434 11,053 4,093Principal amount payable on our convertible senior notes (3)1,357,494 574,994 — 782,500 —Other3,923 574 1,148 1,148 1,053Total contractual obligations$1,796,250 $651,675 $131,786 $883,529 $129,260(1)Consists of future non-cancelable minimum rental payments under operating leases for some of our offices and data centers.(2)Consists of future minimum payments under non-cancelable purchase commitments primarily related to data center and IT operations and sales and marketing activities. Not included in the table above are certain purchase commitments related to our future annual Knowledge user conferences and other customer or sales conferences to be held in 2019 and 2020. If we were to cancel these contractual commitments as of December 31, 2017, we would have been obligated to pay cancellation penalties of approximately $13.9 million in aggregate.(3)For additional information regarding our convertible senior notes, refer to Note 9 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.In addition to the obligations in the table above, approximately $4.8 million of unrecognized tax benefits have been recorded as liabilities as of December 31, 2017. It is uncertain as to if or when such amounts may be settled. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements During all periods presented, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. As such, we are not exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in those types of relationships.Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and EstimatesOur management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. These items are monitored and analyzed by us for changes in facts and circumstances, and material changes in these estimates could occur in the future. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Changes in estimates are reflected in reported results for the period in which they become known. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions and such differences could be material.While our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe that the following accounting policies are critical to the process of making significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our audited consolidated financial statements. Revenue RecognitionWe derive our revenues from two sources: (i) subscriptions and (ii) professional services and other. Subscription revenues are primarily comprised of subscription fees that give customers access to the ordered subscription service, related support and updates, if any, to the subscribed service during the subscription term.50Table of ContentsOur contracts typically do not give the customer the right to take possession of the software supporting the services. Professional services and other revenues consist of fees associated with services provided to customers for process design, implementation, configuration and optimization of our products. Professional services and other revenues also include customer training and registration and sponsorship fees for our annual Knowledge user conference and other user forums.We commence revenue recognition when all of the following conditions are met:•There is persuasive evidence of an arrangement;•The service has been provided to the customer;•The collection of related fees is reasonably assured; and•The amount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable.We use a signed contract together with a signed order form as evidence of an arrangement for a new customer. In subsequent transactions with an existing customer, including an upsell or a renewal, we consider the existing signed contract and either the new signed order form or new purchase order as evidence of an arrangement.We recognize subscription revenues ratably over the contract term beginning on the commencement date of each contract, the date we make our services available to our customers. Once our services are available to customers, we record amounts due in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue. To the extent we bill customers in advance of the contract commencement date, the accounts receivable and corresponding deferred revenue amounts are netted to zero on our consolidated balance sheets, unless such amounts have been paid as of the balance sheet date.Our professional services arrangements are primarily on a time-and-materials basis and revenues on these arrangements are recognized as the services are delivered. Professional services revenues associated with fixed fee arrangements are recognized using a proportional performance model. In instances where certain milestones are required to be met before revenues are recognized, we defer professional services revenues and the associated costs until milestone criteria have been met.We assess collectibility based on a number of factors such as past collection history with the customer and creditworthiness of the customer. If we determine collectibility is not reasonably assured, we defer revenue recognition until collectibility becomes reasonably assured. We assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment. Our arrangements are generally non-cancelable and do not contain refund-type provisions.We have multiple element arrangements comprised of subscription fees and professional services. We account for subscription and professional services revenues as separate units of accounting. To qualify as a separate unit of accounting, the delivered item must have value to the customer on a standalone basis. We have concluded that our subscription service has standalone value as it is routinely sold separately by us. In addition, the applications offered through this subscription service are fully functional without any additional development, modification or customization. We provide customers access to our subscription service at the beginning of the contract term. In determining whether professional services have standalone value, we considered the following factors for each professional services agreement: availability of the services from other vendors, the nature of the professional services, the timing of when the professional services contract was signed in comparison to the subscription service start date and the contractual dependence of the subscription service on the customer’s satisfaction with the professional services work. Our professional services, including implementation and configuration services, are not so unique and complex that other vendors cannot provide them. In some instances, customers independently contract with third-party vendors to do the implementation and we regularly outsource implementation services to contracted third-party vendors. As a result, we concluded professional services, including implementation and configuration services, have standalone value.The total arrangement consideration for a multiple element arrangement is allocated to the identifiable separate units of accounting based on a relative selling price hierarchy. We determined the relative selling price for a deliverable based on its vendor-specific objective evidence (VSOE) of selling price or third-party evidence (TPE) of selling price if VSOE does not exist. If neither VSOE nor TPE of selling price exists for a deliverable, the selling price is determined using the best estimate of selling price (BESP). We determine the BESP for each deliverable primarily by considering the historical selling price of these deliverables in similar transactions as well as other factors, including, but not limited to, market competition, review of stand-alone sales and current pricing practices. In determining the appropriate pricing structure, we consider the available information regarding the competitive pricing of similar products and marketing analysis.51Table of ContentsIn limited circumstances, we grant certain customers the right to deploy our subscription service on the customers’ own servers. These arrangements are subject to software revenue recognition guidance since the customer deploys our software. As we never sell the non-software elements separately from the software elements, we have determined that we do not have sufficient VSOE of fair value for all undelivered non-software elements. Consequently, we defer all revenue and related costs under the arrangement until the last element in the transaction has been delivered or starts to be delivered. Once the delivery of the last element has commenced, we recognize the entire fee and related costs from the arrangement ratably over the remaining period of the arrangement.Deferred revenue consists primarily of payments received in advance of revenue recognition for our subscriptions and professional services and other revenues and is recognized as the revenue recognition criteria are met.Deferred Commissions Deferred commissions are the incremental selling costs that are directly associated with our customer contracts and consist of sales commissions paid to our direct sales force and referral fees paid to independent third-parties. The majority of commissions and referral fees are deferred and amortized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the related customer contracts. We include amortization of deferred commissions in sales and marketing expense in the consolidated statements of comprehensive loss. We believe this is the preferable method of accounting as the commission charges are so closely related to the revenue from the customer contracts that they should be recorded as an asset and charged to expense over the same period that the revenue is recognized. The commission payments are generally paid in full the month after the customer’s initial service under the contract commences. Goodwill, Intangible Assets and Other Long Lived AssetsGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price in a business combination over the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired. The allocation of the purchase price requires us to make significant estimates in determining the fair value of acquired assets and assumed liabilities, especially with respect to intangible assets. These estimates are based upon a number of factors, including historical experience, market conditions and information obtained from the management of the acquired company. Critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets included, but are not limited to, cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future, discount rates, the time and expense that would be necessary to recreate the assets and the profit margin a market participant would receive. These estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates.We evaluate and test the recoverability of goodwill for impairment at least annually during our fourth quarter or more frequently if circumstances indicate that goodwill may not be recoverable. We perform the impairment testing by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of its reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we perform a goodwill impairment test. To calculate any potential impairment, we compare the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. Any excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit's goodwill over its fair value is recognized as an impairment loss, and the carrying value of goodwill is written down. We have determined that we have a single reporting unit. We have not recognized any impairment charges related to goodwill during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 because the aggregate fair value of our company has consistently and materially exceeded the carrying value of our single reporting unit.We periodically review the carrying amounts of long-lived assets, such as property and equipment, and purchased intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. We measure the recoverability of these assets by comparing the carrying amount of each asset to the future undiscounted cash flows we expect the asset to generate. If we consider any of these assets to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized equals the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. In addition, we periodically evaluate the estimated remaining useful lives of long-lived assets to determine whether events or changes in circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of depreciation or amortization. Our intangible assets are amortized over their useful lives ranging from 18 months to ten years.Screening for and assessing whether impairment indicators exist or if events or changes in circumstances have occurred, including market conditions, operating fundamentals, competition and general economic conditions, requires significant judgment. Additionally, changes in the technology industry occur frequently and quickly. Therefore, there can be no assurance that a charge to operating expenses will not occur as a result of future goodwill, intangible assets and other long-lived assets impairment tests.52Table of Contents Stock-based Compensation We recognize compensation expense related to stock options and restricted stock units (RSUs) on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting term of four years. For RSUs granted with a performance condition, the expenses are recognized on a graded vesting basis over the vesting period, after assessing the probability of achieving requisite performance criteria. This has the impact of greater stock-based compensation expense during the initial years of the vesting period as stock-based compensation cost is recognized over the requisite service period for each separately vesting tranche of the award as though the award were, in substance, multiple awards. We recognize compensation expense related to shares issued pursuant to the employee stock purchase plan (ESPP) on a straight-line basis over the offering period. We estimate the fair value of options using the Black-Scholes options pricing model and fair value of RSU awards using the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant. We recognize compensation expense net of estimated forfeiture activity, which is based on historical forfeiture rates. We evaluate the forfeiture rates at least annually or when events or circumstances indicate a change may be needed. This may cause a fluctuation in our stock-based compensation in the period of change.Income Taxes We use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes, in which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. We measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be reversed. We recognize the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates as income and expense in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is established if it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. In determining the need for a valuation allowance, we consider future growth, forecasted earnings, future taxable income, the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate, historical earnings, taxable income in prior years, if carryback is permitted under the law, carryforward periods and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies.Our tax positions are subject to income tax audits by multiple tax jurisdictions throughout the world. We recognize the tax benefit of an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not the position is sustainable upon examination by the taxing authority, based on the technical merits. We measure the tax benefit recognized as the largest amount of benefit which is more likely than not to be realized upon settlement with the taxing authority. We recognize interest accrued and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in our tax provision. Significant judgment is required to evaluate uncertain tax positions. Our evaluations are based upon a number of factors, including changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law or guidance, correspondence with tax authorities during the course of audits and effective settlement of audit issues. Changes in the recognition or measurement of uncertain tax positions could result in material increases or decreases in our income tax expense in the period in which we make the change, which could have a material impact on our effective tax rate and operating results.We calculate the current and deferred income tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed in subsequent years and record adjustments based on filed income tax returns when identified. The amount of income taxes paid is subject to examination by U.S. federal, state and foreign tax authorities. The estimate of the potential outcome of any uncertain tax issue is subject to management’s assessment of relevant risks, facts and circumstances existing at that time. To the extent the assessment of such tax position changes, we record the change in estimate in the period in which we make the determination.New Accounting PronouncementsOn December 22, 2017, the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act) was enacted into law and significantly changed how the U.S. imposes income tax on multinational corporations. Changes include, but are not limited to, a reduction of the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, a transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings, and a transition from a worldwide to a territorial tax system. We are required to recognize the effect of the Tax Act in the period of enactment, such as remeasuring our U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities as well as reassessing the net realizability of our deferred tax assets and liabilities. In December 2017, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (SAB 118), which allows us to record provisional amounts during a measurement period not to extend more than one year beyond the Tax Act enactment date. Since the Tax Act was passed late in the fourth quarter of 2017, and ongoing guidance and accounting interpretation are expected over the next 12 months, we consider the accounting for deferred tax remeasurements, the impact of the transition of U.S. international taxation from a worldwide tax system to a territorial system and other provisions to be incomplete due to the forthcoming guidance and our ongoing analysis. We expect to complete our analysis within the measurement period in accordance with SAB 118.53Table of ContentsIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued a new standard related to revenue recognition from contracts with customers (Topic 606), which is effective beginning January 1, 2018. Topic 606 supersedes the prior revenue recognition standard (Topic 605). Under Topic 606, for our on‑premises offerings, we will recognize a portion of the subscription revenue when the on-premises offering is made available, resulting in a larger amount of upfront subscription revenue, and a smaller amount of deferred revenue compared with Topic 605, which required ratable revenue recognition over the contract period. Due to the complexity of certain customer contracts, the actual revenue recognition treatment required under Topic 606 will depend on contract-specific terms and may result in greater variability in revenue from period to period. Under Topic 606, we will defer all incremental commission costs to obtain customer contracts, including indirect costs that are not tied to a specific contract. On initial contracts, only the portion equivalent to a renewal commission will be amortized over the contract term, while the portion incremental to a renewal commission will be amortized over a period of benefit that we have determined to be five years. On renewal contracts, these costs will be amortized over the renewal term. Additionally, for our on-premises offerings, consistent with the recognition of subscription revenue for on-premises offerings as described above, a portion of the commission costs will be expensed upfront when the on-premises offering is made available. Under Topic 605, we deferred only direct and incremental commission costs to obtain a contract and amortized those costs over the contract term, which is generally 12 to 36 months.For details regarding these and other recently issued accounting standards, refer to Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.ITEM 7A.QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKForeign Currency Exchange RiskWe have foreign currency risks related to our revenue and operating expenses denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar, primarily the Euro and British Pound Sterling. We are a net receiver of Euro and therefore benefit from a weakening of the U.S. Dollar relative to the Euro and, conversely, are adversely affected by a strengthening of the U.S. Dollar relative to the Euro. Revenues denominated in U.S. Dollar as a percentage of total revenues was 73% during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 and 74% during the year ended December 31, 2015. Changes in exchange rates have recently positively affected, and may continue to positively affect, our total revenues. We have experienced and expect to continue to experience fluctuations in our net loss as a result of transaction gains or losses related to remeasuring monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entities in which they are recorded. We recognized net foreign currency losses of $11.1 million and $2.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. While we have not engaged in the hedging of our foreign currency transactions to date, we may do so in 2018.A hypothetical 10% increase in the U.S. Dollar against other currencies would have resulted in an increase in operating loss of approximately $13.7 million and $7.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The hypothetical increase in operating loss for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 is due to an assumed decrease in the mix of foreign currency revenue relative to foreign currency expenses. This analysis disregards the possibilities that rates can move in opposite directions and that losses from one geographic area may be offset by gains from another geographic area. Interest Rate Sensitivity We had an aggregate of $2.2 billion in cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and long-term investments as of December 31, 2017. This amount was invested primarily in money market funds, time deposits, corporate notes and bonds, government securities and other debt securities with a minimum rating of BBB by Standard & Poor's, Baa2 by Moody's, or BBB by Fitch. The primary objectives of our investment activities are the preservation of capital and support of our liquidity requirements. Our investments are exposed to market risk due to fluctuations in interest rates, which may affect our interest income and the fair market value of our investments. As of December 31, 2017, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would have resulted in an approximate $10.7 million decline of the fair value of our available-for-sale securities. This estimate is based on a sensitivity model that measures market value changes when changes in interest rates occur.54Table of ContentsAs of December 31, 2016, we had an aggregate of $1.2 billion in cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and long-term investments, and a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would have resulted in an approximate $5.7 million decline of the fair value of our available-for-sale securities. Market RiskIn November 2013, we issued the 2018 Notes with an aggregate principal amount of $575.0 million, and in May and June 2017, we issued the 2022 Notes with an aggregate principal amount of $782.5 million. We carry these instruments at face value less unamortized discount on our consolidated balance sheet. Because these instruments does not bear interest, we have no financial statement risk associated with changes in interest rates. However, the fair value of fixed rate instruments fluctuates when interest rates change, and in the case of convertible notes, when the market price of our stock fluctuates.We hold cash balances with multiple financial institutions in various countries and these balances routinely exceed deposit insurance limits.As of December 31, 2017, we had $5.8 million invested in privately-held companies that are in the development stage. The fair value of these investments may fluctuate depending on the financial condition and near-term prospects of these companies, and we may be required to record an impairment charge if the carrying value of these investments exceed their fair value.55Table of Contents",2023-12-30 18:26:52.984545
1373715,NOW,"ServiceNow, Inc.",2019,"ITEM 7.MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes appearing under “Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in Item 8 of this filing. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this filing, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. You should carefully read the “Risk Factors” section of this filing for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results and the timing of certain events to differ materially from future results expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.Our billings and free cash flow measures included in the sections entitled “—Key Business Metrics—Billings,” and “—Key Business Metrics—Free Cash Flow” are not in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). These non-GAAP financial measures are not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. These measures may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, limiting their usefulness for comparison purposes. We encourage investors to carefully consider our results under GAAP, as well as our supplemental non-GAAP results, to more fully understand our business.30Table of ContentsOverview ServiceNow, the company that makes work, work better for people, is a leading provider of enterprise cloud computing services that define, structure, manage and automate digital workflows for global enterprises. We deliver digital workflows that help our customers create great experiences and unlock productivity. We typically deliver our software via the Internet as a service, through an easy-to-use, consumer product-like interface, which means it can be easily configured and rapidly deployed. In a minority of cases, customers deploy our software internally or contract with a third party to host the software to support their unique regulatory or security requirements.We generally offer our services on an annual subscription fee basis, which includes access to the ordered subscription service and related support, including updates to the subscription service during the subscription term. Pricing for our subscription services is based on a number of factors, including duration of subscription term, volume, mix of products purchased, and discounts. We generate sales through our direct sales team and, to a lesser extent, indirectly through resale partners and third-party referrals. We also generate revenues from professional services and for training of customer and partner personnel. We generally bill our customers annually in advance for subscription services and monthly in arrears for our professional services as the work is performed.A majority of our revenues come from large global enterprise customers. We continue to invest in the development of our services, infrastructure and sales and marketing to drive long-term growth. We increased our overall employee headcount to 8,154 as of December 31, 2018 from 6,222 as of December 31, 2017.Key Business Metrics Number of customers with ACV greater than $1 million. We count the total number of customers with annualized contract value (ACV) greater than $1 million as of the end of the period. We had 678, 508, and 354 customers with ACV greater than $1 million as of December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. For purposes of customer count, a customer is defined as an entity with a unique Dunn & Bradstreet Global Ultimate (GULT), Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number and an active subscription contract as of the measurement date. The DUNS number is a global standard for business identification and tracking. We make exceptions for holding companies, government entities and other organizations for which the GULT, in our judgment, does not accurately represent the ServiceNow customer. For example, while all U.S. government agencies roll up to “Government of the United States” under the GULT, we count each government agency that we contract with as a separate customer. Our customer count is subject to adjustments for acquisitions, spin-offs and other market activity. Previously disclosed number of customers with ACV greater than $1 million as well as our average contract term calculations are restated to allow for comparability. ACV is calculated based on the foreign exchange rate in effect at the time the contract was signed. Foreign exchange rate fluctuations could cause some variability in the number of customers with ACV greater than $1 million.Renewal rate. We calculate our renewal rate by subtracting our attrition rate from 100%. Our attrition rate for a period is equal to the ACV from customers lost during the period, divided by the sum of (i) the total ACV from all customers that renewed during the period, excluding changes in price or users, and (ii) the total ACV from all customers lost during the period. Accordingly, our renewal rate is calculated based on ACV and is not based on the number of customers that have renewed. Further, our renewal rate does not reflect increased or decreased purchases from our customers to the extent such customers are not lost customers. A lost customer is a customer that did not renew an expiring contract and that, in our judgment, will not be renewed. Typically, a customer that reduces its subscription upon renewal is not considered a lost customer. However, in instances where the subscription decrease represents the majority of the customer’s ACV, we may deem the renewal as a lost customer. For our renewal rate calculation, we define a customer as an entity with a separate production instance of our service and an active subscription contract as of the measurement date, instead of an entity with a unique GULT or DUNS number. We adjust our renewal rate for acquisitions, consolidations and other customer events that cause the merging of two or more accounts occurring at the time of renewal. Previously disclosed renewal rates may be restated to reflect such adjustments to allow for comparability. Our renewal rate was 98%, for each of the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2016, and 97% for the year ended December 31, 2017. As our renewal rate is impacted by the timing of renewals, which could occur in advance of, or subsequent to the original contract end date, period-to-period comparison of renewal rates may not be meaningful.Total backlog. Total backlog consists of unbilled backlog, deferred revenue and customer deposits. Unbilled backlog is an operational measure representing future unearned revenue amounts believed to be firm that are to be invoiced under our existing agreements and are not included in the deferred revenue or customer deposits on our consolidated balance sheets. In our previous Annual Reports on Form 10-K, we referred to unbilled backlog as “backlog.” We believe total backlog is a useful measure of customer adoption of our services. 31Table of ContentsAs of December 31, 2018, our total backlog was $5.1 billion, of which $3.4 billion was unbilled backlog and $1.7 billion was deferred revenue and customer deposits. Of this total backlog, we expect to recognize approximately 50% in revenues over the 12 months following December 31, 2018, with the balance to be recognized thereafter.As of December 31, 2017, our total backlog was $3.8 billion, of which $2.5 billion was unbilled backlog and $1.7 billion was deferred revenue and customer deposits, which reflects the impact of the full retrospective adoption of Topic 606. For the disclosure of unbilled backlog prior to the adoption of Topic 606, see the section entitled “Business” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 filed on February 28, 2018.We expect total backlog to fluctuate due to a number of factors, including the timing, duration and size of customer contracts, the mix of cloud and self-hosted offerings and foreign exchange rate fluctuations.Billings. We define billings, a non-GAAP financial measure, as revenues recognized plus the change in total unbilled receivables, deferred revenue and customer deposits as presented on the consolidated statements of cash flows. Prior to adopting Topic 606 on January 1, 2018, we had defined billings in previous filings as revenues recognized plus the change in total deferred revenue as presented on the consolidated statements of cash flows. Our current definition better aligns with Topic 606, which became effective for our interim and annual periods beginning January 1, 2018. Refer to Note 2 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding Topic 606.A calculation of billings is provided below: Year Ended December 31, 2018 2017 2016 *As Adjusted *As Adjusted (dollars in thousands)Billings: Total revenues$2,608,816 $1,918,494 $1,390,985Change in deferred revenue, unbilled receivables and customer deposits(1) 480,019 381,160 283,568Total billings$3,088,835 $2,299,654 $1,674,553Year-over-year percentage change in total billings34% 37% NM*As adjusted to reflect the impact of the full retrospective adoption of Topic 606. See Note 2 for further details.NM - Not meaningful. Year-over-year percentage change in total billings is not meaningful as 2015 billings have not been adjusted for the adoption of Topic 606.(1)As presented on or derived from our consolidated statements of cash flows.Billings consists of amounts invoiced for subscription contracts with existing customers, renewal contracts, contracts for increased purchases with existing customers (expansion contracts), contracts with new customers, and contracts for professional services and training. Factors that may cause our billings results to vary from period to period include the following:•Billings duration. While we typically bill customers annually for our subscription services. Customers sometimes request, and we accommodate, billings with durations less than or greater than the typical 12-month term. •Contract start date. From time to time, we enter into contracts with a contract start date in the future, and we exclude these amounts from billings as these amounts are not included in our consolidated balance sheets, unless such amounts have been paid as of the balance sheet date. •Foreign currency exchange rates. While a majority of our billings have historically been in U.S. Dollars, an increasing percentage of our billings in recent periods has been in foreign currencies, particularly the Euro and British Pound Sterling. •Timing of contract renewals. While customers typically renew their contracts at the end of the contract term, from time to time customers may do so either before or after the scheduled expiration date. For example, in cases where we are successful in selling additional products or services to an existing customer, a customer may decide to renew its existing contract early to ensure that all its contracts expire on the same date. In other cases, prolonged negotiations or other factors may result in a contract not being renewed until after it has expired. 32Table of ContentsWhile we believe billings is a useful leading indicator regarding the performance of our business, due to the factors described above, an increase or decrease in new or renewed subscriptions in a reporting period may not have an immediate impact on billings for that reporting period.To facilitate greater year-over-year comparability in our billings results, we disclose the impact that foreign currency rate fluctuations and fluctuations in billings duration had on our billings. The impact of foreign currency rate fluctuations is calculated by translating the current period results for entities reporting in currencies other than U.S. Dollars into U.S. Dollars at the average exchange rates in effect during the prior period presented, rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the current period. The impact of fluctuations in billings duration is calculated by replacing the portion of multi-year billings in excess of 12 months during the current period with the portion of multi-year billings in excess of 12 months during the prior period presented. Notwithstanding the adjustments described above, the comparability of billings results from period to period remains subject to the impact of variations in the dollar value of contracts with future start dates and the timing of contract renewals, for which no adjustments have been presented.Foreign currency rate fluctuations had a favorable impact of $31.0 million and $9.1 million on billings for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Changes in billings duration had a favorable impact of $7.4 million and $1.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.Free cash flow. We define free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, as GAAP net cash provided by operating activities reduced by purchases of property and equipment. Purchases of property and equipment are otherwise included in cash used in investing activities under GAAP. We believe information regarding free cash flow provides useful information to investors because it is an indicator of the strength and performance of our business operations. However, our calculation of free cash flow may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies. Year Ended December 31, 2018 2017 2016 *As Adjusted *As Adjusted (in thousands)Free cash flow: Net cash provided by operating activities$811,089 $642,940 $159,081Purchases of property and equipment(224,462) (150,510) (105,562)Free cash flow (1)$586,627 $492,430 $53,519*As adjusted to reflect the impact of the full retrospective adoption of Topic 606. See Note 2 for further details.(1)Free cash flow for the year ended December 31, 2018 includes the cash outflow of $145.3 million relating to the repayments of convertible senior notes attributable to debt discount. Free cash flow for the year ended December 31, 2016 includes the cash outflow of a $267.5 million payment for aggregate legal settlements. Refer to Note 11 and 18, respectively in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details.33Table of ContentsAverage contract term. We calculate the average contract term for new customers, expansion contracts and renewals based on the term of those contracts entered into during the period weighted by their ACV. Revised mapping of customers in the current period may result in revised new customer, expansion and renewal contract terms for previous periods, due to adjustments for acquisitions, spin-offs, improved subsidiary mapping, consolidations and updates to customer DUNS numbers. Previously disclosed average contract terms may be restated to reflect such adjustments to allow for comparability. The average new customer contract term was 35 months, 32 months, and 31 months for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. The average expansion contract term was 25 months for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 26 months for each of the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The average renewal contract term was 27 months for each of the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 and 28 months for the year ended December 31, 2016. G2K customer count. The Global 2000 (G2K) customer count is defined as the total number of G2K companies in our customer base as of the end of the period. Our G2K customer count was 883, 810, and 721 as of December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The Forbes Global 2000 is an annual ranking of the top 2,000 public companies in the world by Forbes magazine. The ranking is based on a mix of four metrics: sales, profit, assets, and market value. The Forbes Global 2000 is updated annually in the second quarter of the calendar year. Current and prior period G2K customer counts are based on the most recent list for comparability purposes. We also adjust the G2K count for acquisitions, spin-offs and other market activity. For example, we add a G2K customer when a G2K company that is not our customer acquires a company in our existing customer base that is not a G2K company. When we enter into a contract with a G2K parent company, or any of its related subsidiaries, or any combination of entities within a G2K company, we count only one G2K customer. We do not count further penetration into entities within a given G2K as a new customer in the G2K customer count. Our G2K customer count also excludes customers that have only purchased our Express product offering, which is our entry-level IT service management solution. Our G2K customer count does not include large private companies, government agencies and educational organizations, which represent a growing portion of our customer base. As a result, our G2K customer count metric has become less relevant to our business over time and we do not plan to disclose this metric in future filings. Average ACV per G2K customer. We calculate average ACV for our G2K customers by taking aggregate ACV from G2K customers as of the end of the period divided by the total number of G2K customers as of the end of the period. Our average ACV per G2K customer was approximately $1.7 million, $1.3 million, and $1.1 million as of December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. ACV is calculated based on the foreign exchange rate in effect at the time the contract was entered into, and as a result, foreign currency rate fluctuations could cause variability in the average ACV per G2K customer. Prior G2K customer counts used in calculating ACV per G2K customer are adjusted for the most recent Forbes Global 2000 list for comparability purposes. As discussed above, average ACV per G2K customer has become less relevant to our business over time as the underlying G2K customer count does not include large private companies, government agencies and education organizations, which represent a growing portion of our customer base. As a result, we do not plan to disclose this metric in future filings.Components of Results of Operations RevenuesSubscription revenues. Subscription revenues are primarily comprised of fees that give customers access to the ordered subscription service for both self-hosted offerings and cloud-based subscription offerings, and related support and updates, if any, to the subscription service during the subscription term. For our cloud-based offerings, we recognize revenue ratably over the subscription term. For self-hosted offerings, a substantial portion of the sales price is recognized upon delivery of the software, which may cause greater variability in our subscription revenues and subscription gross margin. Pricing includes multiple instances, hosting and support services, data backup and disaster recovery services, as well as future updates, when and if available, offered during the subscription term. We typically invoice our customers for subscription fees in annual increments upon execution of the initial contract or subsequent renewal. Our contracts are generally non-cancelable during the subscription term, though a customer can terminate for breach if we materially fail to perform. Professional services and other revenues. Professional services revenues consist of fees associated with professional services. Our arrangements for professional services are primarily on a time-and-materials basis. We generally invoice our professional services monthly in arrears based on actual hours and expenses incurred, and revenues are recognized as services are delivered. Some of our professional services arrangements are on a fixed fee or subscription basis, under which we recognize revenues on a proportional performance basis or ratably over the contract term. Other revenues primarily consist of fees from customer training delivered on-site or through publicly available classes. Typical payment terms require our customers to pay us within 30 days of invoice. 34Table of ContentsWe generate sales directly through our sales team and, to a lesser extent, indirectly through resale partners. We also offer a portfolio of professional and other services, both directly and through our network of partners. Revenues from our direct sales organization represented 84% for the year ended December 31, 2018, and 88% for each of the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. For purposes of this disclosure, revenues from systems integrators and managed services providers are included as revenues from our direct sales organization. Allocation of Overhead CostsOverhead costs associated with office facilities, IT and certain depreciation related to infrastructure that is not dedicated for customer use or research and development use are allocated to cost of revenues and operating expenses based on headcount. Cost of RevenuesCost of subscription revenues. Cost of subscription revenues consists primarily of expenses related to hosting our services and providing support to our customers. These expenses are comprised of data center capacity costs, which include colocation costs associated with our data centers as well as interconnectivity between data centers, depreciation related to our infrastructure hardware equipment dedicated for customer use, amortization of intangible assets, expenses associated with software, IT services and support dedicated for customer use, personnel-related costs directly associated with data center operations and customer support, including salaries, benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation, and allocated overhead.Cost of professional services and other revenues. Cost of professional services and other revenues consists primarily of personnel-related costs directly associated with our professional services and training departments, including salaries, benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation, the costs of contracted third-party partners, travel expenses and allocated overhead.Professional services are performed directly by our services team, as well as by contracted third-party partners. Fees paid by us to third-party partners are primarily recognized as cost of revenues as the professional services are delivered. Cost of revenues associated with our professional services engagements contracted with third-party partners as a percentage of professional services and other revenues was 18%, 22% and 21% for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.Sales and MarketingSales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel-related expenses directly associated with our sales and marketing staff, including salaries, benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation. Sales and marketing expenses also include the amortization of commissions paid to our sales employees and third-party referral fees, including related payroll taxes and fringe benefits. From time to time, third parties provide us referrals for which we pay a referral fee. We include revenues associated with these referrals as part of revenues from our direct sales organization. Referral fees paid to these third parties are generally 10% of the customer’s net new ACV. We defer referral fees paid as they are considered incremental selling costs associated with acquiring customer contracts, and include the amortization of these referral fees in sales and marketing expense. In addition, sales and marketing expenses include expenses offset by proceeds related to our annual Knowledge user conference (Knowledge), other marketing program expenses, which include events other than Knowledge, and costs associated with purchasing advertising and marketing data, software and subscription services dedicated for sales and marketing use and allocated overhead. As part of our adoption of Topic 606, during the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded a decrease in sales and marketing expenses and a corresponding increase to our deferred commissions asset of $5.4 million. These adjustments reflect the correction of previously undercapitalized incremental fringe benefit costs associated with sales commissions that were paid since 2012. We concluded that these adjustments were not material to the current period or any previously reported periods presented, as adjusted for the full retrospective adoption of Topic 606.Research and DevelopmentResearch and development expenses consist primarily of personnel-related expenses directly associated with our research and development staff, including salaries, benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation and allocated overhead. Research and development expenses also include data center capacity costs, costs associated with outside services contracted for research and development purposes, amortization of intangible assets and depreciation of infrastructure hardware equipment that is used solely for research and development purposes. 35Table of ContentsGeneral and AdministrativeGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel-related expenses for our executive, finance, legal, human resources, facilities and administrative personnel, including salaries, benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation, external legal, accounting and other professional services fees, other corporate expenses, amortization of intangible assets and allocated overhead.Legal SettlementsLegal settlements consist of one-time aggregate charges related to the settlement agreements with Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (HPE) and BMC Software, Inc. (BMC) in 2016. Refer to Note 18 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details regarding these matters.Provision for Income TaxesProvision for income taxes consists of federal, state and foreign income taxes. Due to cumulative losses, we maintain a valuation allowance against our U.S. and certain foreign deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2018 and 2017. We consider all available evidence, both positive and negative, including but not limited to earnings history, projected future outcomes, industry and market trends and the nature of each of the deferred tax assets in assessing the extent to which a valuation allowance should be applied against our U.S. and foreign deferred tax assets.36Table of ContentsResults of Operations The following tables set forth our results of operations for the periods presented.

See Note 2 for further details. Subscription revenues increased $681.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the prior year, driven by increased purchases by existing customers and an increase in customer count. Included in subscription revenues is $118.5 million and $80.2 million of revenues recognized upfront from the delivery of software associated with self-hosted offerings during the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. We expect subscription revenues to grow in absolute dollars as we continue to add new customers and existing customers increase their usage of our products, but remain relatively flat as a percentage of total revenues in the year ending December 31, 2019. Our expectations for revenues, cost of revenues and operating expenses for the year ending December 31, 2019 are based on foreign exchange rates as of December 31, 2018.Subscription revenues consist of the following: Year Ended December 31, % Change 2018 2017 *As Adjusted (dollars in thousands) Service management products$2,050,841 $1,526,125 34%ITOM products370,472 213,375 74%Total subscription revenues$2,421,313 $1,739,500 39%*As adjusted to reflect the impact of the full retrospective adoption of Topic 606.

Our ITOM products are generally priced on a per node basis.Professional services and other revenues increased $8.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the prior year, due to an increase in the services provided to new and existing customers. We expect professional services and other revenues for the year ending December 31, 2019 to increase in absolute dollar terms, but remain relatively flat as a percentage of total revenues when compared to professional services and other revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018 as we are increasingly focused on deploying our internal professional services organization as a strategic resource and relying on our partner ecosystem to contract directly with customers for service delivery. 39Table of ContentsCost of Revenues and Gross Profit Percentage Year Ended December 31, % Change 2018 2017 *As Adjusted (dollars in thousands) Cost of revenues: Subscription$417,421 $315,570 32%Professional services and other205,237 184,292 11%Total cost of revenues$622,658 $499,862 25%Gross profit percentage: Subscription83% 82% Professional services and other(9%) (3%) Total gross profit percentage76% 74% Gross profit:$1,986,158 $1,418,632 40%Headcount (at period end) Subscription1,171 936 25%Professional services and other664 562 18%Total headcount1,835 1,498 22%*As adjusted to reflect the impact of the full retrospective adoption of Topic 606. See Note 2 for further details. Cost of subscription revenues increased $101.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the prior year, primarily due to increased headcount resulting in an increase of $31.4 million in personnel-related costs excluding stock-based compensation, an increase of $13.4 million in stock-based compensation and an increase of $9.2 million in other overhead expenses. Depreciation expense increased $22.7 million due to purchases of infrastructure hardware equipment for our data centers and expenses associated with software and IT services and technical support increased $10.3 million. In addition, data center capacity costs increased $6.3 million due to the addition of new data centers and the expansion of existing data centers, amortization of intangibles increased $4.1 million as a result of acquisitions and outside service costs increased $3.1 million due to an increase in contractors to support our customer contracts. Our subscription gross profit percentage increased to 83% for the year ended December 31, 2018, from 82% for the year ended December 31, 2017, due to improved data center utilization and economies of scale. The increase in revenues recognized upfront from the delivery of software associated with self-hosted offerings contributed to approximately one percentage point improvement in our subscription gross profit percentage for each of the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. We expect our cost of subscription revenues to increase in absolute dollar terms as we provide subscription services to more customers and increase usage within our customer instances, but we expect such increase to be at a slower rate than the increase in our subscription revenues, leading to a slight increase in our subscription gross profit percentage for the year ending December 31, 2019 as we continue to leverage the investments we have made in our existing data center infrastructure. To the extent future acquisitions are consummated, our cost of subscription revenues may increase due to additional non-cash charges associated with the amortization of intangible assets acquired. Cost of professional services and other revenues increased $20.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the prior year, primarily due to increased headcount resulting in an increase of $17.3 million in personnel-related costs excluding stock-based compensation, an increase of $5.4 million in stock-based compensation and an increase of $3.0 million in overhead expenses, partially offset by a decrease in outside service costs of $4.4 million, primarily due to a decrease in professional services performed by contracted third-party partners.Our professional services and other gross loss percentage increased to 9% during the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to 3% in the prior year, primarily due to stock-based compensation and other personnel-related costs increasing at a higher rate than professional services and other revenues as we invest in specialized resources to support our newer products. 40Table of ContentsSales and Marketing Year Ended December 31 % Change 2018 2017 *As Adjusted (dollars in thousands) Sales and marketing$1,203,056 $894,977 34%Percentage of revenues46% 46% Headcount (at period end)3,061 2,413 27%*As adjusted to reflect the impact of the full retrospective adoption of Topic 606.

Sales and marketing expenses increased $308.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the prior year, primarily due to increased headcount resulting in an increase of $115.5 million in personnel-related costs excluding stock-based compensation and commissions, an increase of $57.5 million in stock-based compensation and an increase of $27.6 million in overhead expenses. Expenses associated with commissions and third-party referral fees increased $46.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the prior year, due to an increase in contracts with new customers, expansion and renewal contracts. Amortization expenses associated with commissions and third-party referral fees, including as applicable their related payroll taxes and fringe benefits, amounted to 6% of subscription revenues for each of the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. Outside services costs increased $10.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the prior year, primarily due to an increase in contractors and professional fees to support our sales and marketing functions. Marketing program expenses, which include events other than Knowledge, and costs associated with purchasing advertising and market data, increased $36.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the prior year. Expenses related to Knowledge, net of proceeds increased $6.8 million due to a 21% year-over-year increase in registrations. Loss from write-off of property and equipment increased $4.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the prior year primarily due to write off of internal-use software. We expect sales and marketing expenses to increase in absolute dollar terms for the year ending December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, as we continue to expand our direct sales force, increase our marketing activities, grow our international operations and build brand awareness, but decrease as a percentage of total revenues.

Research and development expenses also increased $4.0 million due to an increase in data center capacity costs and depreciation of infrastructure hardware equipment that is used solely for research and development purposes and $1.4 million as a result of additional expense related to software and IT services and technical support for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the prior year. We expect research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollar terms for the year ending December 31, 2019, as we continue to improve the existing functionality of our services, develop new applications to fill market needs and enhance our core platform, but remain relatively flat as a percentage of total revenues.41Table of ContentsGeneral and Administrative Year Ended December 31 % Change 2018 2017 (dollars in thousands) General and administrative$296,027 $210,533 41%Percentage of revenues12% 11% Headcount (at period end)1,178 892 32%General and administrative expenses increased $85.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the prior year, primarily due to increased headcount, which resulted in an increase of $42.7 million in personnel-related costs excluding stock-based compensation and an increase of $30.4 million in stock-based compensation. Outside services costs increased $7.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the prior year, primarily due to an increase in contractors and professional fees to support our administrative function. Amortization of intangibles increased $2.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the prior year, as a result of acquisitions.We expect general and administrative expenses to increase in absolute dollar terms for the year ending December 31, 2019 as we continue to hire new employees, but remain flat as a percentage of total revenues.

See Note 2 for further details.Stock-based compensation expense increased $149.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the prior year, primarily due to additional grants to current and new employees and increased weighted-average grant date fair value of stock awards. Stock-based compensation expense is inherently difficult to forecast due to fluctuations in our stock price. Based upon our stock price as of December 31, 2018, we expect stock-based compensation expense to continue to increase in absolute dollar terms for the year ending December 31, 2019 as we continue to issue stock-based awards to our employees, but decrease as a percentage of total revenues. Foreign Currency ExchangeOur international operations have provided and will continue to provide a significant portion of our total revenues. Revenues outside North America represented 34% and 33% of total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Because we primarily transact in foreign currencies for sales outside of the United States, the general weakening of the U.S. Dollar relative to other major foreign currencies (primarily the Euro and British Pound Sterling) from the year ended December 31, 2017 to the year ended December 31, 2018 had a favorable impact on our revenues. For entities reporting in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar, if we had translated our results for the year ended December 31, 2018 at the average exchange rates in effect for the year ended December 31, 2017 rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the period, our reported subscription revenues would have been $27.5 million lower and our reported professional services and other revenues would have been $2.2 million lower. 42Table of ContentsIn addition, because we primarily transact in foreign currencies for cost of sales and operating expenses outside of the United States, the general weakening of the U.S. Dollar relative to other major foreign currencies from the year ended December 31, 2017 to the year ended December 31, 2018 had an unfavorable impact on our cost of sales and operating expenses. For entities reporting in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar, if we had translated our results for the year ended December 31, 2018 at the average exchange rates in effect for the year ended December 31, 2017 rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the period, our reported sales and marketing expenses would have been $4.6 million lower. The impact from the foreign currency movements from the year ended December 31, 2017 to the year ended December 31, 2018 is not material to cost of revenues, research and development expenses and general and administrative expenses.Interest Expense Year Ended December 31 % Change 2018 2017 (dollars in thousands) Interest expense$(52,733) $(53,394) (1%)Percentage of revenues(2%) (3%) Interest expense decreased $0.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the prior year, due to the early conversions and maturity of the 2018 Notes, offset by the increase in the aggregate amount of convertible debt and associated amortization expense of debt discount and issuance costs related to the 2022 Notes. For the year ending December 31, 2019, we expect to incur approximately $33.3 million in amortization expense of debt discount and issuance costs related to the 2022 Notes.

Interest income and other income (expense), net increased $51.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the prior year, primarily due to $19.3 million of realized gains relating to changes in the market value of our marketable equity securities. Refer to Note 2 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details. Interest income and other income (expense), net also increased $19.2 million due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, net of the effect of our foreign currency derivative contracts and interest income increased $17.5 million due to higher cash and investment balances and higher yields on our invested balances during the year ended December 31, 2018, partially offset by a $4.1 million loss recorded on early note conversions.In order to manage certain exposures to currency fluctuations, we initiated a limited hedging program during the year ended December 31, 2018 by entering into foreign currency derivative contracts with maturities of 12 months or less to hedge a portion of our net outstanding monetary assets and liabilities. These hedging contracts may reduce, but cannot entirely eliminate, the impact of adverse currency exchange rate movements. 43Table of Contents Provision for (Benefit from) Income Taxes Year Ended December 31 % Change 2018 2017 *As Adjusted (dollars in thousands) Loss before income taxes$(39,024) $(113,406) (66%)Provision for (benefit from) income taxes(12,320) 3,440 NMEffective tax rate32% (3%) *As adjusted to reflect the impact of the full retrospective adoption of Topic 606. See Note 2 for further details.NM - Not meaningful.Our effective tax rate was 32% for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to (3%) for the prior year ended December 31, 2017. We had a benefit from income taxes of $12.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to a provision for income taxes of $3.4 million for the prior year, primarily due to the one-time indirect tax benefit of Topic 606 on income taxes associated with intercompany adjustments offset by the increase in current cash taxes payable in foreign jurisdictions. See Note 17 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for our reconciliation of income taxes at the statutory federal rate to the provision for income taxes.We continue to maintain a full valuation allowance on our U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets and certain foreign deferred tax assets, and the significant components of the tax expense recorded are current cash taxes payable in various jurisdictions. The cash tax expenses are impacted by each jurisdiction’s individual tax rates, laws on timing of recognition of income and deductions, and availability of net operating losses and tax credits. Given the full valuation allowance, sensitivity of current cash taxes to local rules and our foreign structuring, we expect that our effective tax rate could fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis and could be adversely affected to the extent earnings are lower than anticipated in countries that have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher statutory rates. To the extent sufficient positive evidence becomes available, we may release all or a portion of our valuation allowance in one or more future periods. A release of the valuation allowance, if any, would result in the recognition of certain deferred tax assets and a material income tax benefit for the period in which such release is recorded.

Foreign Currency ExchangeOur international operations have provided and will continue to provide a significant portion of our total revenues. Revenues outside North America represented 33% and 32% of total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Because we primarily transact in foreign currencies for sales outside of the United States, the general weakening of the U.S. Dollar relative to other major foreign currencies (primarily the Euro and British Pound Sterling) from the year ended December 31, 2016 to the year ended December 31, 2017 had a favorable impact on our revenues. For entities reporting in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar, if we had translated our results for the year ended December 31, 2017 at the average exchange rates in effect for the year ended December 31, 2016 rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the period, our reported subscription revenues would have been $5.3 million lower.

See Note 2 for further details.51Table of ContentsSeasonality, Cyclicality and Quarterly TrendsWe have historically experienced seasonality in terms of when we enter into customer agreements for our services. We sign a significantly higher percentage of agreements with new customers, as well as renewal agreements with existing customers, in the quarter ended December 31. The increase in customer agreements for the quarter ended December 31 is primarily a result of the terms of our commission plans, which incentivize our direct sales force to meet their annual quotas by December 31, and large enterprise account buying patterns typical in the software industry, which are driven primarily by the expiration of annual authorized budgeted expenditures. In addition, the number of agreements entered into with the U.S. federal government has historically been higher in the third quarter of each year, driven primarily by timing of annual budget expenditures. Furthermore, we usually sign a significant portion of these agreements during the last month, and often the last two weeks, of each quarter. This seasonality in the timing of entering into customer contracts is sometimes not immediately apparent in our billings due to the fact that we typically exclude cloud-offering contracts with a future start date from our billings. Similarly, this seasonality is reflected to a much lesser extent, and sometimes is not immediately apparent in our revenues, due to the fact that we recognize subscription revenues from our cloud offering contracts over the term of the subscription agreement, which is generally 12 to 36 months. Although these seasonal factors are common in the technology industry, historical patterns should not be considered a reliable indicator of our future sales activity or performance. Our revenues have increased over the periods presented due to increased sales to new and existing customers. Our operating expenses have increased over the periods presented primarily due to increases in headcount, data center operations and other related expenses to support our growth. We have historically seen an increase in marketing expenses in the quarter ended June 30, and a corresponding decrease in marketing expenses in the quarter ended September 30 due to the expenses incurred for our annual Knowledge user conference, partially offset by related proceeds. Marketing expenses in the quarter ended December 31 are also historically higher due to user forums we conduct in that quarter. We anticipate operating expenses will continue to increase in future periods as we continue to focus on investing in the long-term growth of our business.Our free cash flow is impacted by the timing of collections and disbursements, including the timing of capital expenditures. We have historically seen higher collections in the quarter ended March 31 due to seasonality in timing of entering into customer contracts as described above. We have historically seen higher disbursements in the quarter ended March 31, primarily due to payouts under the preceding year’s annual commission plans and purchases under our employee stock purchase plan, and expect to continue to see higher disbursements in the quarter ended March 31 as we start our 401(k) match program in the quarter ending March 31, 2019.Liquidity and Capital Resources Our principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents, investments, and cash generated from operations. As of December 31, 2018, we had $1.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, of which $253.9 million represented cash held by foreign subsidiaries. $249.9 million of the $1.5 billion is denominated in currencies other than U.S. Dollar. In addition, we had $581.9 million in long-term investments that provide additional capital resources. We do not anticipate that we will need funds generated from foreign operations to fund our domestic operations.Prior to the enactment of the Tax Act, we considered earnings from foreign operations to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the United States. Subsequent to the enactment of the Tax Act, we determined that the unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries will no longer be considered indefinitely reinvested, except in certain designated jurisdictions in which the resident entity is a service provider which is not expected to generate substantial amounts of cash in excess of what may be reinvested by the local entity. In May and June 2017, we issued the 2022 Notes with an aggregate principal amount of $782.5 million. In connection with the issuance of the 2022 Notes, we entered into the 2022 Note Hedge transactions and 2022 Warrant transactions with certain financial institutions. The price of our common stock was greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price of the 2022 Notes for at least 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the quarters ended June 30, 2018 and September 30, 2018. Therefore, the 2022 Notes were convertible at the holders’ option beginning on July 1, 2018 through December 31, 2018. The 2022 Notes are not convertible at the holders’ option for the quarter ending March 31, 2019. The impact of the 2022 Notes on our liquidity will depend on the settlement method we elect. We currently intend to settle the principal amount of any converted 2022 Notes in cash. We have not received any conversion requests for our 2022 Notes.52Table of ContentsIn November 2013, we issued the 2018 Notes with an aggregate principal amount of $575.0 million. We settled $413.2 million principal amount of the 2018 Notes in early conversions and the remaining principal amount was settled on November 1, 2018, the maturity date of our 2018 Notes. The conversion value over the principal amount for the early 2018 Note conversions was settled in cash from the exercise of the 2018 Note Hedges. The conversion value over the principal amount for the principal amount settled on November 1, 2018 was satisfied with approximately 1.3 million shares of our common stock, which was entirely offset by shares of our common stock delivered to us by the 2018 Note Hedge counterparties under the 2018 Note Hedge, and cash in lieu of fractional shares. The shares delivered to us by the 2018 Note Hedge counterparties were immediately retired. As a result of the early note conversions, we recorded a loss of $4.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. As a result of the settlement of the 2018 Notes and the 2018 Note Hedges, we recorded an aggregate $6.4 million net reduction to additional paid-in capital, reflecting $773.3 million of fair value adjustments to the conversion option settled, offset by a $766.9 million benefit from the exercise of the 2018 Note Hedges. The 2018 Notes and 2018 Note Hedge are no longer outstanding, and the portion of the 2018 Warrants that have not yet been automatically exercised remain outstanding as of the date of this filing. We have issued and expect to continue to issue additional shares of our common stock in the first half of 2019 upon the automatic exercise of the 2018 Warrants. Additionally, we expect to issue additional shares of our common stock in the second half of 2022 upon the automatic exercise of the 2022 Warrants. As the 2018 Warrants and the 2022 Warrants will be net share settled, the total number of shares of our common stock we will issue depends on the daily volume-weighted average stock prices over a 60 trading day period beginning on the first expiration date of the 2018 Warrants, which was February 1, 2019, and the first expiration date of the 2022 Warrants, which will be September 1, 2022. Because exercises of the 2018 Warrants and the 2022 Warrants will be net share settled, there will not be an impact on our liquidity. Refer to Note 11 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. We anticipate our current cash and cash equivalents balance and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs, including the repayment of our 2022 Notes, expansion of data centers, lease obligations, expenditures related to the growth of our headcount and the acquisition of fixed assets, intangibles, and investments in office facilities, to accommodate our growth for at least the next 12 months. Whether these resources are adequate to meet our liquidity needs beyond that period will depend on our growth, operating results, cash utilized for acquisitions and/or debt retirements if any are consummated, and the capital expenditures required to meet possible increased demand for our services. If we require additional capital resources to grow our business at any time in the future, we may seek to finance our operations from the current funds available or seek additional equity or debt financing.

The increase in operating cash flow was primarily due to a decrease in net loss of $90.1 million. The remaining change was due to an increase in non-cash adjustments to reconcile net loss to net cash provided by operations and the favorable impact on operating cash flow from changes in operating assets and liabilities. 53Table of ContentsNet cash provided by operating activities was $642.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $159.1 million for the prior year. The increase in operating cash flow was primarily due to $267.5 million cash paid for aggregate legal settlements during the year ended December 31, 2016 (refer to Note 18 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details). The remaining change was due to an increase in non-cash adjustments to reconcile net loss to net cash provided by operations and the favorable impact on operating cash flow from changes in operating assets and liabilities. Investing ActivitiesNet cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $347.4 million compared to $883.9 million for the prior year. The decrease in cash used in investing activities was mainly due to a $612.5 million decrease in net purchases of investments and a $20.8 million decrease in business combinations, net of cash and restricted cash acquired. The decrease in cash used in investing activities was partially offset by a $74.0 million increase in capital expenditures related to the purchases of infrastructure hardware equipment to support the expansion of our data centers as well as investments in leasehold improvements, furniture and equipment to support our headcount growth, an $17.7 million increase in purchases of other intangibles and a $5.1 million increase in purchases of strategic investments.Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $883.9 million compared to $108.2 million for the prior year. The increase in cash used in investing activities was mainly due to a $714.7 million increase in net purchases of investments, a $44.9 million increase in capital expenditures related to the purchases of infrastructure hardware equipment to support the expansion of our data centers as well as investments in leasehold improvements, furniture and equipment to support our headcount growth, a $23.9 million increase in business combinations, net of cash and restricted cash acquired, and a $4.3 million increase in purchases of strategic investments. The increase in cash used in investing activities was partially offset by a $12.1 million decrease in purchases of other intangibles. Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $607.4 million compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $538.9 million for the prior year. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we had $698.2 million in net proceeds from issuance of the 2022 Notes and the related 2022 Note Hedge and 2022 Warrant transactions, and used $55.0 million in cash to repurchase shares of our common stock. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we had additional financing cash outflows of $429.6 million relating to the repayments of the 2018 Notes attributable to principal and $99.1 million increase in taxes paid related to net share settlement of equity awards, partially offset by a $21.6 million increase in proceeds from employee equity plans.Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $538.9 million compared to net cash used in financing activities of $55.8 million for the prior year. The change was primarily due to a $698.2 million increase in net proceeds from issuance of the 2022 Notes and the 2022 Note Hedge and 2022 Warrant transactions entered into during the year ended December 31, 2017 and a $16.2 million increase in proceeds from employee stock plans, partially offset by a $62.0 million increase in taxes paid related to net share settlement of equity awards and a $55.0 million increase in cash used to repurchase shares of our common stock.54Table of ContentsContractual Obligations and CommitmentsThe following table represents our future non-cancelable contractual obligations as of December 31, 2018, aggregated by type: Payments Due by Period Total LessThan1 Year 1 – 3Years 3 – 5Years MoreThan5 Years (in thousands)Operating leases (1)$898,851 $55,435 $124,344 $140,198 $578,874Purchase obligations (2)140,377 55,875 73,402 8,469 2,631Principal amount payable on our convertible senior notes (3)782,500 — — 782,500 —Other3,743 813 1,708 1,222 —Total contractual obligations$1,825,471 $112,123 $199,454 $932,389 $581,505(1)Consists of future non-cancelable minimum rental payments under operating leases for some of our offices and data centers.(2)Consists of future minimum payments under non-cancelable purchase commitments related to our daily business operations. Not included in the table above are certain purchase commitments related to our future annual Knowledge user conferences and other customer or sales conferences to be held in 2020 and future years. If we were to cancel these contractual commitments as of December 31, 2018, we would have been obligated to pay cancellation penalties of approximately $18.5 million in aggregate.(3)For additional information regarding our convertible senior notes, refer to Note 11 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.In addition to the obligations in the table above, $4.7 million of unrecognized tax benefits have been recorded as liabilities as of December 31, 2018. It is uncertain as to if or when such amounts may be settled. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements During all periods presented, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. As such, we are not exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in those types of relationships.Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and EstimatesOur management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. These items are monitored and analyzed by us for changes in facts and circumstances, and material changes in these estimates could occur in the future. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Changes in estimates are reflected in reported results for the period in which they become known. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions and such differences could be material.While our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe that the following accounting policies are critical to the process of making significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our audited consolidated financial statements.Revenue RecognitionWe report our revenues in two categories: (i) subscriptions and (ii) professional services and other. Revenues are recognized when control of these services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those services. 55Table of ContentsWe determine revenue recognition through the following steps:•Identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer;•Identification of the performance obligations in the contract;•Determination of the transaction price;•Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and•Recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation.Subscription revenuesSubscription revenues are primarily comprised of subscription fees that give customers access to the ordered subscription service, related support and updates, if any, to the subscribed service during the subscription term. For our cloud services, we recognize subscription revenues ratably over the contract term beginning on the commencement date of each contract, the date we make our services available to our customers. Our contracts with customers typically include a fixed amount of consideration and are generally non-cancelable and without any refund-type provisions. We typically invoice our customers annually in advance for our subscription services upon execution of the initial contract or subsequent renewal, and our invoices are typically due within 30 days from the invoice date.Subscription revenues also include revenues from self-hosted offerings in which customers deploy, or we grant customers the option to deploy without significant penalty, our subscription service internally or contract with a third party to host the software. For these contracts, we account for the software element and the related support and updates separately as they are distinct performance obligations (refer to the discussion below related to contracts with multiple performance obligations for further details). The transaction price is allocated to separate performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price (SSP) basis. Transaction price allocated to the software element is recognized upon delivery, which is when transfer of control of the software to the customer is complete. The transaction price allocated to the related support and updates are recognized ratably over the contract term. Professional services and other revenuesOur professional services arrangements are primarily on a time-and-materials basis, and revenues on these arrangements are recognized as the services are delivered. We typically invoice our customers monthly in arrears for these professional services based on actual hours and expenses incurred, and our invoices are typically due within 30 days from the invoice date. Some of our professional services arrangements are on a fixed fee or subscription basis, under which we recognize revenues on a proportional performance basis or ratably over the contract term. In instances where certain milestones are required to be met before revenues are recognized, we defer professional services revenues and the associated costs until milestone criteria have been met. Other revenues consist of fees from customer training delivered on-site or through publicly available classes.Contracts with multiple performance obligationsWe enter into contracts that can include various combinations of products and services, which are generally capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations. For these contracts, the transaction price is allocated to the separate performance obligations on a relative SSP basis. Evaluating the terms and conditions included within our customer contracts to ensure appropriate revenue recognition and determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment. Significant judgment is also involved in determining SSP by considering the historical selling price of these performance obligations in similar transactions as well as other factors, including, but not limited to, competitive pricing of similar products, other software vendor pricing, industry publications and current pricing practices.56Table of ContentsDeferred CommissionsDeferred commissions are the incremental selling costs that are associated with acquiring customer contracts and consist primarily of sales commissions paid to our sales force and referral fees paid to independent third-parties. Capitalized sales commissions also include the associated payroll taxes and fringe benefit costs associated with payments to our sales employees to the extent they are incremental. Commissions and referral fees earned upon the execution of initial and expansion contracts are primarily deferred and amortized over a period of benefit that we have determined to be five years. Commissions earned upon the renewal of customer contracts are deferred and amortized over the average renewal term. Additionally, for self-hosted offerings, consistent with the recognition of subscription revenues for self-hosted offerings, a portion of the commission cost is expensed upfront when the self-hosted offering is made available. The determination of the period of benefit requires significant judgment by taking into consideration our customer contracts, our technology life cycle and other factors. We include amortization of deferred commissions in sales and marketing expense in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). Business combinationsThe allocation of the purchase price requires us to make significant estimates in determining the fair value of acquired assets and assumed liabilities, especially with respect to intangible assets. These estimates are based upon a number of factors, including historical experience, market conditions and information obtained from the management of the acquired company. Critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets included, but are not limited to, cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future, discount rates, the time and expense that would be necessary to recreate the assets and the profit margin a market participant would receive. These estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates.Goodwill, Intangible Assets and Other Long Lived AssetsGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price in a business combination over the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired. We evaluate and test the recoverability of goodwill in our single reporting unit for impairment at least annually during our fourth quarter or more frequently if circumstances indicate that goodwill may not be recoverable. We periodically review the carrying amounts of long-lived assets, such as property and equipment and purchased intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. We have not recognized any impairment charges related to goodwill and long-lived assets during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 because the aggregate fair value of our Company has consistently and materially exceeded the carrying value of our single reporting unit and asset group.Screening for and assessing whether impairment indicators exist or if events or changes in circumstances have occurred, including market conditions, operating fundamentals, competition and general economic conditions, requires significant judgment. Additionally, changes in the technology industry occur frequently and quickly. To the extent an impairment indicator exists, the measurement of the impairment charge requires significant judgment, and could result in a material charge to operating expenses. Stock-based Compensation We recognize compensation expense related to stock options and restricted stock units (RSUs) with only a service condition on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting term of four years. For RSUs granted with both service condition and a performance condition, the expenses are recognized on a graded vesting basis over the requisite service period of generally three years, after assessing the probability of achieving requisite performance criteria. This has the impact of greater stock-based compensation expense during the initial years of the vesting period as stock-based compensation cost is recognized over the requisite service period for each separately vesting tranche of the award as though the award were, in substance, multiple awards. We recognize compensation expense related to shares issued pursuant to the employee stock purchase plan (ESPP) on a straight-line basis over the six-month offering period. We estimate the fair value of options using the Black-Scholes options pricing model and fair value of RSU awards using the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant. We recognize compensation expense net of estimated forfeiture activity, which is based on historical forfeiture rates. We evaluate the forfeiture rates at least annually or when events or circumstances indicate a change may be needed. This may cause a fluctuation in our stock-based compensation in the period of change.57Table of ContentsIncome Taxes We use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes, in which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. We measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be reversed. We recognize the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates as income and expense in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is established if it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. In determining the need for a valuation allowance, we consider future growth, forecasted earnings, future taxable income, the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate, historical earnings, taxable income in prior years, if carryback is permitted under the law, carryforward periods and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. Due to cumulative losses over recent years and based on all available positive and negative evidence, we have determined that it is more likely than not that our U.S. and certain foreign deferred tax assets will not be realizable as of December 31, 2018. To the extent sufficient positive evidence becomes available, we may release a portion, or all, of our valuation allowance in one or more future periods. A release of the valuation allowance, if any, would result in the recognition of certain deferred tax assets and a material income tax benefit for the period in which such release is recorded. Our tax positions are subject to income tax audits by multiple tax jurisdictions throughout the world. We recognize the tax benefit of an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not the position is sustainable upon examination by the taxing authority, based on the technical merits. We measure the tax benefit recognized as the largest amount of benefit which is more likely than not to be realized upon settlement with the taxing authority. We recognize interest accrued and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in our tax provision. Significant judgment is required to evaluate uncertain tax positions. Our evaluations are based upon a number of factors, including changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law or guidance, correspondence with tax authorities during the course of audits and effective settlement of audit issues. Changes in the recognition or measurement of uncertain tax positions could result in material increases or decreases in our income tax expense in the period in which we make the change, which could have a material impact on our effective tax rate and operating results.We calculate the current and deferred income tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed in subsequent years and record adjustments based on filed income tax returns when identified. The amount of income taxes paid is subject to examination by U.S. federal, state and foreign tax authorities. The estimate of the potential outcome of any uncertain tax issue is subject to management’s assessment of relevant risks, facts and circumstances existing at that time. To the extent the assessment of such tax position changes, we record the change in estimate in the period in which we make the determination.New Accounting Pronouncements Pending AdoptionThe impact of recently issued accounting standards is set forth in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.ITEM 7A.QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKForeign Currency Exchange RiskWe have foreign currency risks related to our revenue and operating expenses denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar, primarily the Euro and British Pound Sterling. We are a net receiver of Euro and British Pound Sterling, and therefore benefit from a weakening of the U.S. Dollar relative to these currencies and, conversely, are adversely affected by a strengthening of the U.S. Dollar relative to these currencies. Revenues denominated in U.S. Dollar as a percentage of total revenues was 71% during the year ended December 31, 2018 and 73% during each of the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. In order to manage certain exposures to currency fluctuations, we initiated a limited hedging program during the year ended December 31, 2018 by entering into foreign currency derivative contracts to hedge a portion of our net outstanding monetary assets and liabilities. These derivative contracts are intended to offset gains or losses related to remeasuring monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entities in which they are recorded.A hypothetical 10% increase in the U.S. Dollar against other currencies would have resulted in an increase in operating loss of approximately $23.4 million, $15.3 million and $8.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. This analysis disregards the possibilities that rates can move in opposite directions and that losses from one geographic area may be offset by gains from another geographic area.58Table of ContentsThese derivative contracts expose us to credit risk to the extent that the counterparties may be unable to meet the terms of the arrangement. We mitigate this credit risk by transacting with major financial institutions with high credit ratings and entering into master netting arrangements, which permit net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty. While the contract or notional amount is often used to express the volume of foreign currency derivative contracts, the amounts potentially subject to credit risk are generally limited to the amounts, if any, by which the counterparties’ obligations under the agreements exceed our obligations to the counterparties. We are not required to pledge, and are not entitled to receive, cash collateral related to these derivative instruments. We do not enter into derivative contracts for trading or speculative purposes. Refer to Note 8 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. Interest Rate Sensitivity We had an aggregate of $2.1 billion in cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and long-term investments as of December 31, 2018. This amount was invested primarily in money market funds, certificates of deposit, corporate notes and bonds, government and agency securities and other debt securities with a minimum rating of BBB by Standard & Poor’s, Baa2 by Moody’s, or BBB by Fitch. The primary objectives of our investment activities are the preservation of capital and support of our liquidity requirements. Our investments are exposed to market risk due to fluctuations in interest rates, which may affect our interest income and the fair market value of our investments. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would have resulted in an approximate $9.2 million decline of the fair value of our $2.1 billion of available-for-sale securities. This estimate is based on a sensitivity model that measures market value changes when changes in interest rates occur.As of December 31, 2017, we had an aggregate of $2.2 billion in cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and long-term investments, and a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would have resulted in an approximate $10.7 million decline of the fair value of our available-for-sale securities. Market RiskIn May and June 2017, we issued the 2022 Notes with an aggregate principal amount of $782.5 million. We carry these instruments at face value less unamortized discount on our consolidated balance sheet. Because these instruments do not bear interest, we have no economic interest rate exposure on our 2022 Notes associated with changes in interest rates. However, the fair value of our 2022 Notes is exposed to interest rate risks. Generally, the fair market value of our 2022 Notes will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. In addition, the fair value of the Notes is affected by our stock price due to the conversion feature, and will generally increase as the stock price increases.We hold cash balances with multiple financial institutions in various countries and these balances routinely exceed deposit insurance limits.As of December 31, 2018, we had $15.6 million invested primarily in preferred stock of privately-held companies that are in the development stage. The fair value of these strategic investments may fluctuate depending on the financial condition and near-term prospects of these companies, and we may be required to record an impairment charge if the carrying value of these investments exceed their fair value.59Table of Contents",2023-12-30 18:26:49.367542
1373715,NOW,"ServiceNow, Inc.",2020,"ITEM 7.MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes appearing under “Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in Item 8 of this filing. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this filing, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. You should carefully read the “Risk Factors” section of this filing for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results and the timing of certain events to differ materially from future results expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.Our free cash flow and billings measures included in the sections entitled “—Key Business Metrics—Free Cash Flow” and “—Key Business Metrics—Billings” are not in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). These non-GAAP financial measures are not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. These measures may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, limiting their usefulness for comparison purposes. We encourage investors to carefully consider our results under GAAP, as well as our supplemental non-GAAP results, to more fully understand our business.This section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K discusses our financial condition and results of operations for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, and year-to-year comparisons between fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018. A discussion of our financial condition and results of operations for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 and year-to-year comparisons between fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017, which have been accounted for and presented to reflect our adoption of Topic 606, that is not included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K can be found in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, filed on February 28, 2019.32Table of ContentsOverview ServiceNow’s purpose is to make the world of work, work better for people. We believe that people should work the way they want to, so we build applications that help automate existing processes and create efficient, digitized workflows. Our products and services enable the steps of a job to flow naturally across disparate departments, systems and processes of a business. When work flows naturally, great experiences follow. We primarily deliver our software via the Internet as a service through a simple and easy-to-use interface so that we can rapidly deploy our packaged offerings, and customers can easily build their custom applications. In a minority of cases, customers choose to host our software by themselves or through a third-party service provider.We generally offer our services on an annual subscription fee basis, which includes access to the ordered subscription service and related support, including updates to the subscription service during the subscription term. Pricing for our subscription services is based on a number of factors, including duration of subscription term, volume, mix of products purchased, and discounts. We sell our products as subscription services and primarily through direct sales. We also offer professional services, both directly and through partners, to help our customers understand and utilize our products and platform more effectively. We also generate revenues from certain professional services and for training of customer and partner personnel. Our professional services organization provides strategic advisory and consulting services to help customers maximize the value of their ServiceNow investment. We generally bill our customers annually in advance for subscription services and monthly in arrears for our professional services as the work is performed.A majority of our revenues come from large global enterprise customers. We continue to invest in the development of our services, infrastructure and sales and marketing to drive long-term growth.Key Business Metrics Number of customers with ACV greater than $1 million. We count the total number of customers with annualized contract value (ACV) greater than $1 million as of the end of the period. We had 892, 677, and 505 customers with ACV greater than $1 million as of December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. For purposes of customer count, a customer is defined as an entity that has a unique Dunn & Bradstreet Global Ultimate (GULT) Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number and an active subscription contract as of the measurement date. The DUNS number is a global standard for business identification and tracking. We make exceptions for holding companies, government entities and other organizations for which the GULT, in our judgment, does not accurately represent the ServiceNow customer. For example, while all U.S. government agencies roll up to “Government of the United States” under the GULT, we count each government agency that we contract with as a separate customer. Our customer count is subject to adjustments for acquisitions, spin-offs and other market activity; accordingly, we restate previously disclosed number of customers with ACV greater than $1 million calculations to allow for comparability. ACV is calculated based on the foreign exchange rate in effect at the time the contract was signed. Foreign exchange rate fluctuations could cause some variability in the number of customers with ACV greater than $1 million.Remaining performance obligations. Transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations (RPO) represents contracted revenue that has not yet been recognized, which includes deferred revenue and non-cancelable amounts that will be invoiced and recognized as revenue in future periods. RPO excludes contracts that are billed in arrears, such as certain time and materials contracts, as we apply the “right to invoice” practical expedient under relevant accounting guidance. As of December 31, 2019, our RPO was approximately $6.6 billion and we expect to recognize revenues on approximately 50% of these RPO over the following 12 months, with the balance to be recognized thereafter. Factors that may cause our RPO to vary from period to period include the following:•Foreign currency exchange rates. While a majority of our contracts have historically been in U.S. Dollars, an increasing percentage of our contracts in recent periods has been in foreign currencies, particularly the Euro and British Pound Sterling. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates as of the balance sheet date will cause variability in our RPO. •Mix of offerings. In a minority of cases, we allow our customers to host our software by themselves or through a third-party service provider. In self-hosted offerings, we recognize a portion of the revenue upfront upon the delivery of the software and as a result, such revenue is excluded from RPO. •Subscription start date. From time to time, we enter into contracts with a subscription start date in the future and these amounts are included in RPO if such contracts are signed by the balance sheet date. •Timing of contract renewals. While customers typically renew their contracts at the end of the contract term, from time to time, customers may do so either before or after the scheduled expiration date. For example, in cases where we are 33Table of Contentssuccessful in selling additional products or services to an existing customer, a customer may decide to renew its existing contract early to ensure that all its contracts expire on the same date. In other cases, prolonged negotiations or other factors may result in a contract not being renewed until after it has expired. •Contract duration. While we typically enter into multi-year subscription services, the duration of our contracts varies. We sometimes also enter into contracts with durations that have a 12-month or shorter term to enable the contracts to co-terminate with the existing contract. The contract duration will cause variability in our RPO. Free cash flow. We define free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, as GAAP net cash provided by operating activities reduced by purchases of property and equipment. Purchases of property and equipment are otherwise included in cash used in investing activities under GAAP. We believe information regarding free cash flow provides useful information to investors because it is an indicator of the strength and performance of our business operations. However, our calculation of free cash flow may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies. The calculation of free cash flow is provided below: Year Ended December 31, 2019 2018 2017 (in thousands)Free cash flow: Net cash provided by operating activities$1,235,972 $811,089 $642,940Purchases of property and equipment(264,892) (224,462) (150,510)Free cash flow (1)$971,080 $586,627 $492,430(1)Free cash flow for the year ended December 31, 2018 includes the effect of $145.3 million relating to the repayments of convertible senior notes attributable to debt discount. Refer to Note 11 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details.Billings. We define billings, a non-GAAP financial measure, as GAAP revenues recognized plus the change in total GAAP unbilled receivables, deferred revenue and customer deposits as presented on the consolidated statements of cash flows. The calculation of billings is provided below: Year Ended December 31, 2019 2018 2017 (dollars in thousands)Billings: Total revenues$3,460,437 $2,608,816 $1,918,494Change in deferred revenue, unbilled receivables and customer deposits(1) 541,776 480,019 381,160Total billings$4,002,213 $3,088,835 $2,299,654Year-over-year percentage change in total billings30% 34% 37%(1)As presented on or derived from our consolidated statements of cash flows.Billings consists of amounts invoiced for subscription contracts with existing customers, renewal contracts, expansion contracts, contracts with new customers, and contracts for professional services and training. Factors that may cause our billings results to vary from period to period include the following:•Billings duration. While we typically bill customers annually for our subscription services, customers sometimes request, and we accommodate, billings with durations less than or greater than the typical 12-month term. •Contract start date. From time to time, we enter into contracts with a contract start date in the future, and we exclude these amounts from billings as these amounts are not included in our consolidated balance sheets, unless such amounts have been paid as of the balance sheet date. •Foreign currency exchange rates. While a majority of our billings have historically been in U.S. Dollars, an increasing percentage of our billings in recent periods has been in foreign currencies, particularly the Euro and British Pound Sterling. 34Table of Contents•Timing of contract renewals. While customers typically renew their contracts at the end of the contract term, from time to time customers may do so either before or after the scheduled expiration date. For example, in cases where we are successful in selling additional products or services to an existing customer, a customer may decide to renew its existing contract early to ensure that all its contracts expire on the same date. In other cases, prolonged negotiations or other factors may result in a contract not being renewed until after it has expired.While we believe billings is a useful leading indicator regarding the performance of our business, due to the factors described above, an increase or decrease in new or renewed subscriptions in a reporting period may not have an immediate impact on billings for that reporting period.To facilitate greater year-over-year comparability in our billings results, we disclose the impact that foreign currency rate fluctuations and fluctuations in billings duration had on our billings. The impact of foreign currency rate fluctuations is calculated by translating the current period results for entities reporting in currencies other than U.S. Dollars into U.S. Dollars at the exchange rates in effect during the prior period presented, rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the current period. The impact of fluctuations in billings duration is calculated by replacing the portion of multi-year billings in excess of 12 months during the current period with the portion of multi-year billings in excess of 12 months during the prior period presented. Notwithstanding the adjustments described above, the comparability of billings results from period to period remains subject to the impact of variations in the dollar value of contracts with future start dates and the timing of contract renewals, for which no adjustments have been presented.Foreign currency rate fluctuations had an unfavorable impact of $67.7 million and a favorable impact of $31.0 million on billings for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Changes in billings duration had a favorable impact of $1.2 million and $7.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.Renewal rate. We calculate our renewal rate by subtracting our attrition rate from 100%. Our attrition rate for a period is equal to the ACV from customers lost during the period, divided by the sum of (i) the total ACV from all customers that renewed during the period, excluding changes in price or users, and (ii) the total ACV from all customers lost during the period. Accordingly, our renewal rate is calculated based on ACV and is not based on the number of customers that have renewed. Further, our renewal rate does not reflect increased or decreased purchases from our customers to the extent such customers are not lost customers. A lost customer is a customer that did not renew an expiring contract and that, in our judgment, will not be renewed. Typically, a customer that reduces its subscription upon renewal is not considered a lost customer. However, in instances where the subscription decrease represents the majority of the customer’s ACV, we may deem the renewal as a lost customer or lapsed renewal. For our renewal rate calculation, we define a customer as an entity with a separate production instance of our service and an active subscription contract as of the measurement date, instead of an entity with a unique GULT or DUNS number. We adjust our renewal rate for acquisitions, consolidations and other customer events that cause the merging of two or more accounts occurring at the time of renewal. Previously disclosed renewal rates may be restated to reflect such adjustments to allow for comparability. Our renewal rate was 98% for each of the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, and 97% for the year ended December 31, 2017. As our renewal rate is impacted by the timing of renewals, which could occur in advance of, or subsequent to the original contract end date, period-to-period comparison of renewal rates may not be meaningful.Components of Results of Operations RevenuesSubscription revenues. Subscription revenues are primarily comprised of fees that give customers access to the ordered subscription service for both self-hosted offerings and cloud-based subscription offerings, and related support and updates, if any, to the subscription service during the subscription term. For our cloud-based offerings, we recognize revenue ratably over the subscription term. For self-hosted offerings, a substantial portion of the sales price is recognized upon delivery of the software, which may cause greater variability in our subscription revenues and subscription gross margin. Pricing includes multiple instances, hosting and support services, data backup and disaster recovery services, as well as future updates, when and if available, offered during the subscription term. We typically invoice our customers for subscription fees in annual increments upon execution of the initial contract or subsequent renewal. Our contracts are generally non-cancelable during the subscription term, though a customer can terminate for breach if we materially fail to perform. 35Table of ContentsProfessional services and other revenues. Our arrangements for professional services are primarily on a time-and-materials basis, and we generally invoice our customers monthly in arrears for these professional services based on actual hours and expenses incurred. Some of our professional services arrangements are on a fixed fee or subscription basis. Professional services revenues are recognized as services are delivered. Other revenues primarily consist of fees from customer training delivered on-site or through publicly available classes. Typical payment terms require our customers to pay us within 30 days of invoice. We sell our subscription services primarily through our direct sales organization. We also sell services through managed services providers and resale partners. We also generate revenues from certain professional services and for training of customers and partner personnel, through both our direct team and indirect channel sales. Revenues from our direct sales organization represented 82%, 84% and 88% for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. For purposes of calculating revenues from our direct sales organization, revenues from systems integrators and managed services providers are included as part of the direct sales organization. Allocation of Overhead CostsOverhead costs associated with office facilities, IT and certain depreciation related to infrastructure that is not dedicated for customer use or research and development use are allocated to cost of revenues and operating expenses based on headcount. Cost of RevenuesCost of subscription revenues. Cost of subscription revenues consists primarily of expenses related to hosting our services and providing support to our customers. These expenses are comprised of data center capacity costs, which include colocation costs associated with our data centers as well as interconnectivity between data centers, depreciation related to our infrastructure hardware equipment dedicated for customer use, amortization of intangible assets, expenses associated with software, IT services and support dedicated for customer use, personnel-related costs directly associated with data center operations and customer support, including salaries, benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation and allocated overhead.Cost of professional services and other revenues. Cost of professional services and other revenues consists primarily of personnel-related costs directly associated with our professional services and training departments, including salaries, benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation, the costs of contracted third-party partners, travel expenses and allocated overhead.Professional services are performed directly by our services team, as well as by contracted third-party partners. Fees paid by us to third-party partners are primarily recognized as cost of revenues as the professional services are delivered. Cost of revenues associated with our professional services engagements contracted with third-party partners as a percentage of professional services and other revenues was 15%, 18% and 22% for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.Sales and MarketingSales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel-related expenses directly associated with our sales and marketing staff, including salaries, benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation. Sales and marketing expenses also include the amortization of commissions paid to our sales employees, including related payroll taxes and fringe benefits. From time to time, third parties provide us referrals for which we pay a referral fee. We include revenues associated with these referrals as part of revenues from our direct sales organization. Referral fees paid to these third parties are generally 10% of the customer’s net new ACV. We defer referral fees paid as they are considered incremental selling costs associated with acquiring customer contracts, and include the amortization of these referral fees in sales and marketing expense. In addition, sales and marketing expenses include branding expenses, expenses offset by proceeds related to our annual Knowledge user conference (Knowledge), other marketing program expenses, which include events other than Knowledge, and costs associated with purchasing advertising and marketing data, software and subscription services dedicated for sales and marketing use and allocated overhead.Research and DevelopmentResearch and development expenses consist primarily of personnel-related expenses directly associated with our research and development staff, including salaries, benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation and allocated overhead. Research and development expenses also include data center capacity costs, costs associated with outside services contracted for research and development purposes and depreciation of infrastructure hardware equipment that is used solely for research and development purposes. 36Table of ContentsGeneral and AdministrativeGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel-related expenses for our executive, finance, legal, human resources, facilities and administrative personnel, including salaries, benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation, external legal, accounting and other professional services fees, other corporate expenses, amortization of intangible assets and allocated overhead.Provision for Income TaxesProvision for income taxes consists of federal, state and foreign income taxes. Due to cumulative losses, we maintain a valuation allowance against our U.S. deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2019 and 2018. We consider all available evidence, both positive and negative, including but not limited to earnings history, projected future outcomes, industry and market trends and the nature of each of the deferred tax assets in assessing the extent to which a valuation allowance should be applied against our U.S. and foreign deferred tax assets.

Included in subscription revenues is $164.1 million and $118.5 million of revenues recognized upfront from the delivery of software associated with self-hosted offerings during the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. We expect subscription revenues for the year ending December 31, 2020 to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to add new customers and existing customers increase their usage of our products, and increase slightly as a percentage of total revenues compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. Our expectations for revenues, cost of revenues and operating expenses for the year ending December 31, 2020 are based on foreign exchange rates as of December 31, 2019.37Table of ContentsSubscription revenues consist of the following: Year Ended December 31, % Change 2019 2018 (dollars in thousands) Digital workflow products(1)$2,810,887 $2,111,702 33%ITOM products(1)444,192 309,611 43%Total subscription revenues$3,255,079 $2,421,313 34%(1)As we have expanded the scope of IntegrationHub (formerly included within our ITOM offering) beyond ITOM to align more closely with our broader platform offering, revenues associated with IntegrationHub have been reclassified from ITOM products to platform, which is part of our digital workflow products. Revenues reclassified from ITOM product revenues to digital workflow products revenues were $60.9 million and $44.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. These reclassifications did not result in a restatement of prior period financial statements.Our digital workflow products include the Now Platform, Now IT Service Management, Now IT Business Management, Now DevOps, Now IT Asset Management, Now Security Operations, Now Integrated Risk Management, Now HR Service Delivery, Now Finance Operations Management, Now Customer Service Management, and Now Field Service Management, and are generally priced on a per user basis. Our ITOM products are generally priced on a per node (physical or virtual server) basis. In previously issued consolidated financial statements, we referred to digital workflow products as “service management products.” Professional services and other revenues increased $17.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the prior year, due to an increase in the services provided to new and existing customers. We expect professional services and other revenues for the year ending December 31, 2020 to increase in absolute dollars, but decrease slightly as a percentage of total revenues compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 as we are increasingly focused on deploying our internal professional services organization as a strategic resource and relying on our partner ecosystem to contract directly with customers for service delivery.

The remaining increase of $61.7 million was primarily due to increases in data center hardware, software and maintenance costs to support the expansion of our data center capacity. Amortization of intangibles increased $5.1 million as a result of current year acquisitions. 38Table of ContentsOur subscription gross profit percentage was 83% for each of the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. The increase in revenues recognized upfront from the delivery of software associated with self-hosted offerings contributed to approximately one percentage point improvement in our subscription gross profit percentage for each of the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. We expect our cost of subscription revenues to increase in absolute dollars as we provide subscription services to more customers and increase usage within our customer instances, and our subscription gross profit percentage to remain relatively flat for the year ending December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. To the extent future acquisitions are consummated, our cost of subscription revenues may increase due to additional non-cash charges associated with the amortization of intangible assets acquired. Cost of professional services and other revenues increased $41.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the prior year, primarily due to increased headcount resulting in an increase of $24.9 million in personnel-related costs excluding stock-based compensation, an increase of $10.3 million in stock-based compensation and an increase of $5.4 million in overhead expenses.Our professional services and other gross loss percentage increased to 20% during the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to 9% in the prior year, primarily due to stock-based compensation and other personnel-related costs increasing at a higher rate than professional services and other revenues as we continue to invest in specialized resources to support our expanding product portfolio and new on-demand training, increasing the training content available online.Sales and Marketing Year Ended December 31 % Change 2019 2018 (dollars in thousands) Sales and marketing$1,534,284 $1,203,056 28%Percentage of revenues44% 46% Sales and marketing expenses increased $331.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the prior year, primarily due to increased headcount resulting in an increase of $154.8 million in personnel-related costs excluding stock-based compensation and commissions, an increase of $40.4 million in stock-based compensation and an increase of $37.1 million in overhead expenses. Expenses associated with commissions and third-party referral fees increased $26.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the prior year, due to an increase in contracts with new customers, expansion and renewal contracts. Outside services costs increased $12.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the prior year, primarily due to an increase in contractors and professional fees to support our sales and marketing functions. Branding and marketing program expenses, and costs associated with purchasing advertising and market data, increased $56.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the prior year. We expect sales and marketing expenses for the year ending December 31, 2020 to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to expand our direct sales organization, increase our marketing activities, grow our international operations and build brand awareness, but decrease slightly as a percentage of total revenues compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. 39Table of ContentsResearch and Development Year Ended December 31 % Change 2019 2018 (dollars in thousands) Research and development$748,369 $529,501 41%Percentage of revenues22% 20% Research and development expenses increased $218.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the prior year, primarily due to increased headcount, which resulted in an increase of $114.0 million in personnel-related costs excluding stock-based compensation, an increase of $59.6 million in stock-based compensation and an increase of $33.9 million in overhead expenses. The remaining increase of $4.3 million was primarily due to increases in data center capacity and depreciation costs. We expect research and development expenses for the year ending December 31, 2020 to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to improve the existing functionality of our services, develop new applications to fill market needs and enhance our core platform, and increase slightly as a percentage of total revenues compared to the year ended December 31, 2019.General and Administrative Year Ended December 31 % Change 2019 2018 (dollars in thousands) General and administrative$339,016 $296,027 15%Percentage of revenues10% 12% General and administrative expenses increased $43.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the prior year, primarily due to increased headcount, which resulted in an increase of $36.3 million in personnel-related costs excluding stock-based compensation, an increase of $7.4 million in overhead and other expenses. Amortization of intangibles increased $4.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the prior year, as a result of acquisitions. Outside services costs increased $10.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the prior year, primarily due to an increase in contractors and professional fees to support our administrative function. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in stock-based compensation of $16.0 million, primarily attributable to the forfeiture of certain awards by our former Chief Executive Officer and former Chief Financial Officer.We expect general and administrative expenses to increase in absolute dollars for the year ending December 31, 2020 as we continue to hire new employees, but remain relatively flat as a percentage of total revenues compared to December 31, 2019. 40Table of ContentsStock-based Compensation Year Ended December 31 % Change 2019 2018 (dollars in thousands) Cost of revenues: Subscription$72,728 $48,738 49%Professional services and other43,123 32,816 31%Sales and marketing268,408 228,045 18%Research and development194,821 135,203 44%General and administrative83,115 99,151 (16%)Total stock-based compensation$662,195 $543,953 22%Percentage of revenues19% 21% Stock-based compensation expense increased $118.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the prior year, primarily due to additional grants to current and new employees and increased weighted-average grant date fair value of stock awards. Stock-based compensation expense is inherently difficult to forecast due to fluctuations in our stock price. Based upon our stock price as of December 31, 2019, we expect stock-based compensation expense to continue to increase in absolute dollars for the year ending December 31, 2020 as we continue to issue stock-based awards to our employees, but remain relatively flat as a percentage of total revenues compared to the year ended December 31, 2019.Foreign Currency ExchangeOur international operations have provided and will continue to provide a significant portion of our total revenues. Revenues outside North America represented 34% of total revenues for each of the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. Because we primarily transact in foreign currencies for sales outside of the United States, the general strengthening of the U.S. Dollar relative to other major foreign currencies (primarily the Euro and British Pound Sterling) from the year ended December 31, 2018 to the year ended December 31, 2019 had an unfavorable impact on our revenues. For entities reporting in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar, if we had translated our results for the year ended December 31, 2019 at the average exchange rates in effect for the year ended December 31, 2018 rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the period, our reported subscription revenues would have been $57.6 million higher and our reported professional services and other revenues would have been $4.8 million higher. In addition, because we primarily transact in foreign currencies for cost of sales and operating expenses outside of the United States, the general strengthening of the U.S. Dollar relative to other major foreign currencies from the year ended December 31, 2018 to the year ended December 31, 2019 had a favorable impact on our cost of sales and operating expenses. For entities reporting in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar, if we had translated our results for the year ended December 31, 2019 at the average exchange rates in effect for the year ended December 31, 2018 rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the period, our reported cost of subscription revenues, cost of professional services and other revenues, sales and marketing expenses and research and development expenses would have been $8.0 million, $4.0 million, $19.1 million and $2.3 million higher, respectively. The impact from the foreign currency movements from the year ended December 31, 2018 to the year ended December 31, 2019 is not material to general and administrative expenses.41Table of ContentsInterest Expense Year Ended December 31 % Change 2019 2018 (dollars in thousands) Interest expense$(33,283) $(52,733) (37%)Percentage of revenues(1%) (2%) Interest expense decreased $19.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the prior year, due to the repayments of the 2018 Notes that occurred in 2018.

Interest income and other income (expense), net increased $2.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the prior year, primarily due to an increase of $20.8 million in interest income resulting from higher cash and investment balances and higher yields on our invested balances during the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $2.1 million in other due to an unrealized gain on non-marketable securities relating to observable price changes and the absence of a $4.1 million loss recorded on early note conversions in the prior year. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $19.3 million in realized gains relating to changes in the market value of our marketable equity securities held and sold in the prior year, and a decrease of $7.2 million due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, net of the effect of our foreign currency derivative contracts. To mitigate our risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, we enter into foreign currency derivative contracts with maturities of 12 months or less to hedge a portion of our net outstanding monetary assets and liabilities. These hedging contracts may reduce, but cannot entirely eliminate, the impact of adverse currency exchange rate movements.

See Note 17 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for our reconciliation of income taxes at the statutory federal rate to the provision for income taxes.We maintained a full valuation allowance on our U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. In addition, we maintained a valuation allowance against certain foreign deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2018. The significant components of the tax expense recorded are current cash taxes payable in various jurisdictions. The cash tax expenses are impacted by each jurisdiction’s individual tax rates, laws on timing of recognition of income and deductions, and availability of net operating losses and tax credits. Given the full valuation allowance on our U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets, sensitivity of current cash taxes to local rules and our foreign structuring, we expect that our effective tax rate could fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis and could be adversely affected to the extent earnings are lower than anticipated in countries that have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher statutory rates. To the extent sufficient positive evidence becomes available, we may release all or a portion of our valuation allowance in one or more future periods. A release of the valuation allowance, if any, would result in the recognition of certain deferred tax assets and a material income tax benefit for the period in which such release is recorded. Quarterly Results of Operations The following table sets forth our selected unaudited quarterly consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). We have prepared the quarterly data on a consistent basis with the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In the opinion of management, the financial information reflects all necessary adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair statement of this data. This information should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

We sign a significantly higher percentage of agreements with new customers, as well as renewal agreements with existing customers, in the quarter ended December 31. The increase in customer agreements for the quarter ended December 31 is primarily a result of both the terms of our commission plans which incentivize our direct sales organization to meet their annual quotas by December 31 and the large enterprise account buying patterns typical in the software industry, which are driven primarily by the expiration of annual authorized budgeted expenditures. As a result, our billings and sequential growth in RPO has been historically highest in the quarter ended December 31. While we continue to see an increase in the number of agreements entered into with the U.S. Federal government throughout the year as it modernizes its IT infrastructure and accelerates its use of modern technology to digitally transform how it operates, the number of agreements entered into with the U.S. federal government has historically been higher in the quarter ended September 30, driven primarily by timing of annual budget expenditures. Furthermore, we usually sign a significant portion of our customer agreements during the last month, and often the last two weeks, of each quarter. This seasonality in the timing of entering into customer contracts is sometimes not immediately apparent in our billings, due to the fact that we typically exclude cloud-offering contracts with a future start date from our billings, unless such amounts have been paid as of the balance sheet date. Similarly, this seasonality is reflected to a much lesser extent, and sometimes is not immediately apparent in our revenues, due to the fact that we recognize subscription revenues from our cloud offering contracts over the term of the subscription agreement, which is generally 12 to 36 months. Although these seasonal factors are common in the technology industry, historical patterns should not be considered a reliable indicator of our future sales activity or performance. Our revenues have increased over the periods presented due to increased sales to new and existing customers. Our operating expenses have increased over the periods presented due to increases in headcount, data center operations and other related expenses to support our growth. We have historically seen an increase in marketing expenses in the quarter ended June 30, and a corresponding decrease in marketing expenses in the quarter ended September 30 due to the expenses incurred for our annual Knowledge user conference, partially offset by related proceeds. Marketing expenses in the quarter ended December 31 are also historically higher due to user forums we conduct in that quarter. We anticipate operating expenses will continue to increase in future periods as we continue to focus on investing in the long-term growth of our business.Our free cash flow is impacted by the timing of collections and disbursements, including the timing of capital expenditures. We have historically seen higher collections in the quarter ended March 31 due to seasonality in timing of entering into customer contracts as described above. We have historically seen higher disbursements in the quarters ended March 31 and September 30, due to payouts under our annual commission plans in the quarter ended March 31, purchases under our employee stock purchase plan in both quarters ended March 31 and September 30, and payouts under our bonus plans in both quarters ended March 31 and September 30.44Table of ContentsLiquidity and Capital Resources Our principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents, investments, and cash generated from operations. As of December 31, 2019, we had $1.7 billion in cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, of which $202.8 million represented cash held by foreign subsidiaries and $192.2 million is denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. In addition, we had $1.0 billion in long-term investments that provide additional capital resources. We do not anticipate that we will need funds generated from foreign operations to fund our domestic operations.Prior to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the Tax Act), we considered earnings from foreign operations to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the United States. Subsequent to the enactment of the Tax Act, we determined that the unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries will no longer be considered indefinitely reinvested, except in certain designated jurisdictions in which the resident entity is a service provider which is not expected to generate substantial amounts of cash in excess of what may be reinvested by the local entity. In May and June 2017, we issued the 2022 Notes with an aggregate principal amount of $782.5 million. In connection with the issuance of the 2022 Notes, we entered into the 2022 Note Hedge transactions and 2022 Warrant transactions with certain financial institutions. The price of our common stock was greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price of the 2022 Notes for at least 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the quarters ended June 30, 2018 through December 31, 2019, except for the quarter ended December 31, 2018. Therefore, our 2022 Notes became convertible at the holders’ option beginning on July 1, 2018 and continue to be convertible through March 31, 2020, except for the quarter ended March 31, 2019 because the Conversion Condition for the 2022 Notes was not met for the quarter ended December 31, 2018. The impact of the 2022 Notes on our liquidity will depend on the settlement method we elect. We currently intend to settle the principal amount of any converted 2022 Notes in cash. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we paid cash to settle an immaterial principal amount of the 2022 Notes. Based on additional conversion requests we have received through the filing date, we expect to settle in cash an aggregate of approximately $2.5 million and $5.2 million in principal amount of the 2022 Notes during the first and second quarters of 2020, respectively. We may receive additional conversion requests that require settlement in the second quarter of 2020. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we issued approximately 4.3 million shares of our common stock upon the automatic exercise of the 2018 Warrants. The 2018 Warrants were no longer outstanding as of the second quarter of 2019. We expect to issue additional shares of our common stock in the second half of 2022 upon the automatic exercise of the 2022 Warrants. As the 2022 Warrants will be net share settled, there will be no impact on our liquidity. The total number of shares of our common stock we will issue depends on the daily volume-weighted average stock prices over a 60 trading day period beginning on the first expiration date of the 2022 Warrants, which will be September 1, 2022. Refer to Note 11 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. We anticipate our current cash and cash equivalents balance and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs, including the repayment of our 2022 Notes, expansion of data centers, lease obligations, expenditures related to the growth of our headcount and the acquisition of property and equipment, intangibles, and investments in office facilities, to accommodate our growth for at least the next 12 months. Whether these resources are adequate to meet our liquidity needs beyond that period will depend on our growth, operating results, cash utilized for acquisitions and/or debt retirements if any are consummated, and the capital expenditures required to meet possible increased demand for our services. If we require additional capital resources to grow our business at any time in the future, we may seek to finance our operations from the current funds available or seek additional equity or debt financing.45Table of Contents Year Ended December 31, 2019 2018 (in thousands)Net cash provided by operating activities$1,235,972 $811,089Net cash used in investing activities(724,477) (347,422)Net cash used in financing activities(301,856) (607,428)Net increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash209,453 (159,291)Operating ActivitiesCash provided by operating activities mainly consists of our net income (loss) adjusted for repayments of convertible senior notes attributable to debt discount, certain non-cash items, including depreciation and amortization, amortization of deferred commissions, amortization of issuance cost and debt discount, stock-based compensation, deferred income taxes, and changes in operating assets and liabilities during the year.Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $811.1 million for the prior year. The increase in operating cash flow was primarily due to the repayments of convertible senior notes attributable to debt discount that were made during the year ended December 31, 2018 and the favorable impact on operating cash flow from the change in net income (loss) adjusted for non-cash items to reconcile net income (loss) to net cash provided by operations, offset by the unfavorable impact on operating cash flow from changes in operating assets and liabilities. Investing ActivitiesNet cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $724.5 million compared to $347.4 million for the prior year. The increase in cash used in investing activities was mainly due to a $341.8 million increase in net purchases of investments, a $48.3 million increase in purchases of other intangibles, and a $40.4 million increase in capital expenditures related to the purchases of infrastructure hardware equipment as well as investments in leasehold improvements, furniture and equipment to support our headcount growth. The increase in cash used in investing activities was partially offset by a $30.0 million decrease in cash outflow for business combinations, net of cash and restricted cash acquired and a $23.4 million increase in net realized gains on derivatives not designated as hedging instruments. Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $301.9 million compared to $607.4 million for the prior year due to repayments of convertible senior notes attributable to principal of $429.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, a $3.7 million increase in proceeds from employee equity plans, and partially offset by a $128.7 million increase in taxes paid related to net share settlement of equity awards.46Table of ContentsContractual Obligations and CommitmentsThe following table represents our future non-cancelable contractual obligations as of December 31, 2019, aggregated by type: Payments Due by Period Total LessThan1 Year 1 – 3Years 3 – 5Years MoreThan5 Years (in thousands)Operating leases, including imputed interest (1)$530,699 $67,629 $128,688 $103,777 $230,605Purchase obligations (2)180,239 70,819 95,022 11,768 2,630Principal amount payable on our convertible senior notes (3)782,491 — 782,491 — —Total contractual obligations$1,493,429 $138,448 $1,006,201 $115,545 $233,235(1)Consists of future non-cancelable minimum rental payments under operating leases for some of our offices and data centers.(2)Consists of future minimum payments under non-cancelable purchase commitments related to our daily business operations. Not included in the table above are certain purchase commitments related to our future annual Knowledge user conferences and other customer or sales conferences to be held in 2021 and future years. If we were to cancel these contractual commitments as of December 31, 2019, we would have been obligated to pay cancellation penalties of approximately $16.3 million in aggregate.(3)For additional information regarding our convertible senior notes, refer to Note 11 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.In addition to the obligations in the table above, $6.1 million of unrecognized tax benefits have been recorded as liabilities as of December 31, 2019. It is uncertain if or when such amounts may be settled. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements During all periods presented, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. As such, we are not exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in those types of relationships.Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and EstimatesOur management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. These items are monitored and analyzed by us for changes in facts and circumstances, and material changes in these estimates could occur in the future. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Changes in estimates are reflected in reported results for the period in which they become known. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions and such differences could be material.While our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe that the following accounting policies are critical to the process of making significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our audited consolidated financial statements.Revenue RecognitionWe report our revenues in two categories: (i) subscriptions and (ii) professional services and other. Revenues are recognized when control of these services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those services. 47Table of ContentsWe determine revenue recognition through the following steps:•Identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer;•Identification of the performance obligations in the contract;•Determination of the transaction price;•Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and•Recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation.Subscription revenuesSubscription revenues are primarily comprised of subscription fees that give customers access to the ordered subscription service, related support and updates, if any, to the subscribed service during the subscription term. For our cloud services, we recognize subscription revenues ratably over the contract term beginning on the commencement date of each contract, the date we make our services available to our customers. Our contracts with customers typically include a fixed amount of consideration and are generally non-cancelable and without any refund-type provisions. We typically invoice our customers annually in advance for our subscription services upon execution of the initial contract or subsequent renewal, and our invoices are typically due within 30 days from the invoice date.Subscription revenues also include revenues from self-hosted offerings in which customers deploy, or we grant customers the option to deploy without significant penalty, our subscription service internally or contract with a third party to host the software. For these contracts, we account for the software element and the related support and updates separately as they are distinct performance obligations (refer to the discussion below related to contracts with multiple performance obligations for further details). The transaction price is allocated to separate performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price (SSP) basis. The transaction price allocated to the software element is recognized when transfer of control of the software to the customer is complete. The transaction price allocated to the related support and updates are recognized ratably over the contract term. Professional services and other revenuesOur professional services arrangements are primarily on a time-and-materials basis, and we generally invoice our customers monthly in arrears for these professional services based on actual hours and expenses incurred. Some of our professional services arrangements are on a fixed fee or subscription basis. Professional services revenues are recognized as services are delivered. Other revenues consist of fees from customer training delivered on-site or through publicly available classes. Typical payment terms require our customers to pay us within 30 days of invoice.Contracts with multiple performance obligationsWe enter into contracts that can include various combinations of products and services, which are generally capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations. For these contracts, the transaction price is allocated to the separate performance obligations on a relative SSP basis. Evaluating the terms and conditions included within our customer contracts for appropriate revenue recognition and determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment.Deferred CommissionsDeferred commissions are the incremental selling costs that are associated with acquiring customer contracts and consist primarily of sales commissions paid to our sales force and referral fees paid to independent third parties. Capitalized sales commissions also include the associated payroll taxes and fringe benefit costs associated with payments to our sales employees to the extent they are incremental. Commissions and referral fees earned upon the execution of initial and expansion contracts are primarily deferred and amortized over a period of benefit that we have determined to be five years. Commissions earned upon the renewal of customer contracts are deferred and amortized over the average renewal term. Additionally, for self-hosted offerings, consistent with the recognition of subscription revenues for self-hosted offerings, a portion of the commission cost is expensed upfront when the self-hosted offering is made available. The determination of the period of benefit requires significant judgment by taking into consideration our customer contracts, our technology life cycle and other factors. We include amortization of deferred commissions in sales and marketing expense in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss).48Table of Contents Business combinationsWe apply a screen test to evaluate if substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets to determine whether a transaction is accounted for as an asset acquisition or business combination. If the screen test is not met, the integrated set of activities and assets is considered a business based on whether there are inputs and substantive processes in place. The allocation of the purchase price requires us to make significant estimates in determining the fair value of acquired assets and assumed liabilities, especially with respect to intangible assets. The excess of the purchase price in a business combination over the fair value of these tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. These estimates are based upon a number of factors, including historical experience, market conditions and information obtained from the management of the acquired company. Critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets included, but are not limited to, cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future, discount rates, the time and expense that would be necessary to recreate the assets and the profit margin a market participant would receive. These estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. Stock-based Compensation We recognize compensation expense related to stock options and restricted stock units (RSUs) with only service conditions on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the four-year vesting term. For stock options and RSUs granted with both service conditions and performance or market conditions, the expenses are recognized on a graded vesting basis over the requisite service period and, for awards with performance conditions, when it is probable that the performance conditions will be achieved. This has the impact of greater stock-based compensation expense during the initial years of the vesting period as stock-based compensation cost is recognized over the requisite service period for each separately vesting tranche of the award as though the award were, in substance, multiple awards. We recognize compensation expense related to shares issued pursuant to the employee stock purchase plan (ESPP) on a straight-line basis over the six-month offering period. We estimate the fair value of stock option grants with only service conditions and shares issued pursuant to the ESPP using the Black-Scholes options pricing model and fair value of RSU awards (including performance-based RSUs) using the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant. We recognize compensation expense net of estimated forfeiture activity, which is based on historical forfeiture rates. We evaluate the forfeiture rates at least annually or when events or circumstances indicate a change may be needed. This may cause a fluctuation in our stock-based compensation in the period of change.Income Taxes We use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes, in which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. We measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be reversed. We recognize the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates as income and expense in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is established if it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. In determining the need for a valuation allowance, we consider future growth, forecasted earnings, future taxable income, the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate, historical earnings, taxable income in prior years, if carryback is permitted under the law, carryforward periods and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. To the extent sufficient positive evidence becomes available, we may release all or a portion of our valuation allowance in one or more future periods. A release of the valuation allowance, if any, would result in the recognition of certain deferred tax assets and a material income tax benefit for the period in which such release is recorded. Due to cumulative losses over recent years and based on all available positive and negative evidence, we have determined that it is more likely than not that our U.S. deferred tax assets will not be realizable as of December 31, 2019. We recognized an income tax benefit of $574.2 million due to the release of the valuation allowance on the Irish deferred tax assets for the year ended December 31, 2019. These Irish deferred tax assets were created primarily as a result of the difference between the tax basis in our Irish subsidiary and the cost reported in our consolidated financial statements resulting from the transfer of intangible assets to the Irish subsidiary as part of our foreign restructuring in 2018. Management applied significant judgment in assessing the positive and negative evidence available in the determination of the amount of deferred tax assets that were more likely than not to be realized in the future. In determining the need, or continued need, for a valuation allowance, we considered the weighting of the positive and negative evidence, which includes, among other things, emergence from a cumulative loss position over the previous three years during the fourth quarter of 2019, historical earnings, future growth, forecasted earnings, and future taxable income.49Table of ContentsOur tax positions are subject to income tax audits by multiple tax jurisdictions throughout the world. We recognize the tax benefit of an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not the position is sustainable upon examination by the taxing authority based on the technical merits. We measure the tax benefit recognized as the largest amount of benefit which is more likely than not to be realized upon settlement with the taxing authority. We recognize interest accrued and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in our tax provision. Significant judgment is required to evaluate uncertain tax positions. Our evaluations are based upon a number of factors, including changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law or guidance, correspondence with tax authorities during the course of audits and effective settlement of audit issues. Changes in the recognition or measurement of uncertain tax positions could result in material increases or decreases in our income tax expense in the period in which we make the change, which could have a material impact on our effective tax rate and operating results.We calculate the current and deferred income tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed in subsequent years and record adjustments based on filed income tax returns when identified. The amount of income taxes paid is subject to examination by U.S. federal, state and foreign tax authorities. The estimate of the potential outcome of any uncertain tax issue is subject to management’s assessment of relevant risks, facts and circumstances existing at that time. To the extent the assessment of such tax position changes, we record the change in estimate in the period in which we make the determination.New Accounting Pronouncements Pending AdoptionThe impact of recently issued accounting standards is set forth in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.ITEM 7A.QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKForeign Currency Exchange RiskWe have foreign currency risks related to our revenue and operating expenses denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar, primarily the Euro and British Pound Sterling. We are a net receiver of Euro and British Pound Sterling, and therefore benefit from a weakening of the U.S. Dollar relative to these currencies and, conversely, are adversely affected by a strengthening of the U.S. Dollar relative to these currencies. Revenues denominated in U.S. Dollar as a percentage of total revenues was 71% during each of the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, and 73% during the year ended December 31, 2017. To mitigate our risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, we initiated a limited hedging program during the year ended December 31, 2018 by entering into foreign currency derivative contracts to hedge a portion of our net outstanding monetary assets and liabilities. These derivative contracts are intended to offset gains or losses related to remeasuring monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entities in which they are recorded.A hypothetical 10% increase in the U.S. Dollar against other currencies would have resulted in a decrease in operating income of approximately $30.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 and an increase in operating loss of approximately $23.4 million and $15.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. This analysis disregards the possibilities that rates can move in opposite directions and that losses from one geographic area may be offset by gains from another geographic area.These derivative contracts expose us to credit risk to the extent that the counterparties may be unable to meet the terms of the arrangement. We mitigate this credit risk by transacting with major financial institutions with high credit ratings and entering into master netting arrangements, which permit net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty. While the contract or notional amount is often used to express the volume of foreign currency derivative contracts, the amounts potentially subject to credit risk are generally limited to the amounts, if any, by which the counterparties’ obligations under the agreements exceed our obligations to the counterparties. We are not required to pledge, and are not entitled to receive, cash collateral related to these derivative instruments. We do not enter into derivative contracts for trading or speculative purposes. Refer to Note 8 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. 50Table of ContentsInterest Rate Sensitivity We had an aggregate of $2.7 billion in cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and long-term investments as of December 31, 2019. This amount was invested primarily in money market funds, certificates of deposit, corporate notes and bonds, government and agency securities and other debt securities with a minimum rating of BBB by Standard & Poor’s, Baa2 by Moody’s, or BBB by Fitch. The primary objectives of our investment activities are the preservation of capital and support of our liquidity requirements. Our investments are exposed to market risk due to fluctuations in interest rates, which may affect our interest income and the fair market value of our investments. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would have resulted in an approximate $14.3 million decline of the fair value of our available-for-sale securities. This estimate is based on a sensitivity model that measures market value changes when changes in interest rates occur.As of December 31, 2018, we had an aggregate of $2.1 billion in cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and long-term investments, and a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would have resulted in an approximate $9.2 million decline of the fair value of our available-for-sale securities. Market RiskIn May and June 2017, we issued the 2022 Notes with an aggregate principal amount of $782.5 million. We carry these instruments at face value less unamortized discount on our consolidated balance sheet. Because these instruments do not bear interest, we have no economic interest rate exposure on our 2022 Notes associated with changes in interest rates. However, the fair value of our 2022 Notes is exposed to interest rate risks. Generally, the fair market value of our 2022 Notes will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. In addition, the fair value of the Notes is affected by our stock price due to the conversion feature, and will generally increase as the stock price increases.We hold cash balances with multiple financial institutions in various countries and these balances routinely exceed deposit insurance limits.As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had $22.4 million and $14.6 million, respectively, of equity investment in privately-held companies that are in the development stage. The fair value of these strategic investments may fluctuate depending on the financial condition and near-term prospects of these companies, and we may be required to record an impairment charge if the carrying value of these investments exceed their fair value. In addition, upon adoption of ASU 2016-01 as of January 1, 2018, we are required to measure equity securities at fair value with changes in fair value recognized through our consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). As a result, we anticipate additional volatility to our consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) in future periods, due to the valuation and timing of observable price changes of our investments in privately held securities. These changes could be material based on market conditions and events.51Table of Contents",2023-12-30 18:26:44.714835
1373715,NOW,"ServiceNow, Inc.",2021,"ITEM 7.MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes appearing under “Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in Item 8 of this filing. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this filing, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and other factors. You should carefully read the “Risk Factors” section of this filing for a discussion of important factors, including, but not limited to, impacts on our business, future financial performance and general economic conditions due to the current COVID-19 pandemic, that could cause actual results and the timing of certain events to differ materially from future results expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.Our free cash flow and billings measures included in the sections entitled “—Key Business Metrics—Free Cash Flow” and “—Key Business Metrics—Billings” are not in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”). These non-GAAP financial measures are not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. These measures may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, limiting their usefulness for comparison purposes. We encourage investors to carefully consider our results under GAAP, as well as our supplemental non-GAAP results, to more fully understand our business.This section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K discusses our financial condition and results of operations for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, and year-to-year comparisons between fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019. A discussion of our financial condition and results of operations for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 and year-to-year comparisons between fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018 that is not included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K can be found in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, filed on February 20, 2020.COVID-19 EnvironmentThe COVID-19 pandemic has created significant global economic uncertainty, adversely impacted the business of our customers, partners and vendors, and impacted our business and results of operations. As of the filing date, the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may continue to impact our business and future financial condition or results of operations remains uncertain. We are continuing to monitor the actual and potential effects of the COVID-19 pandemic across our business. While our revenues, billings and earnings are relatively predictable as a result of our subscription-based business model, the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic, along with the seasonality we historically experience, may not be fully reflected in our results of operations and overall financial performance until future periods, if at all, and could cause our future results of operations to vary significantly from period to period. As the uncertainty continues, we may experience an increase in curtailed customer demand, reduced customer spend or contract duration, delayed collections, lengthened payment terms, lengthened sales cycles or competition due to changes in terms and conditions and pricing of our competitors’ products and services, our business, results of operations and overall financial performance in future periods could be materially adversely affected. Additionally, it is unclear to what extent certain reduction in expenditures noted in the current year due to actions taken in response to COVID-19 will continue to be reduced below historical levels. The extent and continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operational and financial performance will depend on certain developments, including: the duration and spread of the outbreak; government responses, including the effectiveness, extent and duration of mitigation efforts such as “shelter in place” and similar directives; impact on our customers, sales cycles and ability to generate new business; impact on our customer, industry or employee events; extent of delays in hiring and onboarding new employees mainly in our general and administrative functions; and effect on our partners, vendors and supply chains; all of which are highly uncertain and difficult to predict. 31Table of ContentsIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we focused on maintaining business continuity, helping our employees, customers and communities, and preparing for the future and the long-term success of our business. In 2020, we released four Emergency Response applications to help customers navigate the COVID-19 pandemic management and the Safe Workplace applications, a four-application suite and dashboard, designed to help companies manage the essential steps for returning employees to the workplace and to support their health and safety. Additionally, we canceled our in-person, annual Knowledge user conference (“Knowledge”) and replaced it with a digital event experience. In the first quarter of 2020, we also temporarily closed most of our offices and encouraged our employees to work remotely. These changes remain in effect in the first quarter of 2021 and could extend into future quarters. The impact, if any, of these and any additional operational changes we may implement is uncertain, but changes we have implemented have not affected and are not expected to affect our ability to maintain operations, including financial reporting systems, internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. See the section “Risk Factors” for further discussion of the possible impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business.Overview ServiceNow’s purpose is to make the world of work, work better for people. We believe that people want the technology they use in their work to be more efficient and easier to use. We build applications to meet that demand by automating existing processes and creating efficient, digitized workflows with a consumer grade user experience. Our products and services enable the steps of a job to flow naturally across disparate departments, systems and processes of a business. When work flows naturally, great experiences follow. We primarily deliver our software via the Internet as a service through a simple and easy-to-use interface so that we can rapidly deploy our packaged offerings, and customers can easily build their custom applications. In a minority of cases, customers choose to host our software by themselves or through a third-party service provider.We generally offer our services on an annual subscription fee basis, which includes access to the ordered subscription service and related standard and enhanced support, including updates to the subscription service during the subscription term. Pricing for our subscription services is based on a number of factors, including duration of subscription term, volume, mix of products purchased, and discounts. We generate sales through our direct sales team and, to a lesser extent, indirectly through resale partners and third-party referrals. We also generate revenues from professional services and for training of customer and partner personnel. Our professional services organization is focused on strategic advisory, implementation and consulting services to accelerate platform adoption and drive customer outcomes. We generally bill our customers annually in advance for subscription services and monthly in arrears for our professional services as the work is performed.A majority of our revenues come from large global enterprise customers. We continue to invest in the development of our services, infrastructure and sales and marketing to drive long-term growth.Key Business MetricsRemaining performance obligations. Transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations (“RPO”) represents contracted revenue that has not yet been recognized, which includes deferred revenue and non-cancelable amounts that will be invoiced and recognized as revenue in future periods. RPO excludes contracts that are billed in arrears, such as certain time and materials contracts, as we apply the “right to invoice” practical expedient under relevant accounting guidance. Current remaining performance obligations (“cRPO”) represents RPO that will be recognized as revenue in the next 12 months.As of December 31, 2020, our RPO was $8.9 billion, of which 49% represented cRPO. Factors that may cause our RPO to vary from period to period include the following:•Foreign currency exchange rates. While a majority of our contracts have historically been in U.S. Dollars, an increasing percentage of our contracts in recent periods has been in foreign currencies, particularly the Euro and British Pound Sterling. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates as of the balance sheet date will cause variability in our RPO.•Mix of offerings. In a minority of cases, we allow our customers to host our software by themselves or through a third-party service provider. In self-hosted offerings, we recognize a portion of the revenue upfront upon the delivery of the software and as a result, such revenue is excluded from RPO. •Subscription start date. From time to time, we enter into contracts with a subscription start date in the future and these amounts are included in RPO if such contracts are signed by the balance sheet date. 32Table of Contents•Timing of contract renewals. While customers typically renew their contracts at the end of the contract term, from time to time, customers may do so either before or after the scheduled expiration date. For example, in cases where we are successful in selling additional products or services to an existing customer, a customer may decide to renew its existing contract early to ensure that all its contracts expire on the same date. In other cases, prolonged negotiations or other factors may result in a contract not being renewed until after it has expired. •Contract duration. While we typically enter into multi-year subscription services, the duration of our contracts varies. Further, we continue to see an increase in the number of 12-month agreements entered into with the U.S. Federal government throughout the year which has been the highest in the quarter ended September 30, driven primarily by timing of their annual budget expenditures. We sometimes also enter into contracts with durations that have a 12-month or shorter term to enable the contracts to co-terminate with the existing contract. The contract duration will cause variability in our RPO. Number of customers with ACV greater than $1 million. We count the total number of customers with annual contract value (“ACV”) greater than $1 million as of the end of the period. We had 1,093, 891, and 682 customers with ACV greater than $1 million as of December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. For purposes of customer count, a customer is defined as an entity that has a unique Dunn & Bradstreet Global Ultimate (“GULT”) Data Universal Numbering System (“DUNS”) number and an active subscription contract as of the measurement date. The DUNS number is a global standard for business identification and tracking. We make exceptions for holding companies, government entities and other organizations for which the GULT, in our judgment, does not accurately represent the ServiceNow customer. For example, while all U.S. government agencies roll up to “Government of the United States” under the GULT, we count each government agency that we contract with as a separate customer. Our customer count is subject to adjustments for acquisitions, spin-offs and other market activity; accordingly, we restate previously disclosed number of customers with ACV greater than $1 million calculations to allow for comparability. ACV is calculated based on the foreign exchange rate in effect at the time the contract was signed. Foreign exchange rate fluctuations could cause some variability in the number of customers with ACV greater than $1 million. We believe information regarding the total number of customers with ACV greater than $1 million provides useful information to investors because it is an indicator of our growing customer base and demonstrates the value customers are receiving from the Now Platform. Free cash flow. We define free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, as GAAP net cash provided by operating activities reduced by purchases of property and equipment. Purchases of property and equipment are otherwise included in cash used in investing activities under GAAP. We believe information regarding free cash flow provides useful information to investors because it is an indicator of the strength and performance of our business operations. However, our calculation of free cash flow may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies. A calculation of free cash flow is provided below: Year Ended December 31, 202020192018(in thousands)Free cash flow:Net cash provided by operating activities$1,786,599 $1,235,972 $811,089 Purchases of property and equipment(419,327)(264,892)(224,462)Free cash flow (1)$1,367,272 $971,080 $586,627 (1)Free cash flow for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2018 include the effect of $82 million and $145 million, respectively relating to the repayments of convertible senior notes attributable to debt discount. Refer to Note 11 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details.We have historically seen higher collections in the quarter ended March 31 due to seasonality in timing of entering into customer contracts which is significantly higher with new customers, as well as expansion with existing customers, in the quarter ended December 31. Additionally, we have historically seen higher disbursements in the quarters ended March 31 and September 30 due to payouts under our annual commission plans, purchases under our employee stock purchase plan and payouts under our bonus plans.33Table of ContentsRenewal rate. We calculate our renewal rate by subtracting our attrition rate from 100%. Our attrition rate for a period is equal to the ACV from customers lost during the period, divided by the sum of (i) the total ACV from all customers that renewed during the period, excluding changes in price or users, and (ii) the total ACV from all customers lost during the period. Accordingly, our renewal rate is calculated based on ACV and is not based on the number of customers that have renewed. Further, our renewal rate does not reflect increased or decreased purchases from our customers to the extent such customers are not lost customers or lapsed renewal. A lost customer is a customer that did not renew an expiring contract and that, in our judgment, will not be renewed. Typically, a customer that reduces its subscription upon renewal is not considered a lost customer. However, in instances where the subscription decrease represents the majority of the customer’s ACV, we may deem the renewal as a lost customer. For our renewal rate calculation, we define a customer as an entity with a separate production instance of our service and an active subscription contract as of the measurement date, instead of an entity with a unique GULT or DUNS number. We adjust our renewal rate for acquisitions, consolidations and other customer events that cause the merging of two or more accounts occurring at the time of renewal. Additionally, starting in 2020, we simplified our methodology related to contracts less than 12 months to derive ACV used to calculate renewal rate. Previously disclosed renewal rates may be restated to reflect such adjustments or methodology simplification to allow for comparability. While the previously disclosed renewal rates for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 were restated due to the methodology simplification to allow for comparability, there were no material changes to such previously disclosed renewal rates. Our renewal rate was 98% for each of the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. As our renewal rate is impacted by the timing of renewals, which could occur in advance of, or subsequent to the original contract end date, period-to-period comparison of renewal rates may not be meaningfulBillings. We define billings, a non-GAAP financial measure, as GAAP revenues recognized plus the change in total GAAP unbilled receivables, deferred revenue and customer deposits as presented on the consolidated statements of cash flows. The calculation of billings is provided below: Year Ended December 31, 202020192018(dollars in thousands)Billings:Total revenues$4,519,484 $3,460,437 $2,608,816 Change in deferred revenue, unbilled receivables and customer deposits(1) 709,522 541,776 480,019 Total billings$5,229,006 $4,002,213 $3,088,835 Year-over-year percentage change in total billings31 %30 %34 %(1)As presented on or derived from our consolidated statements of cash flows.Billings consists of amounts invoiced for subscription contracts with existing customers, renewal contracts, expansion contracts, contracts with new customers, and contracts for professional services and training. Factors that may cause our billings results to vary from period to period include the following:•Billings duration. While we typically bill customers annually in advance for our subscription services, customers sometimes request, and we accommodate, billings with durations less than or greater than the typical 12-month term. •Contract start date. From time to time, we enter into contracts with a contract start date in the future, and we exclude these amounts from billings as these amounts are not included in our consolidated balance sheets, unless such amounts have been paid as of the balance sheet date. •Foreign currency exchange rates. While a majority of our billings have historically been in U.S. Dollars, an increasing percentage of our billings in recent periods has been in foreign currencies, particularly the Euro and British Pound Sterling. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates will cause variability in our billings. Foreign currency rate fluctuations had a favorable impact of $21 million and $68 million on billings for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.•Timing of contract renewals. While customers typically renew their contracts at the end of the contract term, from time to time customers may do so either before or after the scheduled expiration date. For example, in cases where we are successful in selling additional products or services to an existing customer, a customer may decide to renew its existing contract early to ensure that all its contracts expire on the same date. In other cases, prolonged negotiations or other factors may result in a contract not being renewed until after it has expired.34Table of Contents•Seasonality. We have historically experienced seasonality in terms of when we enter into customer agreements for our services. We sign a significantly higher percentage of agreements with new customers, as well as expansion with existing customers, in the fourth quarter of each year. The increase in customer agreements for the fourth quarter is primarily a result of both large enterprise account buying patterns typical in the software industry, which are driven primarily by the expiration of annual authorized budgeted expenditures, and the terms of our commission plans which incentivize our direct sales organization to meet their annual quotas by December 31. Furthermore, we usually sign a significant portion of these agreements during the last month, and often the last two weeks, of each quarter. This seasonality in the timing of entering into customer contracts is sometimes not immediately apparent in our billings, due to the fact that we typically exclude cloud-offering contracts with a future start date from our billings, unless such amounts have been paid as of the balance sheet date. Similarly, this seasonality is reflected to a much lesser extent, and sometimes is not immediately apparent in our revenues, due to the fact that we recognize subscription revenues from our cloud offering contracts over the term of the subscription agreement, which is generally 12 to 36 months. Although these seasonal factors are common in the technology industry, historical patterns should not be considered a reliable indicator of our future sales activity or performance. Further, the seasonal factors could be heightened due to the impact of the current gross domestic product contraction and other impacts unknown at this time on our customers and sales cycles caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.While we believe billings is one indicator of the performance of our business, due to the factors described above, an increase or decrease in billings may not reflect the actual performance for that reporting period.To facilitate greater year-over-year comparability in our billings results, we disclose the impact that foreign currency rate fluctuations and fluctuations in billings duration had on our billings. The impact of foreign currency rate fluctuations is calculated by translating the current period results for entities reporting in currencies other than U.S. Dollars into U.S. Dollars at the exchange rates in effect during the prior period presented, rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the current period. The impact of fluctuations in billings duration is calculated by replacing the portion of multi-year billings in excess of 12 months during the current period with the portion of multi-year billings in excess of 12 months during the prior period presented. Notwithstanding the adjustments described above, the comparability of billings results from period to period remains subject to the impact of variations in the dollar value of contracts with future start dates and the timing of contract renewals, for which no adjustments have been presented.Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and EstimatesOur management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. These items are monitored and analyzed by us for changes in facts and circumstances, and material changes in these estimates could occur in the future. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Changes in estimates are reflected in reported results for the period in which they become known. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions and such differences could be material.While our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe that the following accounting policies are critical to the process of making significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our audited consolidated financial statements.Revenue RecognitionWe derive our revenues predominately from subscription revenues which are primarily comprised of subscription fees that give customers access to the ordered subscription service, related support and updates, if any, to the subscribed service during the subscription term. For our cloud services, we recognize subscription revenues ratably over the contract term beginning on the commencement date of each contract, the date we make our services available to our customers. Our contracts with customers typically include a fixed amount of consideration and are generally non-cancelable and without any refund-type provisions. 35Table of ContentsSubscription revenues also include revenues from self-hosted offerings in which customers deploy, or we grant customers the option to deploy without significant penalty, our subscription service internally or contract with a third party to host the software. For these contracts, we account for the software element separately from the related support and updates as they are distinct performance obligations. The transaction price is allocated to separate performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price (“SSP”) basis. The transaction price allocated to the software element is recognized when transfer of control of the software to the customer is complete. The transaction price allocated to the related support and updates are recognized ratably over the contract term. We enter into contracts that can include various combinations of products and services, which are generally capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations. For these contracts, the transaction price is allocated to the separate performance obligations on a relative SSP basis. Evaluating the terms and conditions included within our customer contracts for appropriate revenue recognition and determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment.Deferred Commissions Deferred commissions are the incremental selling costs that are associated with acquiring customer contracts and consist primarily of sales commissions paid to our sales organization and referral fees paid to independent third-parties. Commissions and referral fees earned upon the execution of initial and expansion contracts are primarily deferred and amortized over a period of benefit that we have determined to be five years. Commissions earned upon the renewal of customer contracts are deferred and amortized over the average renewal term. Additionally, for self-hosted offerings, consistent with the recognition of subscription revenues for self-hosted offerings, a portion of the commission cost is expensed upfront when the self-hosted offering is made available. Determining the period of benefit including average renewal term requires judgment for which we take into consideration our customer contracts, our technology life cycle and other factors. Business combinationsThe allocation of the purchase price in a business combination requires us to make significant estimates in determining the fair value of acquired assets and assumed liabilities, especially with respect to intangible assets. The excess of the purchase price in a business combination over the fair value of these tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. Critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, future expected cash flows, discount rates, the time and expense to recreate the assets and profit margin a market participant would receive. These estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates.Income Taxes Our annual tax rate is based on our income, statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective government taxing authorities. Significant judgment is required in determining our tax expense (benefit) and in evaluating our tax positions, including evaluating uncertainties and the complexity of taxes on foreign earnings. We review our tax positions quarterly and adjust the balances as new information becomes available. Deferred tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years. Such assets arise because of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. We evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deductions and credits by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including future growth, forecasted earnings, future taxable income, the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate, historical earnings, taxable income in prior years, if carryback is permitted under the law, carryforward periods and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. A valuation allowance is established if it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. To the extent sufficient positive evidence becomes available, we may release all or a portion of our valuation allowance in one or more future periods. A release of the valuation allowance, if any, would result in the recognition of certain deferred tax assets and a material income tax benefit for the period in which such release is recorded.36Table of ContentsDue to cumulative losses over recent years and based on all available positive and negative evidence, we have determined that it is more likely than not that our U.S. deferred tax assets will not be realizable as of December 31, 2020. We recognized an income tax benefit of $574 million due to the release of the valuation allowance on the Irish deferred tax assets for the year ended December 31, 2019. These Irish deferred tax assets were created primarily as a result of the difference between the tax basis in our Irish subsidiary and the cost reported in our consolidated financial statements resulting from the transfer of intangible assets to the Irish subsidiary as part of our foreign restructuring in 2018. Management applied significant judgment in assessing the positive and negative evidence available in the determination of the amount of deferred tax assets that were more likely than not to be realized in the future. In determining the need, or continued need, for a valuation allowance, we considered the weighting of the positive and negative evidence, which includes, among other things, emergence from a cumulative loss position over the previous three years during the fourth quarter of 2020, historical earnings, future growth, forecasted earnings, and future taxable income.Our tax positions are subject to income tax audits by multiple tax jurisdictions throughout the world. We recognize the tax benefit of an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not the position is sustainable upon examination by the taxing authority based on the technical merits. We measure the tax benefit recognized as the largest amount of benefit which is more likely than not to be realized upon settlement with the taxing authority. We recognize interest accrued and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in our tax provision. Significant judgment is required to evaluate uncertain tax positions. Our evaluations are based upon a number of factors, including changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law or guidance, correspondence with tax authorities during the course of audits and effective settlement of audit issues. Changes in the recognition or measurement of uncertain tax positions could result in material increases or decreases in our income tax expense in the period in which we make the change, which could have a material impact on our effective tax rate and operating results.We calculate the current and deferred income tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed in subsequent years and record adjustments based on filed income tax returns when identified. The amount of income taxes paid is subject to examination by U.S. federal, state and foreign tax authorities. The estimate of the potential outcome of any uncertain tax issue is subject to management’s assessment of relevant risks, facts and circumstances existing at that time. To the extent the assessment of such tax position changes, we record the change in estimate in the period in which we make the determination.New Accounting Pronouncements Pending AdoptionThe impact of recently issued accounting standards is set forth in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Components of Results of Operations RevenuesSubscription revenues. Subscription revenues are primarily comprised of fees that give customers access to the ordered subscription service for both self-hosted offerings and cloud-based subscription offerings, and related standard and enhanced support and updates, if any, to the subscription service during the subscription term. For our cloud-based offerings, we recognize revenue ratably over the subscription term. For self-hosted offerings, a substantial portion of the sales price is recognized upon delivery of the software, which may cause greater variability in our subscription revenues and subscription gross margin. Pricing includes multiple instances, hosting and support services, data backup and disaster recovery services, as well as future updates, when and if available, offered during the subscription term. We typically invoice our customers for subscription fees in annual increments upon execution of the initial contract or subsequent renewal. Our contracts are generally non-cancelable during the subscription term, though a customer can terminate for breach if we materially fail to perform. Professional services and other revenues. Our arrangements for professional services are primarily on a time-and-materials basis, and we generally invoice our customers monthly in arrears for the professional services based on actual hours and expenses incurred. Some of our professional services arrangements are on a fixed fee or subscription basis. Professional services revenues are recognized as services are delivered. Other revenues primarily consist of fees from customer training delivered on-site or through publicly available classes. Typical payment terms require our customers to pay us within 30 days of invoice. 37Table of ContentsWe sell our subscription services primarily through our direct sales organization. We also sell services through managed service providers and resale partners. We also generate revenues from certain professional services and from training of customers and partner personnel, through both our direct team and indirect channel sales. Revenues from our direct sales organization represented 81%, 82% and 84% of our total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. For purposes of calculating revenues from our direct sales organization, revenues from systems integrators and managed services providers are included as part of the direct sales organization. Cost of RevenuesCost of subscription revenues. Cost of subscription revenues consists primarily of expenses related to hosting our services and providing support to our customers. These expenses are comprised of data center capacity costs, which include colocation costs associated with our data centers as well as interconnectivity between data centers, depreciation related to our infrastructure hardware equipment dedicated for customer use, amortization of intangible assets, expenses associated with software, IT services and dedicated customer support, personnel-related costs directly associated with data center operations and customer support, including salaries, benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation and allocated overhead.Cost of professional services and other revenues. Cost of professional services and other revenues consists primarily of personnel-related costs directly associated with our professional services and training departments, including salaries, benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation, the costs of contracted third-party partners, travel expenses and allocated overhead.Professional services are performed directly by our services team, as well as by contracted third-party partners. Fees paid by us to third-party partners are primarily recognized as cost of revenues as the professional services are delivered. Cost of revenues associated with our professional services engagements contracted with third-party partners as a percentage of professional services and other revenues was 10%, 15% and 18% for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.Sales and MarketingSales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel-related expenses directly associated with our sales and marketing staff, including salaries, benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation. Sales and marketing expenses also include the amortization of commissions paid to our sales employees, including related payroll taxes and fringe benefits. From time to time, third parties provide us referrals for which we pay a referral fee. We include revenues associated with these referrals as part of revenues from our direct sales organization. Referral fees paid to these third parties are generally 10% of the customer’s net new ACV. We defer referral fees paid as they are considered incremental selling costs associated with acquiring customer contracts, and include the amortization of these referral fees in sales and marketing expense. In addition, sales and marketing expenses include branding expenses, expenses offset by proceeds related to Knowledge, other marketing program expenses, which include events other than Knowledge, and costs associated with purchasing advertising and marketing data, software and subscription services dedicated for sales and marketing use and allocated overhead.Research and DevelopmentResearch and development expenses consist primarily of personnel-related expenses directly associated with our research and development staff, including salaries, benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation and allocated overhead. Research and development expenses also include data center capacity costs, costs associated with outside services contracted for research and development purposes and depreciation of infrastructure hardware equipment that is used solely for research and development purposes. General and AdministrativeGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel-related expenses for our executive, finance, legal, human resources, facilities and administrative personnel, including salaries, benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation, external legal, accounting and other professional services fees, other corporate expenses, amortization of intangible assets and allocated overhead.38Table of ContentsProvision for Income TaxesProvision for income taxes consists of federal, state and foreign income taxes. Due to cumulative losses, we maintain a valuation allowance against our U.S. deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. We consider all available evidence, both positive and negative, including but not limited to earnings history, projected future outcomes, industry and market trends and the nature of each of the deferred tax assets in assessing the extent to which a valuation allowance should be applied against our U.S. and foreign deferred tax assets.

Included in subscription revenues is $205 million and $164 million of revenues recognized upfront from the delivery of software associated with self-hosted offerings during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We expect subscription revenues for the year ending December 31, 2021 to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to add new customers and existing customers increase their usage of our products, but remain relatively flat as a percentage of revenue compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. We continue to monitor the COVID-19 pandemic in 2021 and its impact on customer acquisition and renewal rates.Our expectations for revenues, cost of revenues and operating expenses for the year ending December 31, 2021 are based on foreign exchange rates as of December 31, 2020.Subscription revenues consist of the following:Year Ended December 31,% Change20202019(dollars in thousands)Digital workflow products$3,749,118 $2,810,887 33 %ITOM products536,679 444,192 21 %Total subscription revenues$4,285,797 $3,255,079 32 %Our digital workflow products include the Now Platform, IT Service Management, IT Business Management, DevOps, IT Asset Management, Security Operations, Governance, Risk and Compliance, HR Service Delivery, Safe Workplace Suite of applications, Workplace Service Delivery, Legal Service Delivery, Customer Service Management, Field Service Management, Connected Operations, App Engine and IntegrationHub, and are generally priced on a per user basis. Our ITOM products are generally priced on a per node (physical or virtual server) basis. In previously issued consolidated financial statements, we referred to digital workflow products as “service management products.” 39Table of ContentsProfessional services and other revenues increased by $28 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the prior year, due to an increase in services and trainings provided to new and existing customers. We expect professional services and other revenues for the year ending December 31, 2021 to increase in absolute dollars, but remain relatively flat as a percentage of revenue compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. We are increasingly focused on deploying our internal professional services organization as a strategic resource and relying on our partner ecosystem to contract directly with customers for implementation services delivery.

Personnel-related costs including stock-based compensation and overhead expenses increased by $80 million and depreciation expense related to data center hardware and software and maintenance costs to support the expansion of our data center capacity increased by $88 million as compared to the prior year. In addition, amortization of intangibles increased by $12 million as a result of acquisitions. We expect our cost of subscription revenues for the year ending December 31, 2021 to increase in absolute dollars as we provide subscription services to more customers and increase usage within our customer instances. Our subscription gross profit percentage was 83% for each of the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. We expect our subscription gross profit percentage to slightly decrease for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. To the extent future acquisitions are consummated, our cost of subscription revenues may increase due to additional non-cash charges associated with the amortization of intangible assets acquired.Cost of professional services and other revenues increased by $9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the prior year, primarily due to increased headcount resulting in increase of personnel-related costs including stock-based compensation offset by a decrease in third-party implementation costs as we continue to invest and deploy our internal professional service organization to increase their utilization and a reduction in travel expenses resulting from travel restrictions due to the COVID-19 pandemic.Our professional services and other gross loss percentage decreased to 10% for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 20% in the prior year, primarily driven by the increased utilization of our internal professional services organization and the reduction in certain travel expenses. We expect our professional services and other gross loss percentage to increase for the year ending December 31, 2021 as we expect utilization of our internal professional services organization to stabilize resulting in additional support cost for the business growth and increases in travel expenses compared to the year ended December 31, 2020.40Table of ContentsSales and Marketing Year Ended December 31,% Change 20202019 (dollars in thousands) Sales and marketing$1,855,016 $1,534,284 21 %Percentage of revenues41 %44 %Sales and marketing expenses increased by $321 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the prior year. The increase was primarily due to increased headcount, resulting in an increase in personnel-related costs including stock-based compensation and overhead expenses of $255 million, compared to the prior year. Amortization of deferred commissions and third-party referral fees increased by $51 million, compared to the prior year, due to an increase in contracts with new customers, expansion and renewal contracts. Other sales and marketing program expenses, which include branding, purchase of advertising and market data and outside services, increased by $73 million compared to the prior year. Amid the ongoing regulatory restrictions imposed by governments worldwide in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we temporarily closed most of our offices to ensure the well-being and safety of our global employees, office staff and communities, and encouraged our employees to work remotely and limit travel. Further, in response to the pandemic, we canceled Knowledge and other in-person events and either replaced them with digital events or postponed them to future periods and implemented travel restrictions which resulted in a decrease of $66 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to prior year.Despite the uncertainty around the continued impact of COVID-19 and its duration, we expect sales and marketing expenses for the year ending December 31, 2021 to increase in absolute dollars, but remain relatively flat as a percentage of revenue compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, as we continue to expand our direct sales organization, increase our marketing activities, grow our international operations and build brand awareness.Research and Development Year Ended December 31,% Change 20202019 (dollars in thousands) Research and development$1,024,327 $748,369 37 %Percentage of revenues23 %22 %Research and development expenses increased by $276 million during the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the prior year.

The remaining increase was primarily due to increase in hosting costs and data center related depreciation costs to support research and development activities. We expect research and development expenses for the year ending December 31, 2021 to increase in absolute dollars, but remain relatively flat as a percentage of revenue compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, as we continue to improve the existing functionality of our services, develop new applications to fill market needs and enhance our core platform.41Table of ContentsGeneral and Administrative Year Ended December 31,% Change 20202019 (dollars in thousands) General and administrative$454,165 $339,016 34 %Percentage of revenues10 %10 %General and administrative expenses increased by $115 million during the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the prior year.

Stock-based compensation is inherently difficult to forecast due to fluctuations in our stock price. Based upon our stock price as of December 31, 2020, we expect stock-based compensation to continue to increase in absolute dollars for the year ending December 31, 2021 as we continue to issue stock-based awards to our employees, but remain relatively flat as a percentage of revenue compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 but we expect this to decline over time as we continue to grow.Foreign Currency ExchangeOur international operations have provided and will continue to provide a significant portion of our total revenues. Revenues outside North America represented 35% and 34% of total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Because we primarily transact in foreign currencies for sales outside of the United States, the general weakening of the U.S. Dollar relative to other major foreign currencies (primarily the Euro and British Pound Sterling) during the year ended December 31, 2020 had a favorable impact on our revenues. For entities reporting in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar, if we had translated our results for the year ended December 31, 2020 at the exchange rates in effect for the year ended December 31, 2019 rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the period, our reported subscription revenues would have been $14 million lower. The impact from the foreign currency movements was not material for professional services and other revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020.42Table of ContentsIn addition, because we primarily transact in foreign currencies for cost of revenues and operating expenses outside of the United States, the general weakening of the U.S. Dollar relative to other major foreign currencies during the year ended December 31, 2020, for the most part, had an unfavorable impact but overall, did not have a material impact if we had translated our results for the year ended December 31, 2020 at the average exchange rates in effect for the year ended December 31, 2019 rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the period. Interest ExpenseYear Ended December 31,% Change20202019(dollars in thousands)Interest expense$(32,746)$(33,283)(2 %)Percentage of revenues(1 %)(1 %)Interest expense slightly decreased during the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the prior year, due to the decrease in amortization expense of debt discount and issuance costs as a result of the 2022 Notes Repurchase offset by increase in debt discount, issuance cost and interest related to 2030 Notes. For the year ending December 31, 2021, we expect to incur approximately $30 million related to the 2030 Notes and 2022 Notes.Other Income (Expense), net Year Ended December 31,% Change 20202019 (dollars in thousands) Interest income$39,483 $55,409 (29)%Foreign currency exchange loss, net of derivative contracts(14,076)(594)NMLoss on extinguishment of 2022 Notes(46,614)— NMOther4,275 3,530 21 %Other income (expense), net$(16,932)$58,345 (129)%NM - Not meaningful.Other income (expense), net decreased by $75 million during the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the prior year, primarily driven by loss on extinguishment resulting from the 2022 Notes Repurchase and the early conversions of $47 million and increase in foreign currency exchange loss, net of derivative contracts of $13 million compared to the prior year. Additionally, interest income decreased compared to the same period in the prior year despite an increase in investments primarily due to the decline in interest rates during the year and change in our investment strategy to higher quality bonds in response to the global market disruptions and uncertainties resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic.To mitigate our risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, we enter into foreign currency derivative contracts with maturities of 12 months or less to hedge a portion of our net outstanding monetary assets and liabilities. These hedging contracts may reduce, but cannot entirely eliminate, the impact of adverse currency exchange rate movements. 43Table of ContentsProvision for (benefit from) Income Taxes Year Ended December 31,% Change 20202019 (dollars in thousands) Income before income taxes$149,185 $67,185 122 %Provision for (benefit from) income taxes30,682 (559,513)(105 %)Effective tax rate21 %(833)%(103)% Our effective tax rate was 21% for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to (833)% for the prior year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to the release of the valuation allowance on the Irish deferred tax assets of $574 million in the year ended December 31, 2019. The income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily attributable to the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates, the valuation allowance in the U.S. and the intercompany sale of certain intellectual property rights. See Note 17 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for our reconciliation of income taxes at the statutory federal rate to the provision for income taxes.We maintained a full valuation allowance on our U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The significant components of the tax expense recorded are current cash taxes payable in various jurisdictions. The cash tax expenses are impacted by each jurisdiction’s individual tax rates, laws on timing of recognition of income and deductions, and availability of net operating losses and tax credits. Given the full valuation allowance on our U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets, sensitivity of current cash taxes to local rules and our foreign structuring, we expect that our effective tax rate could fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis and could be adversely affected to the extent earnings are lower than anticipated in countries that have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher statutory rates. To the extent sufficient positive evidence becomes available, we may release all or a portion of our valuation allowance in one or more future periods. A release of the valuation allowance, if any, would result in the recognition of certain deferred tax assets and a material income tax benefit for the period in which such release is recorded.Quarterly Results of Operations The following table sets forth our selected unaudited quarterly consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). We have prepared the quarterly data on a consistent basis with the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In the opinion of management, the financial information reflects all necessary adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair statement of this data. This information should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The results of historical periods are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for a full year or any future period.For the Three Months Ended December 31, 2020September 30, 2020June 30, 2020March 31, 2020December 31, 2019September 30, 2019June 30, 2019March 31, 2019(in thousands, except per share data)Total revenues$1,250,330 $1,151,972 $1,070,842 $1,046,340 $951,774 $885,833 $833,904 $788,926 Gross profit$971,226 $900,268 $837,903 $822,974 $740,321 $685,040 $635,757 $602,674 Net income (loss)(1)$16,648 $12,858 $40,766 $48,231 $598,724 $40,598 $(11,079)$(1,545)Net income (loss) per share - basic(1)$0.09 $0.07 $0.21 $0.25 $3.17 $0.22 $(0.06)$(0.01)Net income (loss) per share - diluted(1)$0.08 $0.06 $0.20 $0.24 $3.03 $0.21 $(0.06)$(0.01)Weighted-average shares used to compute net income (loss) per share - basic195,461 193,237 191,319 190,163 189,042 188,074 186,678 182,062 Weighted-average shares used to compute net income (loss) per share - diluted202,455 201,861 201,453 199,938 197,843 197,878 186,678 182,062 44Table of Contents(1)The amounts for the three months ended December 31, 2019 reflect the impact of an income tax benefit of $574 million from the release of the valuation allowance on the Irish deferred tax assets. Refer to Note 17 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details.Our revenues have increased over the periods presented due to increased sales to new and existing customers. Our operating expenses have increased over the periods presented due to increases in headcount, data center operations and other related expenses to support our growth. We have historically seen an increase in marketing expenses in the quarter ended June 30, and a corresponding decrease in marketing expenses in the quarter ended September 30 due to the expenses incurred for our annual Knowledge user conference, partially offset by related proceeds. Marketing expenses in the quarter ended December 31 are also historically higher due to user forums we generally conduct in that quarter. However, during the year ended December 31, 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we took several measures to ensure the well-being and safety of our employees including reduction of travel and cancellation of live events to be replaced with digital events. Accordingly, timing and amount of marketing expense might not be consistent with historical trends prior to COVID-19. Nonetheless, we still anticipate operating expenses will continue to increase in future periods as we continue to focus on investing in the long-term growth of our business. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents, investments, and cash generated from operations. As of December 31, 2020, we had $3 billion in cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, of which $450 million represented cash held by foreign subsidiaries and $417 million is denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. In addition, we had $1 billion in long-term investments that provide additional capital resources. We do not anticipate that we will need funds generated from foreign operations to fund our domestic operations.In August 2020, we issued 1.40% fixed rate ten-year notes with an aggregate principal amount of $1.5 billion due on September 1, 2030 (the “2030 Notes”). The 2030 Notes were issued at 99.63% of principal and we incurred approximately $13 million for debt issuance costs. Interest is payable semi-annually in arrears on March 1 and September 1 of each year, beginning on March 1, 2021, and the entire outstanding principal amount is due at maturity on September 1, 2030. The 2030 Notes are unsecured obligations and the indentures governing the 2030 Notes contain customary events of default and customary covenants that, among others and subject to exceptions, restrict the Company’s ability to incur or guarantee debt secured by liens on specified assets or enter into sale and lease-back transactions with respect to specified properties. In May and June 2017, we issued the 2022 Notes with an aggregate principal amount of $782.5 million. In connection with the issuance of the 2022 Notes, we entered into the 2022 Note Hedge transactions and 2022 Warrants transactions with certain financial institutions. The price of our common stock was greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price of the 2022 Notes for at least 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the quarters ended June 30, 2018 through December 31, 2020, except for the quarter ended December 31, 2018. Therefore, our 2022 Notes became convertible at the holders’ option beginning on July 1, 2018 and continue to be convertible through March 31, 2021, except for the quarter ended March 31, 2019 because the Conversion Condition for the 2022 Notes was not met for the quarter ended December 31, 2018. The impact of the 2022 Notes on our liquidity will depend on the settlement method we elect. We currently intend to settle the principal amount of any converted 2022 Notes in cash. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we paid cash to settle $116 million in principal of the 2022 Notes. Additionally, we repurchased $497 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2022 Notes (the “2022 Notes Repurchase”) which was accounted for as a debt extinguishment. We used proceeds from the partial unwind of the 2022 Note Hedge of $1.1 billion for the 2022 Notes Repurchase.Based on conversion requests received through the filing date, we expect to settle in cash an aggregate of approximately $34 million in principal amount of the 2022 Notes during the first quarter of 2021. We may receive additional conversion requests that require settlement after the first quarter of 2021.During the year ended December 31, 2020, we issued 2.3 million shares of our common stock upon partial unwind of the 2022 Warrants. We expect to issue additional shares of our common stock in the second half of 2022 upon the automatic exercise of the remaining portion of the 2022 Warrants. As the remaining portion of the 2022 Warrants will be net share settled, there will be no impact on our liquidity. The total number of shares of our common stock we will issue depends on the daily volume-weighted average stock prices over a 60 trading day period beginning on the first expiration date of the remaining portion of the 2022 Warrants, which will be September 1, 2022. In addition, we issued 4.3 million shares of our common stock upon the automatic exercise of a portion of the 2018 Warrants during the year ended December 31, 2019. The 2018 Warrants were no longer outstanding as of June 30, 2019. Refer to Note 11 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.45Table of ContentsCash from operations could be affected by various risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and other risks detailed in Part I, Item 1A titled “Risk Factors”. However, we anticipate our current cash, cash equivalents and investments balance and anticipated cash flows generated from operations based on our current business plan and revenue prospects will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs, including the repayment of any early conversions of our 2022 Notes, debt service costs, expansion of data centers, lease obligations, expenditures related to the growth of our headcount and the acquisition of property and equipment, intangibles, and investments in office facilities, to accommodate our operations for at least the next 12 months. Whether these resources are adequate to meet our liquidity needs beyond that period will depend on our growth, operating results, cash utilized for acquisitions and/or debt retirements if any are consummated, and the capital expenditures required to meet possible increased demand for our services. If we require additional capital resources to grow our business or repay our 2022 Notes at any time in the future, we may seek to finance our operations from the current funds available or seek additional equity or debt financing.

The net increase in operating cash flow was primarily due to an increase in adjustments for non-cash items to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operations, driven by stock-based compensation, depreciation and amortization from increased capital expenditures and deferred commissions and the overall favorable impact from changes in operating assets and liabilities offset by the repayment of 2022 Notes attributable to debt discount. Investing ActivitiesNet cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $1.5 billion compared to $724 million for the prior year. The increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to $566 million increase in net purchases of investments, $154 million increase in capital expenditures related to infrastructure hardware equipment as well as office related expenditures to support our headcount growth and $40 million, net increase in business combinations, net of cash and restricted cash acquired, and purchases of intangibles. Financing Activities Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $597 million compared to net cash used in financing activities of $302 million for the prior year due to proceeds of $1.5 billion from the issuance of the 2030 Notes, net of discount and issuance costs, offset by the 2022 Notes Repurchase of $1.6 billion attributable to principal, funded in part by the proceeds received from the partial unwind of the 2022 Note Hedge of $1.1 billion. In addition, an increase in proceeds from employee equity plans by $38 million was offset by a $99 million increase in taxes paid related to net share settlement of equity awards.46Table of ContentsContractual Obligations and CommitmentsThe following table represents our future non-cancelable contractual obligations as of December 31, 2020, aggregated by type: Payments Due by PeriodTotalLessThan1 Year1 – 3Years3 – 5YearsMoreThan5 Years (in thousands)Operating leases, including imputed interest (1)$582,907 $87,832 $166,034 $116,029 $213,012 Purchase obligations (2)283,230 119,990 122,301 36,938 4,001 Principal amount payable on our long-term debt(3)1,669,224 — $169,224 — 1,500,000 Total contractual obligations$2,535,361 $207,822 $457,559 $152,967 $1,717,013 (1)Consists of future non-cancelable minimum rental payments under operating leases for offices and data centers.(2)Consists of future minimum payments under non-cancelable purchase commitments related to our daily business operations. Not included in the table above are certain purchase commitments related to our future annual Knowledge user conferences and other customer or sales conferences to be held in 2021 and future years. If we were to cancel these contractual commitments as of December 31, 2020, we would have been obligated to pay cancellation penalties of approximately $36 million in aggregate.(3)For additional information regarding our long-term debt, refer to Note 11 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.In addition to the obligations in the table above, $20 million of unrecognized tax benefits have been recorded as liabilities as of December 31, 2020. It is uncertain if or when such amounts may be settled. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements During all periods presented, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for purposes of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. As such, we are not exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in those types of relationships.ITEM 7A.QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKForeign Currency Exchange RiskWe have foreign currency risks related to our revenue and operating expenses denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar, primarily the Euro and British Pound Sterling. We are a net receiver of Euro and British Pound Sterling, and therefore benefit from a weakening of the U.S. Dollar relative to these currencies and, conversely, are adversely affected by a strengthening of the U.S. Dollar relative to these currencies. Revenues denominated in U.S. Dollar as a percentage of total revenues was 71% during each of the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. To mitigate our risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, we enter into foreign currency derivative contracts to hedge a portion of our net outstanding monetary assets and liabilities. These derivative contracts are intended to offset gains or losses related to remeasuring monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entities in which they are recorded.A hypothetical 10% increase in the U.S. Dollar against other currencies would have resulted in a decrease in operating income of $47 million and $31 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and an increase in operating loss of $23 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This analysis disregards the possibilities that rates can move in opposite directions and that losses from one geographic area may be offset by gains from another geographic area.47These derivative contracts expose us to credit risk to the extent that the counterparties may be unable to meet the terms of the arrangement. We mitigate this credit risk by transacting with major financial institutions with high credit ratings and entering into master netting arrangements, which permit net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty. While the contract or notional amount is often used to express the volume of foreign currency derivative contracts, the amounts potentially subject to credit risk are generally limited to the amounts, if any, by which the counterparties’ obligations under the agreements exceed our obligations to the counterparties. We are not required to pledge, and are not entitled to receive, cash collateral related to these derivative instruments. We do not enter into derivative contracts for trading or speculative purposes. Refer to Note 8 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. Interest Rate Sensitivity We had an aggregate of $4.6 billion in cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and long-term investments as of December 31, 2020. This amount was invested primarily in money market funds, certificates of deposit, corporate notes and bonds, government and agency securities and other debt securities with a minimum rating of BBB by Standard & Poor’s, Baa2 by Moody’s, or BBB by Fitch. The primary objectives of our investment activities are the preservation of capital and support of our liquidity requirements. Our investments are exposed to market risk due to fluctuations in interest rates, which may affect our interest income and the fair market value of our investments. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would have resulted in an approximate $29 million decline of the fair value of our available-for-sale securities. This estimate is based on a sensitivity model that measures market value changes when changes in interest rates occur.As of December 31, 2019, we had an aggregate of $2.7 billion in cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and long-term investments, and a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would have resulted in an approximate $14 million decline of the fair value of our available-for-sale securities. Market RiskIn August 2020, we issued 1.40% fixed rate ten-year notes with an aggregate principal amount of $1.5 billion due on September 1, 2030 (the “2030 Notes”). The 2030 Notes were issued at 99.63% of principal and we incurred approximately $13 million for debt issuance costs. Interest is payable semi-annually in arrears on March 1 and September 1 of each year, beginning on March 1, 2021, and the entire outstanding principal amount is due at maturity on September 1, 2030. The 2030 Notes are unsecured obligations and the indentures governing the 2030 Notes contain customary events of default and covenants that, among others and subject to exceptions, restrict the Company’s ability to incur or guarantee debt secured by liens on specified assets or enter into sale and lease-back transactions with respect to specified properties. In May and June 2017, we issued the 2022 Notes with an aggregate principal amount of $782.5 million. We carry these instruments at face value less unamortized discount on our consolidated balance sheet. Because these instruments do not bear interest, we have no economic interest rate exposure on our 2022 Notes associated with changes in interest rates. However, the fair value of our 2022 Notes is exposed to interest rate risks. Generally, the fair market value of our 2022 Notes will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. In addition, the fair value of the 2022 Notes is affected by our stock price due to the conversion feature, and will generally increase as the stock price increases.We hold cash balances with multiple financial institutions in various countries and these balances routinely exceed deposit insurance limits.As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had $28 million and $22 million, respectively, of equity investments in privately-held companies that are in the development stage. The fair value of these strategic investments may fluctuate depending on the financial condition and near-term prospects of these companies, and we may be required to record an impairment charge if the carrying value of these investments exceed their fair value. We are required to measure equity securities at fair value with changes in fair value recognized through our consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). As a result, we anticipate additional volatility to our consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) in future periods, due to the valuation and timing of observable price changes of our investments in privately held securities. These changes could be material based on market conditions and events.48",2023-12-30 18:26:37.174916

A discussion of our financial condition and results of operations for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 and year-to-year comparisons between fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 that is not included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K can be found in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, filed on February 12, 2021.Our free cash flow and billings measures included in the sections entitled “—Key Business Metrics—Free Cash Flow” and “—Key Business Metrics—Billings” are not in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures are not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. These measures may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, limiting their usefulness for comparison purposes. We encourage investors to carefully consider our results under GAAP, as well as our supplemental non-GAAP results, to more fully understand our business.Overview ServiceNow was founded on a simple premise: a better technology platform will help work flow better. The company’s purpose is to make the world work better for everyone. We help global enterprises across industries, universities and governments to digitize their workflows. The Now Platform enables us to connect systems, silos, departments and processes with digital workflows that are simple and easy to use. We categorize the workflows we provide into four primary areas: IT, Employee, Customer and Creator. The products under each of our workflows are helping customers connect work across systems and silos to enable great experiences for people. The Now Platform is uniquely positioned to enable our customers’ digital transformation from non-integrated enterprise technology solutions with manual and disconnected processes and activities, to integrated enterprise technology solutions with automation and connected processes and activities. The transformation to digital operations, enabled by the Now Platform, increases our customers’ resiliency and security and delivers great experiences and additional value to their employees and consumers. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we continue to focus on maintaining business continuity, helping our employees, customers and communities, and preparing for the future and the long-term success of our business. We are continuing to monitor the actual and potential effects of the COVID-19 pandemic across our business. The extent and continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business will depend on certain developments including the duration and spread of the outbreak and new variant strains of the virus; the availability and distribution of effective vaccines; the severity of the economic decline attributable to the pandemic and timing, nature and sustainability of economic recovery; and government responses, including vaccination or testing mandates, all of which are highly uncertain and unpredictable. Starting late 2021, many employees began to return to our offices for at least part of the week. Our return to work approach may vary among geographies depending on appropriate health protocols, and may change at any time depending on the severity of or spikes in COVID-19. The impact, if any, of these and any additional operational changes we may implement is uncertain but changes we have implemented have not affected and are not expected to affect our ability to maintain operations, including financial reporting systems, internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. See the section “Risk Factors” in Part 1, Item 1A of this Annual Report for further discussion of the possible impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business.Key Business MetricsRemaining performance obligations. Transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations (“RPO”) represents contracted revenue that has not yet been recognized, which includes deferred revenue and non-cancelable amounts that will be invoiced and recognized as revenue in future periods. RPO excludes contracts that are billed in arrears, such as certain time and materials contracts, as we apply the “right to invoice” practical expedient under relevant accounting guidance. Current remaining performance obligations (“cRPO”) represents RPO that will be recognized as revenue in the next 12 months.33Table of ContentsAs of December 31, 2021, our RPO was $11.5 billion, of which 49% represented cRPO. RPO and cRPO increased by 29%, respectively, compared to December 31, 2020. Factors that may cause our RPO to vary from period to period include the following:•Foreign currency exchange rates. While a majority of our contracts have historically been in U.S. Dollars, an increasing percentage of our contracts in recent periods has been in foreign currencies, particularly the Euro and British Pound Sterling. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates as of the balance sheet date will cause variability in our RPO.•Mix of offerings. In a minority of cases, we allow our customers to host our software by themselves or through a third-party service provider. In self-hosted offerings, we recognize a portion of the revenue upfront upon the delivery of the software and as a result, such revenue is excluded from RPO. •Subscription start date. From time to time, we enter into contracts with a subscription start date in the future and these amounts are included in RPO if such contracts are signed by the balance sheet date. •Timing of contract renewals. While customers typically renew their contracts at the end of the contract term, from time to time, customers may do so either before or after the scheduled expiration date. For example, in cases where we are successful in selling additional products or services to an existing customer, a customer may decide to renew its existing contract early to ensure that all its contracts expire on the same date. In other cases, prolonged negotiations or other factors may result in a contract not being renewed until after it has expired. •Contract duration. While we typically enter into multi-year subscription services, the duration of our contracts varies. Further, we continue to see an increase in the number of 12-month agreements entered into with the U.S. Federal government throughout the year, with the highest number of agreements entered into in the quarter ended September 30, driven primarily by timing of their annual budget expenditures. We sometimes also enter into contracts with durations that have a 12-month or shorter term to enable the contracts to co-terminate with the existing contract. The contract duration will cause variability in our RPO. Number of customers with ACV greater than $1 million. We count the total number of customers with annual contract value (“ACV”) greater than $1 million as of the end of the period. We had 1,359, 1,085, and 882 customers with ACV greater than $1 million as of December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. For purposes of customer count, a customer is defined as an entity that has a unique Dunn & Bradstreet Global Ultimate (“GULT”) Data Universal Numbering System (“DUNS”) number and an active subscription contract as of the measurement date. The DUNS number is a global standard for business identification and tracking. We make exceptions for holding companies, government entities and other organizations for which the GULT, in our judgment, does not accurately represent the ServiceNow customer. For example, while all U.S. government agencies roll up to “Government of the United States” under the GULT, we count each government agency that we contract with as a separate customer. Our customer count is subject to adjustments for acquisitions, spin-offs and other market activity; accordingly, we restate previously disclosed number of customers with ACV greater than $1 million calculations to allow for comparability. ACV is calculated based on the foreign exchange rate in effect at the time the contract was signed. Foreign exchange rate fluctuations could cause some variability in the number of customers with ACV greater than $1 million. We believe information regarding the total number of customers with ACV greater than $1 million provides useful information to investors because it is an indicator of our growing customer base and demonstrates the value customers are receiving from the Now Platform. Free cash flow. We define free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, as GAAP net cash provided by operating activities reduced by purchases of property and equipment. Purchases of property and equipment are otherwise included in cash used in investing activities under GAAP. We believe information regarding free cash flow provides useful information to investors because it is an indicator of the strength and performance of our business operations. However, our calculation of free cash flow may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies. A calculation of free cash flow is provided below:34Table of Contents Year Ended December 31, 202120202019(in millions)Free cash flow:Net cash provided by operating activities$2,191 $1,786 $1,236 Purchases of property and equipment(392)(419)(265)Free cash flow (1)$1,799 $1,367 $971 (1)Free cash flow for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 include the effect of $15 million and $82 million, respectively relating to the repayments of convertible senior notes attributable to debt discount. Refer to Note 11 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details.We have historically seen higher collections in the quarter ended March 31 due to seasonality in timing of entering into customer contracts which is significantly higher in the quarter ended December 31. Additionally, we have historically seen higher disbursements in the quarters ended March 31 and September 30 due to payouts under our annual commission plans, purchases under our employee stock purchase plan, payouts under our bonus plans and coupon payments related to our 2030 Notes beginning in 2021.Renewal rate. We calculate our renewal rate by subtracting our attrition rate from 100%. Our attrition rate for a period is equal to the ACV from customers lost during the period, divided by the sum of (i) the total ACV from all customers that renewed during the period, excluding changes in price or users, and (ii) the total ACV from all customers lost during the period. Accordingly, our renewal rate is calculated based on ACV and is not based on the number of customers that have renewed. Further, our renewal rate does not reflect increased or decreased purchases from our customers to the extent such customers are not lost customers or lapsed renewal. A lost customer is a customer that did not renew an expiring contract and that, in our judgment, will not be renewed. Typically, a customer that reduces its subscription upon renewal is not considered a lost customer. However, in instances where the subscription decrease represents the majority of the customer’s ACV, we may deem the renewal as a lost customer. For our renewal rate calculation, we define a customer as an entity with a separate production instance of our service and an active subscription contract as of the measurement date, instead of an entity with a unique GULT or DUNS number. We adjust our renewal rate for acquisitions, consolidations and other customer events that cause the merging of two or more accounts occurring at the time of renewal. Additionally, starting in 2020, we simplified our methodology related to contracts less than 12 months to derive ACV used to calculate renewal rate. Previously disclosed renewal rates may be restated to reflect such adjustments or methodology simplification to allow for comparability. However, there were no material changes to such previously disclosed renewal rates. Our renewal rate was 98% for each of the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019. As our renewal rate is impacted by the timing of renewals, which could occur in advance of, or subsequent to the original contract end date, period-to-period comparison of renewal rates may not be meaningful.Billings. We define billings, a non-GAAP financial measure, as GAAP revenues recognized plus the change in total GAAP unbilled receivables, deferred revenue and customer deposits as presented on the consolidated statements of cash flows. The calculation of billings is provided below: Year Ended December 31, 202120202019(dollars in millions)Billings:Total revenues$5,896 $4,519 $3,460 Change in deferred revenue, unbilled receivables and customer deposits(1) 954 710 542 Total billings$6,850 $5,229 $4,002 Year-over-year percentage change in total billings31 %31 %30 %(1)As presented on or derived from our consolidated statements of cash flows.35Table of ContentsBillings consists of amounts invoiced for subscription contracts with existing customers, renewal contracts, expansion contracts, contracts with new customers, and contracts for professional services and training. Factors that may cause our billings results to vary from period to period include the following:•Billings duration. While we typically bill customers annually in advance for our subscription services, customers sometimes request, and we accommodate, billings with durations less than or greater than the typical 12-month term. Changes in billings duration had a favorable impact of $38 million and an immaterial impact on billings for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. •Contract start date. From time to time, we enter into contracts with a contract start date in the future, and we exclude these amounts from billings as these amounts are not included in our consolidated balance sheets, unless such amounts have been paid as of the balance sheet date. •Foreign currency exchange rates. While a majority of our billings have historically been in U.S. Dollars, an increasing percentage of our billings in recent periods has been in foreign currencies, particularly the Euro and British Pound Sterling. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates will cause variability in our billings. Foreign currency rate fluctuations had a favorable impact of $74 million and $21 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. •Timing of contract renewals. While customers typically renew their contracts at the end of the contract term, from time to time customers may do so either before or after the scheduled expiration date. For example, in cases where we are successful in selling additional products or services to an existing customer, a customer may decide to renew its existing contract early to ensure that all its contracts expire on the same date. In other cases, prolonged negotiations or other factors may result in a contract not being renewed until after it has expired.•Seasonality. We have historically experienced seasonality in terms of when we enter into customer agreements for our services. We sign a significantly higher percentage of agreements with new customers, as well as expansion with existing customers, in the fourth quarter of each year. The increase in customer agreements for the fourth quarter is primarily a result of both large enterprise account buying patterns typical in the software industry, which are driven primarily by the expiration of annual authorized budgeted expenditures, and the terms of our commission plans which incentivize our direct sales organization to meet their annual quotas by December 31. Furthermore, we usually sign a significant portion of these agreements during the last month, and often the last two weeks, of each quarter. This seasonality in the timing of entering into customer contracts is sometimes not immediately apparent in our billings, due to the fact that we typically exclude cloud-offering contracts with a future start date from our billings, unless such amounts have been paid as of the balance sheet date. Similarly, this seasonality is reflected to a much lesser extent, and sometimes is not immediately apparent in our revenues, due to the fact that we recognize subscription revenues from our cloud offering contracts over the term of the subscription agreement, which is generally 12 to 36 months. Although these seasonal factors are common in the technology industry, historical patterns should not be considered a reliable indicator of our future sales activity or performance. Further, the seasonal factors could be heightened due to the impact of a gross domestic product contraction and other impacts unknown on our customers and sales cycles caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.To facilitate greater year-over-year comparability in our billings results, we disclose the impact that foreign currency rate fluctuations and fluctuations in billings duration had on our billings. The impact of foreign currency rate fluctuations is calculated by translating the current period results for entities reporting in currencies other than U.S. Dollars into U.S. Dollars at the exchange rates in effect during the prior period presented, rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the current period. The impact of fluctuations in billings duration is calculated by replacing the portion of multi-year billings in excess of 12 months during the current period with the portion of multi-year billings in excess of 12 months during the prior period presented. Notwithstanding the adjustments described above, the comparability of billings results from period to period remains subject to the impact of variations in the dollar value of contracts with future start dates and the timing of contract renewals, for which no adjustments have been presented.While we believe billings is one indicator of the performance of our business, due to the factors described above, an increase or decrease in billings may not reflect the actual performance for that reporting period. As a result, our billings metric has become less indicative of the actual performance of our business over time and we do not plan to disclose this metric in future filings.36Table of ContentsCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and EstimatesOur management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. These items are monitored and analyzed by us for changes in facts and circumstances, and material changes in these estimates could occur in the future. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Changes in estimates are reflected in reported results for the period in which they become known. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions and such differences could be material.While our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe that the following accounting policies are critical to the process of making significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our audited consolidated financial statements.Revenue RecognitionWe derive our revenues predominately from subscription revenues which are primarily comprised of subscription fees that give customers access to the ordered subscription service, related support and updates, if any, to the subscribed service during the subscription term. For our cloud services, we recognize subscription revenues ratably over the contract term beginning on the commencement date of each contract, the date we make our services available to our customers. Our contracts with customers typically include a fixed amount of consideration and are generally non-cancelable and without any refund-type provisions. Subscription revenues also include revenues from self-hosted offerings in which customers deploy, or we grant customers the option to deploy without significant penalty, our subscription service internally or contract with a third party to host the software. For these contracts, we account for the software element separately from the related support and updates as they are distinct performance obligations. The transaction price is allocated to separate performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price (“SSP”) basis. The transaction price allocated to the software element is recognized when transfer of control of the software to the customer is complete. The transaction price allocated to the related support and updates are recognized ratably over the contract term. We enter into contracts that can include various combinations of products and services, which are generally capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations. For these contracts, the transaction price is allocated to the separate performance obligations on a relative SSP basis. Evaluating the terms and conditions included within our customer contracts for appropriate revenue recognition and determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment.Deferred Commissions Deferred commissions are the incremental selling costs that are associated with acquiring customer contracts and consist primarily of sales commissions paid to our sales organization and referral fees paid to independent third parties. Commissions and referral fees earned upon the execution of initial and expansion contracts are primarily deferred and amortized over a period of benefit that we have determined to be five years consistent with prior year. Commissions earned upon the renewal of customer contracts are deferred and amortized over the average renewal term. Additionally, for self-hosted offerings, consistent with the recognition of subscription revenues for self-hosted offerings, a portion of the commission cost is expensed upfront when the self-hosted offering is made available. Determining the period of benefit including average renewal term requires judgment for which we take into consideration our customer contracts, our technology life cycle and other factors. 37Table of ContentsBusiness combinationsThe allocation of the purchase price in a business combination requires management to make significant estimates in determining the fair value of acquired assets and assumed liabilities, especially with respect to intangible assets. The excess of the purchase price in a business combination over the fair value of these tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. Critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, future expected cash flows, discount rates, the time and expense to recreate the assets and profit margin a market participant would receive. These estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. The Company evaluates these estimates and assumptions as new information is obtained and may record adjustments to the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed but not later than one year from the acquisition date. Income Taxes Our annual tax rate is based on our income, statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective government taxing authorities. Significant judgment is required in determining our tax expense (benefit) and in evaluating our tax positions, including evaluating uncertainties and the complexity of taxes on foreign earnings. We review our tax positions quarterly and adjust the balances as new information becomes available. Deferred tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years. Such assets arise because of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. We evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deductions and credits by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including future growth, forecasted earnings, future taxable income, the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate, historical earnings, taxable income in prior years, if carryback is permitted under the law, carryforward periods and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. A valuation allowance is established if it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. To the extent sufficient positive evidence becomes available, we may release all or a portion of our valuation allowance in one or more future periods. A release of the valuation allowance, if any, would result in the recognition of certain deferred tax assets and a material income tax benefit for the period in which such release is recorded.Due to cumulative losses including tax deductible stock compensation and based on all available positive and negative evidence, we have determined that it is more likely than not that our U.S. deferred tax assets will not be realizable as of December 31, 2021. Management applied significant judgment in assessing the positive and negative evidence available in the determination of the amount of deferred tax assets that were more likely than not to be realized in the future. In determining the need, or continued need, for a valuation allowance, we considered the weighting of the positive and negative evidence which includes, among other things, cumulative losses including tax deductible stock compensation expense , future growth, forecasted earnings, and future taxable income.Our tax positions are subject to income tax audits by multiple tax jurisdictions throughout the world. We recognize the tax benefit of an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not the position is sustainable upon examination by the taxing authority based on the technical merits. We measure the tax benefit recognized as the largest amount of benefit which is more likely than not to be realized upon settlement with the taxing authority. We recognize interest accrued and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in our tax provision. Significant judgment is required to evaluate uncertain tax positions. Our evaluations are based upon a number of factors, including changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law or guidance, correspondence with tax authorities during the course of audits and effective settlement of audit issues. Changes in the recognition or measurement of uncertain tax positions could result in material increases or decreases in our income tax expense in the period in which we make the change, which could have a material impact on our effective tax rate and operating results.We calculate the current and deferred income tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed in subsequent years and record adjustments based on filed income tax returns when identified. The amount of income taxes paid is subject to examination by U.S. federal, state and foreign tax authorities. The estimate of the potential outcome of any uncertain tax issue is subject to management’s assessment of relevant risks, facts and circumstances existing at that time. To the extent the assessment of such tax position changes, we record the change in estimate in the period in which we make the determination.38Table of ContentsChange in Accounting EstimateIn January 2022, we completed an assessment of the useful life of our data center equipment and determined we should increase the estimated useful life of data center equipment from three to four years. This change in accounting estimate will be effective beginning fiscal year 2022. Based on the carrying amount of data center equipment included in property and equipment, net that are in-service as of December 31, 2021, it is estimated this change will increase our fiscal year 2022 operating income by approximately $80 million.New Accounting Pronouncements Pending AdoptionThe impact of recently issued accounting standards is set forth in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Components of Results of Operations RevenuesSubscription revenues. Subscription revenues are primarily comprised of fees that give customers access to the ordered subscription service for both self-hosted offerings and cloud-based subscription offerings, and related standard and enhanced support and updates, if any, to the subscription service during the subscription term. For our cloud-based offerings, we recognize revenue ratably over the subscription term. For self-hosted offerings, a substantial portion of the sales price is recognized upon delivery of the software, which may cause greater variability in our subscription revenues and subscription gross margin. Pricing includes multiple instances, hosting and support services, data backup and disaster recovery services, as well as future updates, when and if available, offered during the subscription term. We typically invoice our customers for subscription fees in annual increments upon execution of the initial contract or subsequent renewal. Our contracts are generally non-cancelable during the subscription term, though a customer can terminate for breach if we materially fail to perform. Professional services and other revenues. Our arrangements for professional services are primarily on a time-and-materials basis, and we generally invoice our customers monthly in arrears for the professional services based on actual hours and expenses incurred. Some of our professional services arrangements are on a fixed fee or subscription basis. Professional services revenues are recognized as services are delivered. Other revenues primarily consist of fees from customer training delivered on-site or through publicly available classes. Typical payment terms require our customers to pay us within 30 days of invoice. We sell our subscription services primarily through our direct sales organization. We also sell services through managed service providers and resale partners. We also generate revenues from certain professional services and from training of customers and partner personnel, through both our direct team and indirect channel sales. Revenues from our direct sales organization represented 79%, 81% and 82% of our total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. For purposes of calculating revenues from our direct sales organization, revenues from systems integrators and managed services providers are included as part of the direct sales organization. Cost of RevenuesCost of subscription revenues. Cost of subscription revenues consists primarily of expenses related to hosting our services and providing support to our customers. These expenses are comprised of data center capacity costs, which include colocation costs associated with our data centers as well as interconnectivity between data centers, depreciation related to our infrastructure hardware equipment dedicated for customer use, amortization of intangible assets, expenses associated with software, public cloud service costs, IT services and dedicated customer support, personnel-related costs directly associated with data center operations and customer support, including salaries, benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation and allocated overhead.Cost of professional services and other revenues. Cost of professional services and other revenues consists primarily of personnel-related costs directly associated with our professional services and training departments, including salaries, benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation, the costs of contracted third-party partners, travel expenses and allocated overhead.39Table of ContentsProfessional services are performed directly by our services team, as well as by contracted third-party partners. Fees paid by us to third-party partners are primarily recognized as cost of revenues as the professional services are delivered. Cost of revenues associated with our professional services engagements contracted with third-party partners as a percentage of professional services and other revenues was 14%, 10% and 15% for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.Sales and MarketingSales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel-related expenses directly associated with our sales and marketing staff, including salaries, benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation. Sales and marketing expenses also include the amortization of commissions paid to our sales employees, including related payroll taxes and fringe benefits. In addition, sales and marketing expenses include branding expenses, marketing program expenses, which include events such as Knowledge, and costs associated with purchasing advertising and marketing data, software and subscription services dedicated for sales and marketing use and allocated overhead.Research and DevelopmentResearch and development expenses consist primarily of personnel-related expenses directly associated with our research and development staff, including salaries, benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation and allocated overhead. Research and development expenses also include data center capacity costs, costs associated with outside services contracted for research and development purposes and depreciation of infrastructure hardware equipment that is used solely for research and development purposes. General and AdministrativeGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel-related expenses for our executive, finance, legal, human resources, facilities and administrative personnel, including salaries, benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation, external legal, accounting and other professional services fees, other corporate expenses, amortization of intangible assets and allocated overhead.Provision for (benefit from) Income TaxesProvision for (benefit from) income taxes consist of federal, state and foreign income taxes. Due to cumulative losses, we maintain a valuation allowance against our U.S. deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2021 and 2020. We consider all available evidence, both positive and negative, including but not limited to earnings history, projected future outcomes, industry and market trends and the nature of each of the deferred tax assets in assessing the extent to which a valuation allowance should be applied against our U.S. and foreign deferred tax assets.

Included in subscription revenues is $241 million and $205 million of revenues recognized upfront from the delivery of software associated with self-hosted offerings during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We expect subscription revenues for the year ending December 31, 2022 to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to add new customers and existing customers increase their usage of our products, but remain relatively flat as a percentage of revenue compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. We will continue to monitor the COVID-19 pandemic in 2022 and its impact on customer acquisition and renewal rates.Our expectations for revenues, cost of revenues and operating expenses for the year ending December 31, 2022 are based on the 31-day average of foreign exchange rates for December 2021.Subscription revenues consist of the following:Year Ended December 31,% Change20212020(dollars in millions)Digital workflow products$4,882 $3,749 30 %ITOM products691 537 29 %Total subscription revenues$5,573 $4,286 30 %Our digital workflow products include the Now Platform, IT Service Management, IT Business Management, IT Asset Management, Security Operations, Governance, Risk and Compliance, HR Service Delivery, Safe Workplace Suite of applications, Workplace Service Delivery, Legal Service Delivery, Customer Service Management, Field Service Management, Industry Solutions, App Engine and IntegrationHub, and are generally priced on a per user basis. Our ITOM products are generally priced on a per node (physical or virtual server) basis and increasingly on a subscription unit basis which allows us to measure customers’ management of physical IT resources. Professional services and other revenues increased by $90 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to the prior year, due to an increase in services and trainings provided to new and existing customers. We expect professional services and other revenues for the year ending December 31, 2022 to increase in absolute dollars, but remain relatively flat as a percentage of revenue compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. We are increasingly focused on deploying our internal professional services organization as a strategic resource and relying on our partner ecosystem to contract directly with customers for implementation services delivery.

Personnel-related costs including stock-based compensation and overhead expenses increased by $123 million as compared to prior year. Depreciation expense related to data center hardware and software and maintenance costs to support the expansion of our data center capacity including public cloud service costs increased by $141 million and amortization of intangibles increased by $29 million as a result of acquisitions as compared to the prior year. We expect our cost of subscription revenues for the year ending December 31, 2022 to increase in absolute dollars as we provide subscription services to more customers and increase usage within our customer instances but slightly decrease as a percentage of revenue resulting from the change in estimated useful life of data center equipment from three to four years beginning in 2022. Our subscription gross profit percentage was 82% and 83% for each of the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We expect our subscription gross profit percentage to slightly increase for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021 driven by the change in estimated useful life of data center equipment from three to four years beginning in 2022. However, we will continue to incur incremental costs to attract customers in regulated markets by adopting public cloud offerings as well as increased support for customers impacted by new and evolving data residency requirements. To the extent future acquisitions are consummated, our cost of subscription revenues may increase due to additional non-cash charges associated with the amortization of intangible assets acquired.Cost of professional services and other revenues increased by $75 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the prior year. The increase was primarily due to increased headcount to support growth resulting in an increase in personnel-related costs including stock-based compensation and overhead expenses by $55 million and an increase in outside service costs by $20 million compared to prior period.Our professional services and other gross loss percentage improved to 2% for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to 10% in the prior year, primarily driven by the increased utilization of our internal professional services organization and the reduction in certain travel expenses. However, we expect our professional services and other gross loss percentage to worsen for the year ending December 31, 2022 as we expect additional cost to support business growth and increases in travel expenses compared to the year ended December 31, 2021.Sales and Marketing Year Ended December 31,% Change 20212020 (dollars in millions) Sales and marketing$2,292 $1,855 24 %Percentage of revenues39 %41 %Sales and marketing expenses increased by $437 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to the prior year.

Amortization of deferred commissions and third-party referral fees increased by $79 million, compared to the prior year, due to an increase in contracts with new customers, expansion and renewal contracts. Other sales and marketing program expenses, which include branding, purchase of advertising and market data and outside services, increased by $29 million compared to the prior year. We converted certain in-person events to digital events in the first half of 2021 amid COVID-19 travel restrictions which resulted in certain savings for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the same period in the prior year.We expect sales and marketing expenses for the year ending December 31, 2022 to increase in absolute dollars, but remain relatively flat as a percentage of revenue compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, as we continue to see leverage from increased sales productivity and marketing efficiencies offset by growth in our international operations and increases in travel expenses in 2022.42Table of ContentsResearch and Development Year Ended December 31,% Change 20212020 (dollars in millions) Research and development$1,397 $1,024 36 %Percentage of revenues24 %23 %Research and development expenses increased by $373 million during the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to the prior year.

The increase was primarily due to increased headcount resulting in an increase in personnel-related costs including stock-based compensation and overhead expenses of $113 million. The remaining increase was primarily due to $21 million of outside service costs to support digital transformation projects across functions to improve processes as we scale as well as incremental investment in environmental, social and corporate governance initiatives (“ESG”).We expect general and administrative expenses for the year ending December 31, 2022 to increase in absolute dollars but remain relatively flat as a percentage of revenue compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, as we continue to see leverage from continued G&A productivity, offset by higher stock-based compensation related to the 2021 Performance Awards, increased investment in cyber security and our ESG efforts. 43Table of ContentsStock-based Compensation Year Ended December 31,% Change 20212020 (dollars in millions) Cost of revenues:Subscription$128 $98 31 %Professional services and other59 52 13 %Sales and marketing389 320 22 %Research and development395 282 40 %General and administrative160 118 36 %Total stock-based compensation$1,131 $870 30 %Percentage of revenues19 %19 %Stock-based compensation increased by $261 million during the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to the prior year, primarily due to additional grants to current and new employees and increased weighted-average grant date fair value of stock awards. Stock-based compensation is inherently difficult to forecast due to fluctuations in our stock price. Based upon our stock price as of December 31, 2021, we expect stock-based compensation to continue to increase in absolute dollars for the year ending December 31, 2022 as we continue to issue stock-based awards to our employees, but remain relatively flat as a percentage of revenue compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. We expect stock-based compensation as a percentage of revenue to decline over time as we continue to grow.Foreign Currency ExchangeOur international operations have provided and will continue to provide a significant portion of our total revenues. Revenues outside North America represented 36% and 35% of total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Because we primarily transact in foreign currencies for sales outside of the United States, the general weakening of the U.S. Dollar relative to other major foreign currencies (primarily the Euro and British Pound Sterling) during the year ended December 31, 2021 had a favorable impact on our revenues. For entities reporting in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar, if we had translated our results for the year ended December 31, 2021 at the exchange rates in effect for the year ended December 31, 2020 rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the period, our reported subscription revenues would have been $77 million lower. The impact from the foreign currency movements was not material for professional services and other revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021.In addition, because we primarily transact in foreign currencies for cost of revenues and operating expenses outside of the United States, the general weakening of the U.S. Dollar relative to other major foreign currencies had an unfavorable impact on our cost of revenue and sales and marketing expense during the year ended December 31, 2021. For entities reporting in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar, if we had translated our results for the year ended December 31, 2021 at the exchange rates in effect for the year ended December 31, 2020 rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the period, our reported cost of revenues and sales and marketing expenses would have been $22 million and $25 million lower for the year ended December 31, 2021, respectively. The impact from the foreign currency movements from the year ended December 31, 2020 to the year ended December 31, 2021 was not material to research and development and general and administrative expenses.44Table of ContentsInterest ExpenseYear Ended December 31,% Change20212020(dollars in millions)Interest expense$(28)$(33)(15 %)Percentage of revenues— %(1 %)Interest expense decreased during the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to the prior year, due to the decrease in amortization expense of debt discount and issuance costs as a result of lower outstanding principal balance of the 2022 Notes. For the year ending December 31, 2022, we expect to incur approximately $25 million related to the 2030 Notes and 2022 Notes.Other Income (Expense), net Year Ended December 31,% Change 20212020 (dollars in millions) Interest income$20 $39 (49)%Loss on extinguishment of 2022 Notes(3)(47)94 %Other3 (8)138 %Other income (expense), net$20 $(16)225 %Other income (expense), net increased by $36 million during the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to the prior year, primarily driven by the lower loss on extinguishment of the 2022 Notes due primarily to the 2022 Notes Repurchase which occurred in 2020 and a larger amount of early conversions of the 2022 Notes and lower foreign currency exchange losses, mainly offset by a decrease in interest income resulting from the decline in interest rates.To mitigate our risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, we enter into foreign currency derivative contracts with maturities of 12 months or less to hedge a portion of our net outstanding monetary assets and liabilities. These hedging contracts may reduce, but cannot entirely eliminate, the impact of adverse currency exchange rate movements. 45Table of ContentsProvision for (benefit from) Income Taxes Year Ended December 31,% Change 20212020 (dollars in millions) Income before income taxes$249 $150 66 %Provision for (benefit from) income taxes19 31 (39 %)Effective tax rate8 %21 %(62)% Our effective tax rate was 8% and 21% for the years ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. The difference in rates was primarily attributable to the mix of earnings and losses in foreign jurisdictions with differing tax rates, including a revaluation of our deferred taxes to account for a change in the United Kingdom tax rate, and a partial valuation allowance release related to acquired Lightstep, Inc. deferred tax liabilities. See Note 16 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for our reconciliation of income taxes at the statutory federal rate to the provision for (benefit from) income taxes.We maintained a full valuation allowance on our U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The significant components of the tax expense recorded are current cash taxes payable in various jurisdictions. The cash tax expenses are impacted by each jurisdiction’s individual tax rates, laws on timing of recognition of income and deductions, and availability of net operating losses and tax credits. Given the full valuation allowance on our U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets, sensitivity of current cash taxes to local rules and our foreign structuring, we expect that our effective tax rate could fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis and could be adversely affected to the extent earnings are lower than anticipated in countries that have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher statutory rates. To the extent sufficient positive evidence becomes available, we may release all or a portion of our valuation allowance in one or more future periods. A release of the valuation allowance, if any, would result in the recognition of certain deferred tax assets and a material income tax benefit for the period in which such release is recorded.Liquidity and Capital Resources We generate cash inflows from operations primarily from selling subscription services which are generally paid in advance of provisioning services, and cash outflows to develop new services and core technologies that further enhance the Now Platform, engage our customer and enhance their experience, and enable and transform our business operations. Subscription services arrangements typically have a three-year duration, and we have experienced a renewal rate of 98% over the last three years. Cash outflows from operations are principally comprised of the salaries, bonuses, commissions, and benefits for our workforce; licenses and services arrangements that are integral to our business operations and data centers; and operating lease arrangements that underlie our facilities. We have generated positive operating cash flows over the last ten years as we continue to grow our business in pursuit of our business strategy, and we expect to grow our business and generate positive cash flows from operations during 2022. When assessing sources of liquidity, we also include cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and long-term investments totaling $4.9 billion as of December 31, 2021.Our working capital requirements are principally comprised of non-contract workforce salaries, bonuses, commissions, and benefits and, to a lesser extent, cancellable and non-cancelable licenses and services arrangements that are integral to our business operations, and operating lease obligations. Non-cancelable purchase commitments for business operations total $383 million as of December 31, 2021, due primarily over the next five years. In addition. we expect payment for the investment in Celonis SE of $100 million in the first quarter of 2022. Operating lease obligations totaling $741 million are principally associated with leased facilities and have varying maturities with $418 million due over the next five years.To grow our business, we also invest in capital and expand our facilities to enable our data centers and workforce and consider strategic acquisitions of technology and businesses to supplement our technology portfolio. Our capital expenditures are typically under cancelable arrangements primarily used to support the installed base and growth of our hosted business. We have also issued long-term debt to finance our business. In August 2020, we issued 1.40% fixed rate ten-year notes with an aggregate principal amount of $1.5 billion due on September 1, 2030 (the “2030 Notes”). In May and June 2017, we issued the 2022 Notes with an aggregate principal amount of $782.5 million. The remaining principal amount of the 2022 Notes, totaling $92 million, will be settled in cash during the first half of 2022.46Table of ContentsOur free cash flows, together with our other sources of liquidity, are available to service our liabilities as well as our cancellable and non-cancellable arrangements. We anticipate cash flows generated from operations, cash, cash equivalents and investments will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for at least the next 12 months. As we look beyond the next 12 months, we seek to continue to grow free cash flows necessary to fund our operations and grow our business. If we require additional capital resources, we may seek to finance our operations from the current funds available or additional equity or debt financing. Year Ended December 31, 20212020 (in millions)Net cash provided by operating activities$2,191 $1,786 Net cash used in investing activities(1,607)(1,507)Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities(506)597 Net increase in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash53 901 Operating ActivitiesNet cash provided by operating activities was $2.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $1.8 billion for the prior year. The net increase in operating cash flow was primarily due to increase in operating income and higher collections driven by revenue growth compared to settlement of payables. In addition, we benefited from a reduction in repayments of 2022 Notes attributable to debt discount. Investing ActivitiesNet cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $1.6 billion compared to $1.5 billion for the prior year. The net increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to $678 million increase in business combinations, net of cash and restricted cash acquired, and $59 million purchase of new strategic investments offset by $586 million decrease in net purchases of investments.Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $506 million compared to net provided by financing activities of $597 million for the prior year. The change was primarily driven by the $1.5 billion proceeds from the issuance of 2030 Notes in the year ended December 31, 2020, offset by the 2022 Notes Repurchase of $1.6 billion which was funded in part by the proceeds received from the partial unwind of the 2022 Note hedge of $1.1 billion. The remaining change was due to $103 million increase in taxes paid related to net share settlement of equity awards offset by $21 million increase in proceeds from employee equity plans primarily driven by higher share price compared to prior year.Contractual Obligations and CommitmentsOur estimated future obligations consist of leases, an agreement to purchase $100 million of common and preferred shares in Celonis SE, purchase obligations, debt and unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2021. Refer to Note 17 “Commitments and Contingencies” and Note 19 “Subsequent Events” to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information.47Table of ContentsITEM 7A.QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKForeign Currency Exchange RiskWe have foreign currency risks related to our revenue and operating expenses denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar, primarily the Euro and British Pound Sterling. We are a net receiver of Euro and British Pound Sterling, and therefore benefit from a weakening of the U.S. Dollar relative to these currencies and, conversely, are adversely affected by a strengthening of the U.S. Dollar relative to these currencies. Revenues denominated in U.S. Dollar as a percentage of total revenues was 70% during the year ended December 31, 2021 and 71% for each of the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. To mitigate our risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, we enter into foreign currency derivative contracts to hedge a portion of our net outstanding monetary assets and liabilities. These derivative contracts are intended to offset gains or losses related to remeasuring monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entities in which they are recorded.A hypothetical 10% increase in the U.S. Dollar against other currencies would have resulted in a decrease in operating income of $62 million, $47 million and $31 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. This analysis disregards the possibilities that rates can move in opposite directions and that losses from one geographic area may be offset by gains from another geographic area.These derivative contracts expose us to credit risk to the extent that the counterparties may be unable to meet the terms of the arrangement. We mitigate this credit risk by transacting with major financial institutions with high credit ratings and entering into master netting arrangements, which permit net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty. While the contract or notional amount is often used to express the volume of foreign currency derivative contracts, the amounts potentially subject to credit risk are generally limited to the amounts, if any, by which the counterparties’ obligations under the agreements exceed our obligations to the counterparties. We are not required to pledge, and are not entitled to receive, cash collateral related to these derivative instruments. We do not enter into derivative contracts for trading or speculative purposes. Refer to Note 8 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. Interest Rate Sensitivity We had an aggregate of $4.9 billion in cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and long-term investments as of December 31, 2021. This amount was invested primarily in money market funds, certificates of deposit, corporate notes and bonds, government and agency securities and other debt securities with a minimum rating of BBB by Standard & Poor’s, Baa2 by Moody’s, or BBB by Fitch. The primary objectives of our investment activities are the preservation of capital and support of our liquidity requirements. Our investments are exposed to market risk due to fluctuations in interest rates, which may affect our interest income and the fair market value of our investments. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would have resulted in an approximate $30 million decline of the fair value of our available-for-sale securities. This estimate is based on a sensitivity model that measures market value changes when changes in interest rates occur.As of December 31, 2020, we had an aggregate of $4.6 billion in cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and long-term investments, and a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would have resulted in an approximate $29 million decline of the fair value of our available-for-sale securities. 48Table of ContentsMarket RiskIn August 2020, we issued 1.40% fixed rate ten-year notes with an aggregate principal amount of $1.5 billion due on September 1, 2030. The 2030 Notes were issued at 99.63% of principal and we incurred approximately $13 million for debt issuance costs. Interest is payable semi-annually in arrears on March 1 and September 1 of each year, beginning on March 1, 2021, and the entire outstanding principal amount is due at maturity on September 1, 2030. The 2030 Notes are unsecured obligations and the indentures governing the 2030 Notes contain customary events of default and covenants that, among others and subject to exceptions, restrict the Company’s ability to incur or guarantee debt secured by liens on specified assets or enter into sale and lease-back transactions with respect to specified properties. In May and June 2017, we issued the 2022 Notes with an aggregate principal amount of $782.5 million. We carry these instruments at face value less unamortized discount on our consolidated balance sheet. Because these instruments do not bear interest, we have no economic interest rate exposure on our 2022 Notes associated with changes in interest rates. However, the fair value of our 2022 Notes is exposed to interest rate risks. Generally, the fair market value of our 2022 Notes will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. In addition, the fair value of the 2022 Notes is affected by our stock price due to the conversion feature and will generally increase as the stock price increases.We hold cash balances with multiple financial institutions in various countries and these balances routinely exceed deposit insurance limits.As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had $99 million and $28 million, respectively, of equity investments in privately-held companies that are in the development stage. The fair value of these strategic investments may fluctuate depending on the financial condition and near-term prospects of these companies, and we may be required to record an impairment charge if the carrying value of these investments exceed their fair value. We are required to measure equity securities at fair value with changes in fair value recognized through our consolidated statements of comprehensive income. As a result, we anticipate additional volatility to our consolidated statements of comprehensive income in future periods as we continue to strategically invest and grow the portfolio, due to the valuation and timing of observable price changes of our investments in privately held securities. These changes could be material based on market conditions and events.49Table of Contents",2023-12-30 18:26:33.849555

A discussion of our financial condition and results of operations for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020 and year-to-year comparisons between fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 that is not included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K can be found in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, filed on February 3, 2022.Our free cash flow measure included in the section entitled “—Key Business Metrics—Free Cash Flow,” is not in accordance with GAAP. This non-GAAP financial measure is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. This measure may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, limiting its usefulness for comparison purposes. We encourage investors to carefully consider our results under GAAP, as well as our supplemental non-GAAP results, to more fully understand our business.OverviewServiceNow was founded on a simple premise: a better technology platform will help work flow better. Our purpose is to make the world work better for everyone. We help global enterprises across industries, universities and governments to digitize their workflows. The Now Platform, seamlessly connects workflows across siloed organizations and systems in a way that unlocks productivity, improves experiences for both employees and customers and delivers real business outcomes. We organize our workflow applications along four primary areas: Technology, Customer and Industry, Employee and Creator. The Now Platform enables our customers’ digital transformation from non-integrated enterprise technology solutions with manual and disconnected processes and activities, to integrated enterprise technology solutions with automation and connected processes and activities. The transformation to digital operations, enabled by the Now Platform, increases our customers’ resiliency and security and delivers great experiences and additional value to their employees and consumers.We are closely monitoring the unfolding events of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. While the Russia-Ukraine conflict is still evolving and the outcome remains highly uncertain, we do not believe the Russia-Ukraine conflict will have a material impact on our business and results of operations. However, if the Russia-Ukraine conflict continues or worsens, leading to greater global economic disruptions and uncertainty, our business and results of operations could be materially impacted. Our customers in Russia represented an immaterial portion of our net assets and total consolidated revenues both as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021.See the “Risk Factors” section in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report for further discussion of the possible impact of the Russia-Ukraine conflict on our business.Key Business MetricsRemaining performance obligations. Transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations (“RPO”) represents contracted revenue that has not yet been recognized, which includes deferred revenue and non-cancelable amounts that will be invoiced and recognized as revenue in future periods. RPO excludes contracts that are billed in arrears, such as certain time and materials contracts, as we apply the “right to invoice” practical expedient under relevant accounting guidance. Current remaining performance obligations (“cRPO”) represents RPO that will be recognized as revenue in the next 12 months.30Table of ContentsAs of December 31, 2022, our RPO was $14 billion, of which 49% represented cRPO. RPO and cRPO increased by 22%, respectively, compared to December 31, 2021. Factors that may cause our RPO to vary from period to period include the following:•Foreign currency exchange rates. While a majority of our contracts have historically been in U.S. Dollars, an increasing percentage of our contracts in recent periods has been in foreign currencies, particularly the Euro and British Pound Sterling. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates as of the balance sheet date will cause variability in our RPO.•Mix of offerings. In a minority of cases, we allow our customers to host our software by themselves or through a third-party service provider. In self-hosted offerings, we recognize a portion of the revenue upfront upon the delivery of the software and as a result, such revenue is excluded from RPO. •Subscription start date. From time to time, we enter into contracts with a subscription start date in the future and these amounts are included in RPO if such contracts are signed by the balance sheet date. •Timing of contract renewals. While customers typically renew their contracts at the end of the contract term, from time to time, customers may do so either before or after the scheduled expiration date. For example, in cases where we are successful in selling additional products or services to an existing customer, a customer may decide to renew its existing contract early to ensure that all its contracts expire on the same date. In other cases, prolonged negotiations or other factors may result in a contract not being renewed until after it has expired. •Contract duration. While we typically enter into multi-year subscription services, the duration of our contracts varies. Further, we continue to see an increase in the number of 12-month agreements entered into with the U.S. federal government throughout the year, with the highest number of agreements entered into in the quarter ended September 30, driven primarily by timing of their annual budget expenditures. We sometimes also enter into contracts with durations that have a 12-month or shorter term to enable the contracts to co-terminate with the existing contract. The contract duration will cause variability in our RPO. Number of customers with ACV greater than $1 million. We count the total number of customers with annual contract value (“ACV”) greater than $1 million as of the end of the period. We had 1,637, 1,346, and 1,082 customers with ACV greater than $1 million as of December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. For purposes of customer count, a customer is defined as an entity that has a unique Dunn & Bradstreet Global Ultimate (“GULT”) Data Universal Numbering System (“DUNS”) number and an active subscription contract as of the measurement date. The DUNS number is a global standard for business identification and tracking. We make exceptions for holding companies, government entities and other organizations for which the GULT, in our judgment, does not accurately represent the ServiceNow customer. For example, while all U.S. government agencies roll up to “Government of the United States” under the GULT, we count each government agency that we contract with as a separate customer. Our customer count is subject to adjustments for acquisitions, spin-offs and other market activity; accordingly, we restate previously disclosed number of customers with ACV greater than $1 million calculations to allow for comparability. ACV is calculated based on the foreign exchange rate in effect at the time the contract was signed. Foreign exchange rate fluctuations could cause some variability in the number of customers with ACV greater than $1 million. We believe information regarding the total number of customers with ACV greater than $1 million provides useful information to investors because it is an indicator of our growing customer base and demonstrates the value customers are receiving from the Now Platform. Free cash flow. We define free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, as GAAP net cash provided by operating activities reduced by purchases of property and equipment. Purchases of property and equipment are otherwise included in cash used in investing activities under GAAP. We believe information regarding free cash flow provides useful information to investors because it is an indicator of the strength and performance of our business operations. However, our calculation of free cash flow may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies. A calculation of free cash flow is provided below:31Table of Contents Year Ended December 31, 202220212020(in millions)Free cash flow:Net cash provided by operating activities$2,723 $2,191 $1,786 Purchases of property and equipment(550)(392)(419)Free cash flow (1)$2,173 $1,799 $1,367 (1)Free cash flow for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 include the effect of $15 million and $82 million, respectively, relating to the repayments of convertible senior notes attributable to debt discount. Refer to Note 11 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details.We have historically seen higher collections in the quarter ended March 31 due to seasonality in timing of entering into customer contracts, which is significantly higher in the quarter ended December 31. Additionally, we have historically seen higher disbursements in the quarters ended March 31 and September 30 due to payouts under our annual commission plans, purchases under our employee stock purchase plan, payouts under our bonus plans and coupon payments related to our 2030 Notes beginning in 2021.Renewal rate. We calculate our renewal rate by subtracting our attrition rate from 100%. Our attrition rate for a period is equal to the ACV from customers lost during the period, divided by the sum of (i) the total ACV from all customers that renewed during the period, excluding changes in price or users, and (ii) the total ACV from all customers lost during the period. Accordingly, our renewal rate is calculated based on ACV and is not based on the number of customers that have renewed. Further, our renewal rate does not reflect increased or decreased purchases from our customers to the extent such customers are not lost customers or lapsed renewals. A lost customer is a customer that did not renew an expiring contract and that, in our judgment, will not be renewed. Typically, a customer that reduces its subscription upon renewal is not considered a lost customer. However, in instances where the subscription decrease represents the majority of the customer’s ACV, we may deem the renewal as a lost customer. For our renewal rate calculation, we define a customer as an entity with a separate production instance of our service and an active subscription contract as of the measurement date, instead of an entity with a unique GULT or DUNS number. We adjust our renewal rate for acquisitions, consolidations and other customer events that cause the merging of two or more accounts occurring at the time of renewal. Our renewal rate was 98% for each of the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. As our renewal rate is impacted by the timing of renewals, which could occur in advance of, or subsequent to the original contract end date, period-to-period comparison of renewal rates may not be meaningful.Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and EstimatesOur management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. These items are monitored and analyzed by us for changes in facts and circumstances, and material changes in these estimates could occur in the future. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Changes in estimates are reflected in reported results for the period in which they become known. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions and such differences could be material.While our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe that the following accounting policies are critical to the process of making significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our audited consolidated financial statements.32Table of ContentsRevenue RecognitionWe derive our revenues predominately from subscription revenues, which are primarily comprised of subscription fees that give customers access to the ordered subscription service, related support and updates, if any, to the subscribed service during the subscription term. For our cloud services, we recognize subscription revenues ratably over the contract term beginning on the commencement date of each contract, the date we make our services available to our customers. Our contracts with customers typically include a fixed amount of consideration and are generally non-cancelable and without any refund-type provisions. Subscription revenues also include revenues from self-hosted offerings in which customers deploy, or we grant customers the option to deploy without significant penalty, our subscription service internally or contract with a third party to host the software. For these contracts, we account for the software element separately from the related support and updates as they are distinct performance obligations. The transaction price is allocated to separate performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price (“SSP”) basis. The transaction price allocated to the software element is recognized when transfer of control of the software to the customer is complete. The transaction price allocated to the related support and updates are recognized ratably over the contract term. We enter into contracts that can include various combinations of products and services, which are generally capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations. For these contracts, the transaction price is allocated to the separate performance obligations on a relative SSP basis. Evaluating the terms and conditions included within our customer contracts for appropriate revenue recognition and determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment.Deferred Commissions Deferred commissions are the incremental selling costs that are associated with acquiring customer contracts and consist primarily of sales commissions paid to our sales organization and referral fees paid to independent third parties. Commissions and referral fees earned upon the execution of initial and expansion contracts are primarily deferred and amortized over a period of benefit that we have determined to be five years consistent with prior year. Commissions earned upon the renewal of customer contracts are deferred and amortized over the average renewal term. Additionally, for self-hosted offerings, consistent with the recognition of subscription revenues for self-hosted offerings, a portion of the commission cost is expensed upfront when the self-hosted offering is made available. Determining the period of benefit, including average renewal term, requires judgment for which we take into consideration our customer contracts, our technology life cycle and other factors. Business CombinationsThe allocation of the purchase price in a business combination requires management to make significant estimates in determining the fair value of acquired assets and assumed liabilities, especially with respect to intangible assets. The excess of the purchase price in a business combination over the fair value of these tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. Critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, future expected cash flows, discount rates, the time and expense to recreate the assets and profit margin a market participant would receive. These estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. The Company evaluates these estimates and assumptions as new information is obtained and may record adjustments to the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed but not later than one year from the acquisition date. Income Taxes Our annual tax rate is based on our income, statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective government taxing authorities. Significant judgment is required in determining our tax expense (benefit) and in evaluating our tax positions, including evaluating uncertainties and the complexity of taxes on foreign earnings. We review our tax positions quarterly and adjust the balances as new information becomes available. 33Table of ContentsDeferred tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years. Such assets arise because of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. We evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deductions and credits by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including future growth, forecasted earnings, future taxable income, the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate, historical earnings, taxable income in prior years, if carryback is permitted under the law, carryforward periods and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. A valuation allowance is established if it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. To the extent sufficient positive evidence becomes available, we may release all or a portion of our valuation allowance in one or more future periods. A release of the valuation allowance, if any, would result in the recognition of certain deferred tax assets and a material income tax benefit for the period in which such release is recorded.Due to cumulative losses, including tax deductible stock compensation, and based on all available positive and negative evidence, we have determined that it is more likely than not that our U.S. deferred tax assets will not be realizable as of December 31, 2022. Management applied significant judgment in assessing the positive and negative evidence available in the determination of the amount of deferred tax assets that were more likely than not to be realized in the future. In determining the need, or continued need, for a valuation allowance, we considered the weighting of the positive and negative evidence which includes, among other things, cumulative losses including tax deductible stock compensation expense, future growth, forecasted earnings and future taxable income. However, given our current earnings, anticipated future earnings and future taxable income, we believe there is a reasonable possibility that within the next 12 months, sufficient positive evidence may become available to allow us to reach a conclusion that the U.S. valuation allowance will no longer be needed. The exact timing and amount of the valuation allowance release are subject to change on the basis of the level of sustained U.S. profitability that the Company is able to actually achieve, as well as the amount of tax deductible stock compensation dependent upon our publicly traded share price, foreign currency movements and macroeconomic conditions, among other factors. See Note 16 – Income Taxes, in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on discussion on valuation allowance. Our tax positions are subject to income tax audits by multiple tax jurisdictions throughout the world. We recognize the tax benefit of an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not the position is sustainable upon examination by the taxing authority based on the technical merits. We measure the tax benefit recognized as the largest amount of benefit which is more likely than not to be realized upon settlement with the taxing authority. We recognize interest accrued and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in our tax provision. Significant judgment is required to evaluate uncertain tax positions. Our evaluations are based upon a number of factors, including changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law or guidance, correspondence with tax authorities during the course of audits and effective settlement of audit issues. Changes in the recognition or measurement of uncertain tax positions could result in material increases or decreases in our income tax expense in the period in which we make the change, which could have a material impact on our effective tax rate and operating results.We calculate the current and deferred income tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed in subsequent years and record adjustments based on filed income tax returns when identified. The amount of income taxes paid is subject to examination by U.S. federal, state and foreign tax authorities. The estimate of the potential outcome of any uncertain tax issue is subject to management’s assessment of relevant risks, facts and circumstances existing at that time. To the extent the assessment of such tax position changes, we record the change in estimate in the period in which we make the determination.Change in Accounting EstimateSee Note 2 —Summary of Significant Accounting Policies — Use of Estimates, of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on our change in estimated useful life of our data center equipment during 2022.34Table of ContentsComponents of Results of Operations RevenuesSubscription revenues. Subscription revenues are primarily comprised of fees that give customers access to the ordered subscription service for both self-hosted offerings and cloud-based subscription offerings, and related standard and enhanced support and updates, if any, to the subscription service during the subscription term. For our cloud-based offerings, we recognize revenue ratably over the subscription term. For self-hosted offerings, a substantial portion of the sales price is recognized upon delivery of the software, which may cause greater variability in our subscription revenues and subscription gross margin. Pricing includes multiple instances, hosting and support services, data backup and disaster recovery services, as well as future updates, when and if available, offered during the subscription term. We typically invoice our customers for subscription fees in annual increments upon execution of the initial contract or subsequent renewal. Our contracts are generally non-cancelable during the subscription term, though a customer can terminate for breach if we materially fail to perform. Professional services and other revenues. Our arrangements for professional services are primarily on a time-and-materials basis, and we generally invoice our customers monthly in arrears for the professional services based on actual hours and expenses incurred. Some of our professional services arrangements are on a fixed fee. Professional services revenues are recognized as services are delivered. Other revenues primarily consist of fees from customer training delivered on-site or through publicly available classes. Typical payment terms require our customers to pay us within 30 days of invoice. We sell our subscription services primarily through our direct sales organization. We also sell services through managed service providers and resale partners. We also generate revenues from certain professional services and from training of customers and partner personnel, through both our direct team and indirect channel sales. Revenues from our direct sales organization represented 79%, 79% and 81% of our total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. For purposes of calculating revenues from our direct sales organization, revenues from systems integrators and managed services providers are included as part of the direct sales organization. Seasonality. We have historically experienced seasonality in terms of when we enter into customer agreements. We sign a significantly higher percentage of agreements with new customers, as well as expansion with existing customers, in the fourth quarter of each year. The increase in customer agreements for the fourth quarter is primarily a result of both large enterprise account buying patterns typical in the software industry, which are driven primarily by the expiration of annual authorized budgeted expenditures, and the terms of our commission plans, which incentivize our direct sales organization to meet their annual quotas by December 31. Furthermore, we usually sign a significant portion of these agreements during the last month, and often the last two weeks, of each quarter. This seasonality of entering into customer agreements is sometimes not immediately apparent in our revenues, due to the fact that we recognize subscription revenues from our cloud offering contracts over the term of the subscription agreement, which is generally 12 to 36 months, leading to a higher RPO in the fourth quarter. Although these seasonal factors are common in the technology industry, historical patterns should not be considered a reliable indicator of our future sales activity or performance.Cost of RevenuesCost of subscription revenues. Cost of subscription revenues consists primarily of expenses related to hosting our services and providing support to our customers. These expenses are comprised of data center capacity costs, which include colocation costs associated with our data centers as well as interconnectivity between data centers, depreciation related to our infrastructure hardware equipment dedicated for customer use, amortization of intangible assets, expenses associated with software, public cloud service costs, IT services and dedicated customer support, personnel-related costs directly associated with data center operations and customer support, including salaries, benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation and allocated overhead.Cost of professional services and other revenues. Cost of professional services and other revenues consists primarily of personnel-related costs directly associated with our professional services and training departments, including salaries, benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation, the costs of contracted third-party partners, travel expenses and allocated overhead.Professional services are performed directly by our services team, as well as by contracted third-party partners. Fees paid by us to third-party partners are primarily recognized as cost of revenues as the professional services are delivered. Cost of revenues associated with our professional services engagements contracted with third-party partners as a percentage of professional services and other revenues was 12%, 14% and 10% for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.35Table of ContentsSales and MarketingSales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel-related expenses directly associated with our sales and marketing staff, including salaries, benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation. Sales and marketing expenses also include the amortization of commissions paid to our sales employees, including related payroll taxes and fringe benefits. In addition, sales and marketing expenses include branding expenses, marketing program expenses, which include events such as Knowledge, and costs associated with purchasing advertising and marketing data, software and subscription services dedicated for sales and marketing use and allocated overhead.Research and DevelopmentResearch and development expenses consist primarily of personnel-related expenses directly associated with our research and development staff, including salaries, benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation and allocated overhead. Research and development expenses also include data center capacity costs, costs associated with outside services contracted for research and development purposes and depreciation of infrastructure hardware equipment that is used solely for research and development purposes. General and AdministrativeGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel-related expenses for our executive, finance, legal, human resources, facilities and administrative personnel, including salaries, benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation, external legal, accounting and other professional services fees, other corporate expenses, amortization of intangible assets and allocated overhead.Provision for Income TaxesProvision for income taxes consist of federal, state and foreign income taxes. Due to cumulative losses, we maintain a valuation allowance against our U.S. deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. We consider all available evidence, both positive and negative, including but not limited to earnings history, projected future outcomes, industry and market trends and the nature of each of the deferred tax assets in assessing the extent to which a valuation allowance should be applied against our U.S. and foreign deferred tax assets.

Our IT Operations Management (“ITOM”) products are generally priced on a subscription unit basis, which allows us to measure customers’ management of various IT resources, and decreasingly on a per node (physical or virtual server) basis. Professional services and other revenues increased by $31 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the prior year, due to an increase in services and trainings provided to new and existing customers. We expect professional services and other revenues for the year ending December 31, 2023 to decrease in absolute dollars and to decrease slightly as a percentage of revenue compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. We continue to be focused on deploying our internal professional services organization as a strategic resource and working with our partner ecosystem to contract directly with customers for implementation services delivery.Cost of Revenues and Gross Profit Percentage Year Ended December 31,% Change 20222021 (dollars in millions) Cost of revenues:Subscription$1,187 $1,022 16 %Professional services and other386 331 17 %Total cost of revenues$1,573 $1,353 16 %Gross profit percentage:Subscription83 %82 %Professional services and other(9)%(2)%Total gross profit percentage78 %77 %Gross profit:$5,672 $4,543 25 %37Table of ContentsCost of subscription revenues increased by $165 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the prior year, primarily due to increased headcount and increased costs to support the growth of our subscription offerings including costs to support customers in regulated markets. Personnel-related costs including stock-based compensation and overhead expenses increased by $142 million as compared to prior year. Maintenance costs to support the expansion of our data center capacity, including public cloud service costs, increased by $46 million and amortization of intangible assets increased by $8 million as a result of recent acquisitions as compared to the prior year. Depreciation expense related to data center hardware and software decreased by $45 million, primarily due to the change in estimated useful life of data center equipment from three years to four years, for the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared to prior year.We expect our cost of subscription revenues for the year ending December 31, 2023 to increase in absolute dollars as we provide subscription services to more customers and increase usage within our customer instances and to increase slightly as a percentage of revenue compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. We will continue to incur incremental costs to attract customers in regulated markets by adopting public cloud offerings as well as increased support for customers impacted by new and evolving data residency requirements. To the extent future acquisitions are consummated, our cost of subscription revenues may increase due to additional non-cash charges associated with the amortization of intangible assets acquired. Our subscription gross profit percentage was 83% and 82% for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. We expect our subscription gross profit percentage to decrease slightly for the year ending December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022.Cost of professional services and other revenues increased by $55 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the prior year. The increase was primarily due to increased headcount to support growth resulting in an increase in personnel-related costs including stock-based compensation, travel and overhead expenses.Our professional services and other gross loss percentage increased to 9% for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 2% in the prior year, primarily driven by planned increase in headcount costs to support the business growth, increase in travel expense for customer implementations and investment in strategic initiatives. We expect our professional services and other gross loss percentage to increase for the year ending December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022.Sales and Marketing Year Ended December 31,% Change 20222021 (dollars in millions) Sales and marketing$2,814 $2,292 23 %Percentage of revenues39 %39 %Sales and marketing expenses increased by $522 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the prior year, primarily due to increased headcount resulting in an increase in personnel-related costs including stock-based compensation and overhead expenses of $411 million, compared to the prior year. Amortization expenses associated with deferred commissions increased by $68 million, compared to the prior year, due to an increase in contracts with new customers, expansion and renewal contracts. Other sales and marketing program expenses, which include branding, costs associated with purchasing advertising, marketing events and market data, increased by $33 million compared to the prior year, primarily due to increased program costs and travel for our annual Knowledge user conference. We expect sales and marketing expenses for the year ending December 31, 2023 to increase in absolute dollars and to decrease slightly as a percentage of revenue compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, as we continue to see leverage from increased sales productivity and marketing efficiencies offset by growth in our international operations in 2023.Research and Development Year Ended December 31,% Change 20222021 (dollars in millions) Research and development$1,768 $1,397 27 %Percentage of revenues24 %24 %38Table of ContentsResearch and development expenses (“R&D”) increased by $371 million during the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the prior year, primarily due to increased headcount resulting in an increase in personnel-related costs including stock-based compensation and overhead expenses of $363 million compared to prior year. We expect R&D expenses for the year ending December 31, 2023 to increase in absolute dollars, but remain relatively flat as a percentage of revenue compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, as we continue to improve the existing functionality of our services, develop new applications to fill market needs and enhance our core platform.General and Administrative Year Ended December 31,% Change 20222021 (dollars in millions) General and administrative$735 $597 23 %Percentage of revenues10 %10 %General and administrative expenses (“G&A”) increased by $138 million during the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the prior year, primarily due to increased headcount resulting in an increase in personnel-related costs including stock-based compensation and overhead expenses of $142 million. We expect G&A expenses for the year ending December 31, 2023 to increase in absolute dollars but remain relatively flat as a percentage of revenue compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, as we continue to see leverage from continued G&A productivity.

Stock-based compensation is inherently difficult to forecast due to fluctuations in our stock price. Based upon our stock price as of December 31, 2022, we expect stock-based compensation to continue to increase in absolute dollars for the year ending December 31, 2023 as we continue to issue stock-based awards to our employees, but decrease slightly as a percentage of revenue compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. We expect stock-based compensation as a percentage of revenue to decline over time as we continue to grow.39Table of ContentsForeign Currency ExchangeOur international operations have provided and will continue to provide a significant portion of our total revenues. Revenues outside North America represented 35% and 36% of total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Because we primarily transact in foreign currencies for sales outside of the United States, the general strengthening of the U.S. Dollar relative to other major foreign currencies (primarily the Euro and British Pound Sterling) during the year ended December 31, 2022 had an unfavorable impact on our revenues. For entities reporting in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar, if we had translated our results for the year ended December 31, 2022 at the exchange rates in effect for the year ended December 31, 2021 rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the period, our reported subscription revenues and professional services and other revenues would have been $274 million and $19 million higher for the year ended December 31, 2022, respectively.In addition, because we primarily transact in foreign currencies for cost of revenues and operating expenses outside of the United States, the general strengthening of the U.S. Dollar relative to other major foreign currencies had a favorable impact on our cost of revenue, sales and marketing expense and R&D expenses during the year ended December 31, 2022. For entities reporting in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar, if we had translated our results for the year ended December 31, 2022 at the exchange rates in effect for the year ended December 31, 2021 rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the period, our reported cost of revenues, sales and marketing and R&D expenses would have been $48 million, $78 million and $19 million higher for the year ended December 31, 2022, respectively. The impact from the foreign currency movements from the year ended December 31, 2021 to the year ended December 31, 2022 was not material to G&A expenses.Interest ExpenseYear Ended December 31,% Change20222021(dollars in millions)Interest expense$(27)$(28)(4 %)Percentage of revenues— %— %Interest expense decreased during the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the prior year.

These hedging contracts may reduce, but cannot entirely eliminate, the impact of adverse currency exchange rate movements. The gains (losses) recognized for these foreign currency forward contracts in other income (expense), net were immaterial for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. 40Table of ContentsProvision for Income Taxes Year Ended December 31,% Change 20222021 (dollars in millions) Income before income taxes$399 $249 60 %Provision for income taxes74 19 289 %Effective tax rate19 %8 %138 % Our effective tax rate was 19% and 8% for the year ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. The difference in rates was primarily attributable to revaluation of our deferred taxes to account for a change in United Kingdom tax rate and a partial valuation allowance related to acquired Lightstep, Inc. deferred tax liabilities in the year ended December 31, 2021. The income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2022 was primarily attributable to the mix of earnings and losses in foreign jurisdictions with differing tax rates, state tax expense and the valuation allowance in the United States.We continue to maintain a full valuation allowance on our U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets and the significant components of the tax expense recorded are current cash taxes payable in various jurisdictions. The cash tax expenses are impacted by each jurisdiction’s individual tax rates, laws on timing of recognition of income and deductions, and availability of net operating losses and tax credits. Given the full valuation allowance on our U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets, sensitivity of current cash taxes to local rules and our foreign structuring, we expect that our effective tax rate could fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis and could be adversely affected to the extent earnings are lower than anticipated in countries that have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher statutory rates. To the extent sufficient positive evidence becomes available, we may release all or a portion of our valuation allowance in one or more future periods. A release of the valuation allowance, if any, would result in the recognition of certain deferred tax assets and a material income tax benefit for the period in which such release is recorded.See Note 16– Income Taxes, in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for our reconciliation of income taxes at the statutory federal rate to the provision for income taxes.Liquidity and Capital Resources We generate cash inflows from operations primarily from selling subscription services which are generally paid in advance of provisioning services, and cash outflows to develop new services and core technologies that further enhance the Now Platform, engage our customer and enhance their experience, and enable and transform our business operations. Subscription services arrangements typically have a three-year duration, and we have experienced a renewal rate of 98% for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. Cash outflows from operations are principally comprised of the salaries, bonuses, commissions, and benefits for our workforce; licenses and services arrangements that are integral to our business operations and data centers; and operating lease arrangements that underlie our facilities. We have generated positive operating cash flows for more than ten years as we continue to grow our business in pursuit of our business strategy, and we expect to grow our business and generate positive cash flows from operations during 2023. When assessing sources of liquidity, we also include cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and long-term investments totaling $6.4 billion as of December 31, 2022.Our working capital requirements are principally comprised of non-contract workforce salaries, bonuses, commissions, and benefits and, to a lesser extent, cancellable and non-cancelable licenses and services arrangements that are integral to our business operations, and operating lease obligations. In addition, we made the payment for the investment in Celonis SE of $100 million during the year ended December 31, 2022. Non-cancelable purchase commitments for business operations total $1,271 million as of December 31, 2022, due primarily over the next five years. Operating lease obligations totaling $895 million are principally associated with leased facilities and have varying maturities with $467 million due over the next five years.41Table of ContentsTo grow our business, we also invest in capital and other resources to expand our data centers and enable our workforce, and we acquire technology and businesses to supplement our technology portfolio. Our capital expenditures are typically under cancelable arrangements primarily used to support the installed base and growth of our hosted business. We have also issued long-term debt to finance our business. In August 2020, we issued 1.40% fixed rate ten-year notes with an aggregate principal amount of $1.5 billion due on September 1, 2030 (the “2030 Notes”). In May and June 2017, we issued the 2022 Notes with an aggregate principal amount of $782.5 million. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we paid cash to settle $94 million in principal of the 2022 Notes, which was comprised of early conversions of $6 million and remaining principal of $88 million for final settlement on June 1, 2022, the maturity date of our 2022 Notes.Our free cash flows, together with our other sources of liquidity, are available to service our liabilities as well as our cancellable and non-cancellable arrangements. We anticipate cash flows generated from operations, cash, cash equivalents and investments will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for at least the next 12 months. As we look beyond the next 12 months, we seek to continue to grow free cash flows necessary to fund our operations and grow our business. If we require additional capital resources, we may seek to finance our operations from the current funds available or additional equity or debt financing.

The net increase in operating cash flow was primarily due to higher collections driven by revenue growth. Investing ActivitiesNet cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 was $2.6 billion compared to $1.6 billion for the prior year. The net increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to a $1,427 million increase in net purchases of investments, a $96 million increase in non-marketable investments mainly in Celonis SE and a $158 million increase in purchases of property and equipment, offset by a $694 million decrease in business combinations.Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 was $344 million compared to $506 million for the prior year. The net decrease in cash used in financing activities is primarily due to a $185 million decrease in taxes paid related to net share settlement of equity awards, a $10 million increase in proceeds from employee stock plans, offset by a $33 million increase in repayments of convertible senior notes attributable to principal.Contractual Obligations and CommitmentsOur estimated future obligations consist of leases, a non-cancelable $500 million agreement with Microsoft to purchase cloud services over five years for accelerating the Azure adoption for mutual customers, purchase obligations, debt and unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2022. Refer to Note 17 “Commitments and Contingencies” to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information.42Table of ContentsITEM 7A.QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKForeign Currency Exchange RiskWe have foreign currency risks related to our revenue and operating expenses denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar, primarily the Euro and British Pound Sterling. We are a net receiver of Euro and British Pound Sterling, and therefore benefit from a weakening of the U.S. Dollar relative to these currencies and, conversely, are adversely affected by a strengthening of the U.S. Dollar relative to these currencies. Revenues denominated in U.S. Dollar as a percentage of total revenues was 72%, 70% and 71% for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. A hypothetical 10% increase in the U.S. Dollar against other currencies would have resulted in a decrease in operating income of $75 million, $62 million and $47 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. This analysis disregards the possibilities that rates can move in opposite directions and that losses from one geographic area may be offset by gains from another geographic area.To mitigate our risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, we enter into foreign currency derivative contracts to hedge a portion of our net outstanding monetary assets and liabilities. These derivative contracts are intended to offset gains or losses related to remeasuring monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entities in which they are recorded.These derivative contracts expose us to credit risk to the extent that the counterparties may be unable to meet the terms of the arrangement. We mitigate this credit risk by transacting with major financial institutions with high credit ratings and entering into master netting arrangements, which permit net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty. While the contract or notional amount is often used to express the volume of foreign currency derivative contracts, the amounts potentially subject to credit risk are generally limited to the amounts, if any, by which the counterparties’ obligations under the agreements exceed our obligations to the counterparties. We are not required to pledge, and are not entitled to receive, cash collateral related to these derivative instruments. We do not enter into derivative contracts for trading or speculative purposes. Refer to Note 8 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. Interest Rate Sensitivity We had an aggregate of $6.4 billion in cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and long-term investments as of December 31, 2022. This amount was invested primarily in money market funds, certificates of deposit, corporate notes and bonds, government and agency securities and other debt securities with a minimum rating of BBB by Standard & Poor’s, Baa2 by Moody’s or BBB by Fitch. The primary objectives of our investment activities are the preservation of capital and support of our liquidity requirements. Our investments are exposed to market risk due to fluctuations in interest rates, which may affect our interest income and the fair market value of our investments. As of December 31, 2022, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would have resulted in an approximate $39 million decline of the fair value of our available-for-sale securities. This estimate is based on a sensitivity model that measures market value changes when changes in interest rates occur.As of December 31, 2021, we had an aggregate of $4.9 billion in cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and long-term investments, and a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would have resulted in an approximate $30 million decline of the fair value of our available-for-sale securities. 43Table of ContentsMarket RiskIn August 2020, we issued 1.40% fixed rate ten-year notes with an aggregate principal amount of $1.5 billion due on September 1, 2030. The 2030 Notes were issued at 99.63% of principal and we incurred approximately $13 million of debt issuance costs. Interest is payable semi-annually in arrears on March 1 and September 1 of each year, beginning on March 1, 2021, and the entire outstanding principal amount is due at maturity on September 1, 2030. The 2030 Notes are unsecured obligations and the indentures governing the 2030 Notes contain customary events of default and covenants that, among others and subject to exceptions, restrict the Company’s ability to incur or guarantee debt secured by liens on specified assets or enter into sale and lease-back transactions with respect to specified properties. In May and June 2017, we issued the 2022 Notes with an aggregate principal amount of $782.5 million. These 2022 Notes were recorded at face value less unamortized discount on our consolidated balance sheet. Because these instruments do not bear interest, we had no economic interest rate exposure associated with changes in interest rates. However, the fair value of our 2022 Notes was exposed to interest rate risks. In addition, the fair value of the 2022 Notes was affected by our stock price due to the conversion feature and would generally increase as the stock price increases. The remaining principal of 2022 Notes was settled on June 1, 2022. We hold cash balances with multiple financial institutions in various countries and these balances routinely exceed deposit insurance limits.As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had $252 million and $99 million, respectively, of non-marketable equity investments in privately held companies. Recording upward and downward adjustments to the carrying value of our non-marketable equity investments requires quantitative assessments of the fair value of our non-marketable equity investments using various valuation methodologies and involves the use of estimates. The timing and amount of observable price changes are influenced by market dynamics that can impact the valuation of our non-marketable equity investments. These changes could be material based on market conditions and events.44Table of Contents",2023-12-30 18:26:33.397817
