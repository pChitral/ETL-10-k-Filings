97476,TXN,TEXAS INSTRUMENTS INC,2015,"ITEM 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.OverviewWe design, make and sell semiconductors to electronics designers and manufacturers all over the world. Our business model is carefully constructed around several advantages that are unique to TI:•Industry’s broadest portfolio of differentiated analog and embedded processing semiconductors. Our customers’ design engineers need at least one, and most times multiple, chips for their systems. The breadth of our portfolio means we can solve more of these needs than can our competitors, which gives us access to more customers and the opportunity to generate more revenue per system. We invest more than $1 billion each year to develop new products for our portfolio.•A strong foundation of manufacturing technology and low-cost production. We invest in manufacturing technologies that differentiate the features of our semiconductors, and we do most of our own production in-house as opposed to outsourcing it. This ability to directly control our manufacturing helps ensure a consistent supply of products for our customers. We produce billions of semiconductors each year on a mixture of 150-, 200- and 300-millimeter wafers, and we are able to keep costs low for manufacturing facilities and equipment because our analog and much of our embedded processing semiconductors can be made using mature assets that we acquire ahead of demand when their prices are most attractive. In 2014 we produced approximately 25 percent of our Analog semiconductors on 300-millimeter wafers, the industry’s largest wafers, which have a 40 percent cost advantage per unpackaged chip over 200-millimeter wafers. The majority of our future Analog growth will be produced on 300-millimeter wafers, which will be meaningful to the growth of our margins and cash flow over the long term.•Industry’s largest market channels. Our global sales force is larger than those of our competitors, and the breadth of our portfolio attracts tens of millions of visits to our web site each year where customers often begin their initial product searches and design-in journey. These capabilities combine to provide us unique access to more than 100,000 customers.•Diversity and longevity in our products and in the markets we serve. Together, the advantages above result in diverse and long-lived positions that deliver high terminal value to our shareholders. Because of the breadth of our portfolio we are not dependent on any single product, and because of the breadth of our markets we are not dependent on any single application or customer. Some of our products generate revenue for decades, which strengthens the return on our investments.These advantages have resulted in consistent share gains and free cash flow growth, and they put us in a unique class of companies with the ability to grow, generate cash, and return that cash to shareholders. Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (MD&A) should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this document. In the following discussion of our results of operations:•All dollar amounts in the tables are stated in millions of U.S. dollars, except per-share amounts.•When we discuss our results:◦Unless otherwise noted, changes in our revenue are attributable to changes in customer demand, which are evidenced by fluctuations in shipment volumes. ◦New products tend not to have a significant impact on our revenue in any given period because we sell such a large number of products.◦From time to time, our revenue and gross profit are affected by changes in demand for higher-priced or lower-priced products, which we refer to as changes in the “mix” of products shipped.◦Because we own much of our manufacturing capacity, a significant portion of our operating cost is fixed. When factory loadings decrease, our fixed costs are spread over reduced output and, absent other circumstances, our profit margins decrease. Conversely, as factory loadings increase, our fixed costs are spread over increased output and, absent other circumstances, our profit margins increase. Increases and decreases in factory loadings tend to correspond to increases and decreases in demand.17•Our segments represent groups of similar products that are combined on the basis of similar design and development requirements, product characteristics, manufacturing processes and distribution channels, and how management allocates resources and measures results. See Note 1 to the financial statements for more information regarding our segments.•Our exit from legacy wireless products and the elimination (effective January 1, 2013) of the Wireless segment resulted in changes to our corporate-level expense allocations, which negatively affected Analog and Embedded Processing profitability in the year ended December 31, 2013 and, to a less significant extent, in 2014. We allocate our corporate-level expenses, which are largely fixed, among our product lines in proportion to the operating expenses directly generated by them. Legacy wireless products generated lower operating expenses in 2014 and 2013 than in 2012 because we stopped investing in them. The corporate-level expenses allocated to those products were, therefore, proportionately lower, and the corporate-level expenses allocated to the remaining product lines were proportionately higher. This allocation change affects the profitability of each of our segments, but does not impact operating expense or profitability trends at the consolidated level.Results of operationsWe continued to perform well in 2014, reflecting our focus on Analog and Embedded Processing semiconductors. We believe these products serve highly diverse markets with thousands of applications and have dependable long-term growth opportunities. In 2014, Analog revenue grew 13 percent and Embedded Processing revenue grew 12 percent. These two segments represented 83 percent of TI revenue for the year, up from 79 percent in 2013. Gross margin of 56.9 percent for the year reflects the diversity and longevity of our product portfolio, as well as the efficiency of our manufacturing strategy. Our business model focused on Analog and Embedded Processing allows us to generate strong cash flow from operations. In 2014, free cash flow was 27 percent of revenue, up 3 percentage points from a year ago. During the year, we returned $4.2 billion of cash to investors through a combination of stock repurchases and dividends.Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure. For a reconciliation to GAAP and an explanation of the reason for providing this non-GAAP measure, see the Non-GAAP financial information section after the Liquidity and capital resources section.Details of financial results – 2014 compared with 2013Revenue was $13.05 billion, up $840 million, or 7 percent, from 2013 due to higher revenue from Analog and Embedded Processing. These increases more than offset lower revenue from legacy wireless products.Gross profit was $7.43 billion, an increase of $1.06 billion, or 17 percent, from 2013 primarily due to higher revenue and, to a lesser extent, a more favorable mix of products shipped. Gross profit margin was 56.9 percent of revenue compared with 52.1 percent in 2013. Operating expenses were $1.36 billion for R&D and $1.84 billion for SG&A. R&D expense decreased $164 million, or 11 percent, from 2013 primarily due to savings from ongoing efforts across the company to align costs with growth opportunities, including the previously announced wind-down of our legacy wireless products and restructuring actions in Embedded Processing and Japan. R&D expense as a percent of revenue was 10.4 percent compared with 12.5 percent in 2013. SG&A expense was about even, as higher variable compensation costs were offset by savings from our cost alignment efforts. SG&A expense as a percent of revenue was 14.1 percent compared with 15.2 percent in 2013. Acquisition charges were related to our 2011 acquisition of National Semiconductor and were $330 million compared with $341 million in 2013. The charges were primarily from the amortization of intangible assets. See Note 3 to the financial statements for detailed information.Restructuring charges/other was a net credit of $51 million, which included gains on sales of assets of $75 million, partially offset by restructuring charges and other expenses of $24 million. This compared with a net credit of $189 million in 2013, reflecting a $315 million gain from our transfer of wireless connectivity technology to a customer, partially offset by restructuring charges of $126 million. These amounts are included in Other for segment reporting purposes. For details on the types of costs incurred and the amounts associated with each restructuring action, see Note 4 to the financial statements.Operating profit was $3.95 billion, or 30.3 percent of revenue, compared with $2.83 billion, or 23.2 percent, in 2013. 18The income tax provision was $1.05 billion compared with $592 million in 2013. The increase in the total tax provision was due to higher income before income taxes and, to a lesser extent, the effect of the retroactive reinstatement of the federal research tax credit for 2012 in 2013. Our annual effective tax rates were 27 percent in 2014 and 24 percent in 2013. The federal research tax credit included in the annual effective tax rates for 2014 and 2013 expired at the end of 2014. See Note 7 to the financial statements for a reconciliation of the income tax provision to the statutory federal tax.Our annual effective tax rate benefits from lower rates (compared to the U.S. statutory rate) applicable to our operations in many of the jurisdictions in which we operate and from U.S. tax benefits. These lower non-U.S. tax rates are generally statutory in nature, without expiration and available to companies that operate in those taxing jurisdictions. We benefit to a lesser extent from tax holidays in non-U.S. jurisdictions, in particular, Malaysia and the Philippines. Pre-tax income related to assembly/test manufacturing facilities in those jurisdictions is included in the non-U.S. effective tax rates reconciling item. Net income was $2.82 billion, an increase of $659 million, or 30 percent, from 2013. EPS was $2.57 compared with $1.91 in 2013. EPS benefited $0.07 from 2013 due to a lower number of average shares outstanding as a result of our stock repurchase program.Segment results – 2014 compared with 2013Analog (includes High Volume Analog & Logic, Power Management, High Performance Analog and Silicon Valley Analog product lines) 2014 2013 ChangeRevenue $8,104 $7,194 13%Operating profit 2,786 1,859 50%Operating profit % of revenue 34.4% 25.8% Analog revenue increased in all products lines. Revenue from Power grew the most, followed by revenue from, in decreasing order, HPA, HVAL and SVA. Operating profit increased primarily due to higher revenue and associated gross profit.Embedded Processing (includes Processor, Microcontrollers and Connectivity product lines) 2014 2013 ChangeRevenue $2,740 $2,450 12%Operating profit 384 185 108%Operating profit % of revenue 14.0% 7.6% Embedded Processing revenue increased primarily due to Microcontrollers and Processor, which contributed about equally to the increase. Connectivity increased to a lesser extent. Revenue from Processor increased as a result of a more favorable mix of products shipped. Operating profit increased primarily due to higher revenue and associated gross profit.Other (includes DLP products, custom ASIC products, calculators, royalties and legacy wireless products) 2014 2013 ChangeRevenue $2,201 $2,561 -14%Operating profit* 777 788 -1%Operating profit % of revenue 35.3% 30.8% *Includes Acquisition charges and Restructuring charges/otherOther revenue decreased due to legacy wireless products. Operating profit was about even as reductions in operating expenses were offset by changes in Restructuring charges/other. See Note 4 to the financial statements for information regarding Restructuring charges/other.Prior results of operationsOur performance in 2013 was strong, reflecting our increased focus on Analog and Embedded Processing. During 2013, 79 percent of our revenue came from Analog and Embedded Processing, with Analog revenue increasing 3 percent from 2012 and Embedded Processing revenue increasing 9 percent from 2012. Operating margin for Analog was 25.8 percent, and it exceeded 1930 percent during the second half of 2013. Operating margin for Embedded Processing was 7.6 percent. Additionally, we completed our exit from legacy wireless products. Our business model continued to generate strong cash flow from operations, with free cash flow for 2013 of $3 billion, or 24 percent of revenue. During 2013 we returned over $4 billion of cash to investors through a combination of stock repurchases and dividends.Details of financial results – 2013 compared with 2012Revenue was $12.20 billion, down $620 million, or 5 percent, from 2012 due to lower revenue from legacy wireless products. Despite the decline in overall revenue, gross profit of $6.36 billion was about even with 2012 due to a more favorable mix of products shipped and, to a lesser extent, lower manufacturing costs. Gross profit margin was 52.1 percent of revenue compared with 49.6 percent in 2012. Operating expenses were $1.52 billion for R&D and $1.86 billion for SG&A. R&D expense decreased $355 million, or 19 percent, from 2012 primarily reflecting the wind-down of our legacy wireless products. R&D expense as a percent of revenue was 12.5 percent compared with 14.6 percent in 2012. SG&A expense increased $54 million, or 3 percent, from 2012 primarily due to higher variable compensation and other support costs, partially offset by reduced costs from the wind-down of our legacy wireless products. SG&A expense as a percent of revenue was 15.2 percent compared with 14.1 percent in 2012. Acquisition charges were related to our 2011 acquisition of National and were $341 million in 2013 compared with $450 million in 2012. The charges were primarily from the amortization of intangible assets. The decrease from 2012 was due to the nonrecurrence of integration-related expenses. Restructuring charges/other was a net credit of $189 million, reflecting the $315 million gain from the technology transfer, partially offset by restructuring charges of $126 million. This compared with a net charge of $264 million in 2012, which included restructuring and other charges of $408 million, partially offset by a $144 million gain from the transfer of the obligations and assets of a portion of our Japan pension program from the pension trust to the government of Japan. These net amounts are all included in Other. For details on restructuring actions, see Note 4 to the financial statements.Operating profit was $2.83 billion, or 23.2 percent of revenue, compared with $1.97 billion, or 15.4 percent of revenue, in 2012. The income tax provision was $592 million compared with $176 million for 2012. The increase in the total tax provision was due to higher income before income taxes and, to a lesser extent, lower discrete tax benefits. The discrete tax benefits were $79 million in 2013, primarily due to the effect of the reinstatement of the federal research tax credit for 2012. In 2012, the discrete tax benefits were $252 million, primarily due to additional U.S. tax benefits for manufacturing related to prior years. Our annual effective tax rates were 24 percent in 2013 and 22 percent in 2012. Net income was $2.16 billion, an increase of $403 million, or 23 percent, from 2012. EPS was $1.91 compared with $1.51 for 2012. EPS benefited $0.06 from 2012 due to a lower number of average shares outstanding as a result of our stock repurchase program.Segment results– 2013 compared with 2012Analog 2013 2012 ChangeRevenue $7,194 $6,998 3%Operating profit 1,859 1,650 13%Operating profit % of revenue 25.8% 23.6% Analog revenue increased primarily due to growth in Power. Revenue from SVA and HPA also increased, but to a lesser extent. HVAL revenue decreased primarily due to a less favorable mix of products shipped. Operating profit increased primarily due to higher gross profit that benefited from higher revenue and lower manufacturing costs. This increase in gross profit was partially offset by higher operating expenses.20Embedded Processing 2013 2012 ChangeRevenue $2,450 $2,257 9%Operating profit 185 158 17%Operating profit % of revenue 7.6% 7.0% Embedded Processing revenue increased primarily due to higher revenue from Microcontrollers, and to a lesser extent, Processor and Connectivity.

Operating profit from Other increased due to lower operating expenses and Restructuring charges/other. These decreases were partially offset by lower revenue and associated gross profit.Financial conditionAt the end of 2014, total cash (Cash and cash equivalents plus Short-term investments) was $3.54 billion, a decrease of $288 million from the end of 2013.Accounts receivable were $1.25 billion at the end of 2014. This was an increase of $43 million compared with the end of 2013 due to higher revenue. Days sales outstanding were 34 at the end of 2014 compared with 36 at the end of 2013.Inventory was $1.78 billion at the end of 2014. This was an increase of $53 million from the end of 2013. Days of inventory at the end of 2014 were 117 compared with 112 at the end of 2013. As sales to distributors become a larger portion of our revenue, we expect consignment inventory to become a larger portion of our total inventory. This may lead to changes in the level of inventory we carry in the future.Liquidity and capital resourcesOur primary source of liquidity is cash flow from operations. Additional sources of liquidity are Cash and cash equivalents, Short-term investments and revolving credit facilities. Cash flow from operating activities for 2014 was $3.89 billion, an increase of $508 million from 2013 due to an increase in Net income.We had $1.20 billion of Cash and cash equivalents and $2.34 billion of Short-term investments as of December 31, 2014. Our U.S. entities owned 82 percent of total cash at the end of 2014.We have a variable-rate revolving credit facility with a consortium of investment-grade banks that allows us to borrow up to $2 billion until March 2019. This credit facility also serves as support for the issuance of commercial paper. As of December 31, 2014, our credit facility was undrawn and we had no commercial paper outstanding.In 2014, investing activities used $377 million compared with $3 million in 2013. For 2014, Capital expenditures were $385 million compared with $412 million in 2013. Capital expenditures in both periods were primarily for semiconductor manufacturing equipment. In 2014, we had purchases of short-term investments, net of sales, that used cash of $141 million. In comparison, in 2013, we had sales of short-term investments, net of purchases, that provided cash proceeds of $342 million. In addition, we had proceeds from sales of assets of $142 million in 2014 compared with $21 million in 2013.21In 2014, financing activities used net cash of $3.94 billion compared with $3.17 billion in 2013. In 2014, we received proceeds of $498 million from the issuance of fixed-rate long-term debt (net of original issuance discount) and repaid $1.00 billion of maturing debt. In 2013, we received proceeds of $986 million from the issuance of fixed-rate long-term debt (net of original issuance discount) and repaid $1.50 billion of maturing debt. Dividends paid in 2014 were $1.32 billion compared with $1.18 billion in 2013, reflecting increases in the dividend rate. During 2014, the quarterly dividend increased from $0.30 to $0.34 per share, resulting in an annualized dividend payment of $1.36 per share. In 2013, we announced two increases in our quarterly dividend, increasing from $0.21 to $0.30 per share. In 2014, we used $2.83 billion to repurchase 61.7 million shares of our common stock. This compared with $2.87 billion used in 2013 to repurchase 77.6 million shares. Employee exercises of stock options are also reflected in Cash flows from financing activities. In 2014, these exercises provided cash proceeds of $616 million compared with $1.31 billion in 2013. Stock option exercises in 2013 were higher than historical averages.We believe we have the necessary financial resources and operating plans to fund our working capital needs, capital expenditures, dividend and debt-related payments, and other business requirements for at least the next 12 months.Non-GAAP financial informationThis MD&A includes references to free cash flow and ratios based on that measure. These are financial measures that were not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP). Free cash flow was calculated by subtracting Capital expenditures from the most directly comparable GAAP measure, Cash flows from operating activities (also referred to as cash flow from operations). We believe that free cash flow and the associated ratios provide insight into our liquidity, our cash-generating capability and the amount of cash potentially available to return to investors, as well as insight into our financial performance. These non-GAAP measures are supplemental to the comparable GAAP measures. Reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP-based measures is provided in the table below. For Years Ended December 31, 2014 2013Cash flow from operations (GAAP) $3,892 $3,384Capital expenditures (385) (412)Free cash flow (non-GAAP) $3,507 $2,972 Revenue $13,045 $12,205 Cash flow from operations as a percent of revenue (GAAP) 30% 28%Free cash flow as a percent of revenue (non-GAAP) 27% 24%22Long-term contractual obligations Payments Due by PeriodContractual Obligations 2015 2016/2017 2018/2019 Thereafter TotalLong-term debt obligations (a) $1,000 $1,625 $1,250 $750 $4,625Operating lease obligations (b) 87 111 54 80 332Software license obligations (c) 39 27 — — 66Purchase obligations (d) 96 87 24 2 209Deferred compensation plan (e) 16 40 32 80 168Total (f) $1,238 $1,890 $1,360 $912 $5,400 (a) Includes amounts classified as the current portion of long-term debt, specifically obligations that will mature within 12 months. The related interest payments are not included. (b) Includes minimum payments for leased facilities and equipment and purchases of industrial gases under contracts accounted for as operating leases. (c) Includes payments under license agreements for electronic design automation software. (d) Includes contractual arrangements with suppliers where there is a fixed, non-cancellable payment schedule or minimum payments due with a reduced delivery schedule. Excluded from the table are cancellable arrangements. However, depending on when certain purchase arrangements may be cancelled, an additional $2 million of cancellation penalties may be required to be paid, which are not reflected in the table. (e) Includes an estimate of payments under this plan for the liability that existed at December 31, 2014. (f) Excluded from the table are $108 million of uncertain tax liabilities under ASC 740, as well as any planned future funding contributions to retirement benefit plans. Amounts associated with uncertain tax liabilities have been excluded because of the difficulty in making reasonably reliable estimates of the timing of cash settlements with the respective taxing authorities. Regarding future funding of retirement benefit plans, we plan to contribute about $100 million in 2015, but funding projections beyond 2015 are not practical to estimate due to the rules affecting tax-deductible contributions and the impact from the plans' asset performance, interest rates and potential U.S. and non-U.S. legislation. Critical accounting policiesIn preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, we use statistical analyses, estimates and projections that affect the reported amounts and related disclosures and may vary from actual results. We consider the following accounting policies to be both those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and that require the most subjective judgment. If actual results differ significantly from management’s estimates and projections, there could be a significant effect on our financial statements.Revenue recognitionWe recognize revenue from sales of our products, including direct sales to our distributors, when title and risk of loss pass, which usually occurs upon shipment or delivery to the customer or distributor, depending upon the terms of the sales order; when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; when sales amounts are fixed or determinable; and when collectability is reasonably assured. For sales to distributors, payment is due on our standard commercial terms and is not contingent upon resale of the products. In 2014, about 60 percent of our revenue was generated from sales of our products to distributors.We recognize revenue net of allowances, which are management’s estimates of future credits to be granted to customers or distributors under programs common in the semiconductor industry. These allowances are based on analysis of historical data, current economic conditions, and contractual terms and are recorded when revenue is recognized. Allowances may include volume-based incentives, product returns due to quality issues, incentives designed to maximize growth opportunities and special pricing arrangements. For instance, we sell to distributors at standard published prices, but we may grant them price adjustment credits in response to individual competitive opportunities. To estimate allowances, we use statistical percentages of revenue, which are determined quarterly based upon recent historical adjustment trends. Historical claims data are maintained for each of the programs, with differences among geographic regions taken into consideration. We continually monitor the actual claimed allowances against our estimates, and we adjust our estimates as appropriate to reflect trends in distributor revenue and inventory levels. Allowances are also adjusted when recent historical data do not represent anticipated future activity. We may also provide distributors an allowance to scrap certain slow-selling or obsolete products in their inventory, estimated as a negotiated fixed percentage of each distributor’s purchases from us. In addition, if we publish a new price for a product that is lower than that paid by distributors for the same product still remaining in each distributor’s on-hand inventory, we may credit 23them for the difference between those prices. The allowance for this type of credit is based on the identified product price difference applied to our estimate of each distributor’s on-hand inventory of that product.We believe we can reasonably and reliably estimate allowances for credits to distributors in a timely manner. Revenue from sales of our products that are subject to inventory consignment agreements, including consignment arrangements with distributors, is recognized in accordance with the principles discussed above, but delivery occurs when the customer or distributor pulls product from consignment inventory that we store at designated locations. About 60 percent of our distributor revenue is generated from sales of consigned inventory. The allowances we record against this revenue are not material.We determine the amount and timing of royalty revenue based on our contractual agreements with intellectual property licensees. We recognize royalty revenue when earned under the terms of the agreements and when we consider realization of payment to be probable. In addition, we record allowances for accounts receivable that we estimate may not be collected. We monitor collectability of accounts receivable primarily through review of the accounts receivable aging. When collection is at risk, we assess the impact on amounts recorded for bad debts and, if necessary, will record a charge in the period such determination is made. We include amounts received from customers for reimbursement of shipping fees in revenue. We include the costs of shipping and handling in COR. Income taxesIn determining Net income for financial statement purposes, we must make certain estimates and judgments in the calculation of tax provisions and the resultant tax liabilities, and in the recoverability of deferred tax assets that arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense.In the ordinary course of global business, there may be many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. The calculation of tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. We recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on an estimate of the ultimate resolution of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. Although we believe the estimates are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these matters will not be different than what is reflected in the historical income tax provisions and accruals.As part of our financial process, we must assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets can be recovered. If recovery is not likely, the provision for taxes must be increased by recording a reserve in the form of a valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets that are estimated not to be ultimately recoverable. In this process, certain relevant criteria are evaluated including the existence of deferred tax liabilities that can be used to absorb deferred tax assets, the taxable income in prior years that can be used to absorb net operating losses and credit carrybacks, and taxable income in future years. Our judgment regarding future recoverability of our deferred tax assets based on these criteria may change due to various factors, including changes in U.S. or international tax laws and changes in market conditions and their impact on our assessment of taxable income in future periods. These changes, if any, may require material adjustments to the deferred tax assets and an accompanying reduction or increase in Net income in the period when such determinations are made. Also, our plans for the permanent reinvestment or eventual repatriation of the accumulated earnings of certain of our non-U.S. operations could change. Such changes could have a material effect on tax expense in future years. In addition to the factors described above, the effective tax rate reflected in forward-looking statements is based on then-current tax law. Significant changes in tax law enacted during the year could affect these estimates. Retroactive changes in tax law enacted subsequent to the end of a reporting period are reflected in the period of enactment as a discrete tax item. Inventory valuation allowancesInventory is valued net of allowances for unsalable or obsolete raw materials, work-in-process and finished goods. Statistical allowances are determined quarterly for raw materials and work-in-process based on historical disposals of inventory for salability and obsolescence reasons. For finished goods, quarterly statistical allowances are determined by comparing inventory levels of individual parts to historical shipments, current backlog and estimated future sales in order to identify inventory judged unlikely to be sold. A specific allowance for each material type will be carried if there is a significant event not captured by the statistical allowance. Examples are an end-of-life part or demand with imminent risk of cancellation. Allowances are also calculated quarterly for instances where inventoried costs for individual products are in excess of market prices for those products. Actual future write-offs of inventory for salability and obsolescence reasons may differ from estimates and calculations used to determine valuation allowances due to changes in customer demand, customer negotiations, technology shifts and other factors.24Impairment of acquisition-related intangibles and goodwillWe review acquisition-related intangible assets for impairment when certain indicators suggest an asset’s carrying amount may not be recoverable. Factors considered include the asset’s underperformance compared with expectations and shortened useful life due to planned changes in its use. Recoverability is determined by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the estimated future undiscounted cash flow. If the future undiscounted cash flow is less than the carrying amount, an impairment charge would be recognized for the excess of the carrying amount over fair value, determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow technique. Additionally, in the case of an intangible asset that will continue to be used in future periods, a shortened useful life may be utilized if appropriate, resulting in accelerated amortization based upon the expected net realizable value of the asset at the date the asset will no longer be utilized.We review goodwill for impairment annually, or more frequently if certain impairment indicators arise, such as significant changes in business climate, operating performance or competition, or upon the disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit. A significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred between annual test dates. This impairment review compares the fair value for each reporting unit containing goodwill to its carrying value. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including projected future cash flows, discount rates based on weighted average cost of capital and future economic and market conditions. We base our fair-value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable.Actual cash flow amounts for future periods may differ from estimates used in impairment testing.Changes in accounting standardsSee Note 2 to the financial statements for information on new accounting standards.Off-balance sheet arrangementsAs of December 31, 2014, we had no significant off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K.Commitments and contingenciesSee Note 13 to the financial statements for a discussion of our commitments and contingencies.ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.Foreign exchange riskThe U.S. dollar is the functional currency for financial reporting. Our non-U.S. entities own assets or liabilities denominated in U.S. dollars or other currencies. Exchange rate fluctuations can have a significant impact on taxable income in those jurisdictions, and consequently on our effective tax rate.Our balance sheet also reflects amounts remeasured from non-U.S. dollar currencies. Because most of the aggregate non-U.S. dollar balance sheet exposure is hedged by forward currency exchange contracts, based on year-end 2014 balances and currency exchange rates, a hypothetical 10 percent plus or minus fluctuation in non-U.S. currency exchange rates would result in a pre-tax currency exchange gain or loss of less than $1 million.We use these forward currency exchange contracts to reduce the earnings impact exchange rate fluctuations may have on our non-U.S. dollar net balance sheet exposures. For example, at year-end 2014, we had forward currency exchange contracts outstanding with a notional value of $504 million to hedge net balance sheet exposures (including $183 million to sell Japanese yen, $163 million to sell euros and $29 million to sell British pound sterling). Similar hedging activities existed at year-end 2013.Interest rate riskWe have the following potential exposure to changes in interest rates: (1) the effect of changes in interest rates on the fair value of our investments in cash equivalents and short-term investments, which could produce a gain or a loss; and (2) the effect of changes in interest rates on the fair value of our debt.25As of December 31, 2014, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would decrease the fair value of our investments in cash equivalents and short-term investments by $12 million and decrease the fair value of our long-term debt by $128 million. Because interest rates on our long-term debt are fixed, changes in interest rates would not affect the cash flows associated with long-term debt.Equity riskLong-term investments at year-end 2014 include the following:•Investments in mutual funds − includes mutual funds that were selected to generate returns that offset changes in certain liabilities related to deferred compensation arrangements. The mutual funds hold a variety of debt and equity investments.•Investments in venture capital funds − includes investments in limited partnerships (accounted for under either the equity or cost method).•Equity investments − includes non-marketable (non-publicly traded) equity securities.Investments in mutual funds are stated at fair value. Changes in prices of the mutual fund investments are expected to offset related changes in deferred compensation liabilities such that a 10 percent increase or decrease in the investments' fair values would not materially affect operating results. Non-marketable equity securities and some venture capital funds are stated at cost. Impairments deemed to be other-than-temporary are expensed in Net income. Investments in the remaining venture capital funds are stated using the equity method. See Note 9 to the financial statements for details of equity and other long-term investments.26",2023-12-30 17:49:13.104057
97476,TXN,TEXAS INSTRUMENTS INC,2020,"ITEM 7. Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsOverviewWe design, make and sell semiconductors to electronics designers and manufacturers all over the world. For many years, we have run our business with three overarching ambitions in mind. First, we will act like owners who will own the company for decades. Second, we will adapt and succeed in a world that is ever changing. And third, we will be a company that we are personally proud to be a part of and that we would want as our neighbor. When we are successful in achieving these ambitions, our employees, customers, communities and shareholders all win.Our business model is designed around the following four sustainable competitive advantages that we believe, in combination, put us in a unique class of companies:•A strong foundation of manufacturing and technology. We invest in manufacturing technologies and do most of our manufacturing in-house. This strategic decision to directly control our manufacturing helps ensure a consistent supply of products for our customers and also allows us to invest in technology that differentiates the features of our products. We have focused on creating a competitive manufacturing cost advantage by investing in our advanced analog 300-millimeter capacity, which has about a 40% cost advantage per unpackaged chip over 200-millimeter. To strengthen this advantage, we are moving forward with our plan to build our new 300-millimeter wafer fabrication facility in Richardson, Texas, as 300-millimeter wafers will continue to support the majority of our Analog growth.•Broad portfolio of differentiated analog and embedded processing products. Our customers need multiple chips for their systems. The breadth of our portfolio means we can meet more of these needs than our competitors can, which gives us access to more customers and the opportunity to sell more products and generate more revenue per customer system. We invest more than $1 billion each year to develop new products for our portfolio, which includes tens of thousands of products. •Reach of market channels. Customers often begin their initial product selection process and design-in journey on our website, and the breadth of our portfolio attracts more customers to our website than any of our competitors’ websites. Our web presence and global sales and applications team are advantages that give us unique access and insight to about 100,000 customers designing TI semiconductors into their end products. •Diversity and longevity of our products, markets and customer positions. Together, the attributes above result in diverse and long-lived positions that deliver high terminal value to our shareholders. Because of the breadth of our portfolio, we are not dependent on any single product, customer, technology or market. Some of our products generate revenue for decades, which strengthens the return on our investments.Our strategic focus, and where we invest the majority of our resources, is on Analog and Embedded Processing, with a particular emphasis on designing and selling those products into the industrial and automotive markets. We believe these markets represent the best growth opportunities over the next decade or longer, due to increasing semiconductor content. Additionally, analog and embedded processing products sold into industrial and automotive markets provide long product life cycles, intrinsic diversity and less capital-intensive manufacturing, which we believe offer stability, profitability and strong cash generation. This business model is the foundation of our capital management strategy, which is based on our belief that free cash flow growth, especially on a per-share basis, is important for maximizing shareholder value over the long term. We also believe that free cash flow will be valued only if it is productively invested in the business or returned to shareholders.The combined effect of our ambitions, business model and sustainable competitive advantages is that we have continued to build a stronger company. Over time, we have gained market share in Analog and Embedded Processing and grown and returned all free cash flow to our owners.Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (MD&A) should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this document. In the following discussion of our results of operations:•Our segments represent groups of similar products that are combined on the basis of similar design and development requirements, product characteristics, manufacturing processes and distribution channels, and how management allocates resources and measures results. See Note 1 to the financial statements for more information regarding our segments.16•When we discuss our results:◦Unless otherwise noted, changes in our revenue are attributable to changes in customer demand, which are evidenced by fluctuations in shipment volumes.◦New products do not tend to have a significant impact on our revenue in any given period because we sell such a large number of products.◦From time to time, our revenue and gross profit are affected by changes in demand for higher-priced or lower-priced products, which we refer to as changes in the “mix” of products shipped.◦Because we own much of our manufacturing capacity, a significant portion of our operating cost is fixed. When factory loadings decrease, our fixed costs are spread over reduced output and, absent other circumstances, our profit margins decrease. Conversely, as factory loadings increase, our fixed costs are spread over increased output and, absent other circumstances, our profit margins increase. Increases and decreases in factory loadings tend to correspond to increases and decreases in demand.•All dollar amounts in the tables are stated in millions of U.S. dollars.Our results of operations discussed below provides details of our financial results for 2019 and 2018 and year-to-year comparisons between 2019 and 2018. Discussion of 2017 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2018 and 2017 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in “Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in Part II, Item 7 of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.Results of operationsIn 2019, we continued our focus on analog and embedded processing products and the industrial and automotive markets. Together, these products and markets represent highly diverse opportunities with thousands of applications and long-term growth potential. Gross margin of 63.7% reflected the quality of our product portfolio, as well as the efficiency of our manufacturing strategy, including the benefit of 300-millimeter Analog production.Our focus on Analog and Embedded Processing allows us to generate strong cash flow from operations. Our cash flow from operations of $6.65 billion underscored the strength of our business model. Free cash flow was $5.80 billion and represented 40.3% of revenue, up from 38.4% a year ago. During 2019, we returned $5.97 billion to shareholders through a combination of stock repurchases and dividends. Our strategy is to return all free cash flow to shareholders. Our dividends represented 52% of free cash flow, underscoring their sustainability. For an explanation of free cash flow, see the Non-GAAP financial information section.Details of financial results – 2019 compared with 2018Revenue of $14.38 billion decreased $1.40 billion, or 9%, primarily due to lower revenue from Embedded Processing and Analog.Gross profit of $9.16 billion was down $1.11 billion, or 11%, primarily due to lower revenue. As a percentage of revenue, gross profit decreased to 63.7% from 65.1%.Operating expenses (R&D and SG&A) were $3.19 billion compared with $3.24 billion.Acquisition charges of $288 million were non-cash. See Note 7 to the financial statements.Restructuring charges/other was a credit of $36 million due to the sale of our manufacturing facility in Greenock, Scotland.Operating profit was $5.72 billion, or 39.8% of revenue, compared with $6.71 billion, or 42.5% of revenue.Other income and expense (OI&E) was $175 million of income compared with $98 million of income. See Note 12 to the financial statements.Interest and debt expense of $170 million increased $45 million due to the issuance of additional long-term debt.17Our provision for income taxes was $711 million compared with $1.11 billion. The decrease was due to lower income before income taxes and a lower annual operating tax rate. Our annual operating tax rate, which does not include discrete tax items, was 16% compared with 20% in 2018. We use “annual operating tax rate” to describe the estimated annual effective tax rate, as explained further in the Non-GAAP financial information section.Our effective tax rate, which includes discrete tax items, was 12% in 2019 compared with 17% in 2018. See Note 4 to the financial statements for a reconciliation of the U.S. statutory income tax rate to our effective tax rate.Net income was $5.02 billion compared with $5.58 billion. EPS was $5.24 compared with $5.59.Segment results – 2019 compared with 2018Analog (includes Power, Signal Chain and High Volume product lines)20192018ChangeRevenue$10,223 $10,801 (5)%Operating profit4,477 5,109 (12)%Operating profit % of revenue43.8 %47.3 %Analog revenue decreased due to Power, High Volume and, to a lesser extent, Signal Chain.

Days sales outstanding were 29 at the end of both 2019 and 2018.Inventory was $2.00 billion, a decrease of $216 million from the end of 2018. Days of inventory at the end of 2019 were 144 compared with 152 at the end of 2018.Liquidity and capital resourcesOur primary source of liquidity is cash flow from operations. Additional sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and a variable rate, revolving credit facility. Cash flows from operating activities for 2019 were $6.65 billion, a decrease of $540 million primarily due to lower net income.18Our revolving credit facility is with a consortium of investment-grade banks and allows us to borrow up to $2 billion until March 2024. This credit facility also serves as support for the issuance of commercial paper. As of December 31, 2019, our credit facility was undrawn, and we had no commercial paper outstanding.Investing activities for 2019 used $1.92 billion compared with $78 million in 2018. Capital expenditures were $847 million compared with $1.13 billion in 2018 and were primarily for semiconductor manufacturing equipment in both periods. Short-term investments used cash of $1.14 billion in 2019 and provided cash proceeds of $1.07 billion in 2018.Financing activities for 2019 used $4.73 billion compared with $6.33 billion in 2018. In 2019, we received net proceeds of $1.49 billion from the issuance of fixed-rate, long-term debt and retired maturing debt of $750 million. In 2018, we received net proceeds of $1.50 billion from the issuance of fixed-rate, long-term debt and retired maturing debt of $500 million. Dividends paid in 2019 were $3.01 billion compared with $2.56 billion in 2018, reflecting an increase in the dividend rate, partially offset by fewer shares outstanding. We used $2.96 billion to repurchase 27.4 million shares of our common stock compared with $5.10 billion used in 2018 to repurchase 49.5 million shares. Employee exercises of stock options provided cash proceeds of $539 million compared with $373 million in 2018.We had $2.44 billion of cash and cash equivalents and $2.95 billion of short-term investments as of December 31, 2019. We believe we have the necessary financial resources and operating plans to fund our working capital needs, capital expenditures, dividend and debt-related payments, and other business requirements for at least the next 12 months.Non-GAAP financial informationThis MD&A includes references to free cash flow and ratios based on that measure. These are financial measures that were not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP). Free cash flow was calculated by subtracting capital expenditures from the most directly comparable GAAP measure, cash flows from operating activities (also referred to as cash flow from operations).We believe that free cash flow and the associated ratios provide insight into our liquidity, our cash-generating capability and the amount of cash potentially available to return to shareholders, as well as insight into our financial performance. These non-GAAP measures are supplemental to the comparable GAAP measures.Reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is provided in the table below.For Years Ended December 31,20192018Cash flow from operations (GAAP)$6,649 $7,189 Capital expenditures(847) (1,131) Free cash flow (non-GAAP)$5,802 $6,058 Revenue$14,383 $15,784 Cash flow from operations as a percentage of revenue (GAAP)46.2 %45.5 %Free cash flow as a percentage of revenue (non-GAAP)40.3 %38.4 %This MD&A also includes references to an annual operating tax rate, a non-GAAP term we use to describe the estimated annual effective tax rate, a GAAP measure that by definition does not include discrete tax items. We believe the term annual operating tax rate helps differentiate from the effective tax rate, which includes discrete tax items.19Long-term contractual obligationsPayments Due by PeriodContractual Obligations20202021/20222023/2024ThereafterTotalLong-term debt (a)$669 $1,349 $1,060 $5,488 $8,566 Purchase commitments (b)452 407 97 109 1,065 Transition tax on indefinitely reinvested earnings (c)— 100 237 169 506 Operating leases (d)75 114 66 131 386 Deferred compensation plans (e)23 63 54 135 275 Total (f)$1,219 $2,033 $1,514 $6,032 $10,798 (a)Principal and related interest payments for our long-term debt obligations, including amounts classified as the current portion of long-term debt.(b)Includes payments for software licenses and contractual arrangements with suppliers when there is a fixed, non-cancellable payment schedule or when minimum payments are due with a reduced delivery schedule.

See Note 10 to the financial statements.(e)Estimated payments for certain liabilities that existed as of December 31, 2019.(f)Excludes $303 million of uncertain tax liabilities under ASC 740, as well as any planned future funding contributions to retirement benefit plans. Amounts associated with uncertain tax liabilities have been excluded because of the difficulty in making reasonably reliable estimates of the timing of cash settlements with the respective taxing authorities. Regarding future funding of retirement benefit plans, we plan to contribute about $20 million in 2020, but funding projections beyond 2020 are not practical to estimate due to the rules affecting tax-deductible contributions and the impact from the plans’ asset performance, interest rates and potential U.S. and non-U.S. legislation.Critical accounting policiesOur accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements. As disclosed in Note 2, the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. However, based on facts and circumstances inherent in developing estimates and assumptions, management believes it is unlikely that applying other estimates and assumptions would have a material impact on the financial statements. We consider the following accounting policies to be those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and that require a higher degree of judgment.Revenue recognitionBased on management’s assessment of the revenue recognition criteria, we generally recognize revenue from sales of our products to distributors upon shipment or delivery to the distributors. For our consignment arrangements with distributors, delivery occurs and revenue is recognized when the distributor pulls product from consignment inventory that we store at designated locations. Recognition is not contingent upon resale of the products to the distributors’ customers in either scenario.Revenue is recognized net of allowances, which are management’s estimates of future credits to be granted to distributors under programs common in the semiconductor industry. These allowances are not material and generally include special pricing arrangements, product returns due to quality issues, and incentives designed to maximize growth opportunities.Allowances are based on analysis of historical data and contractual terms and are recorded when revenue is recognized. We believe we can reasonably and reliably estimate allowances for credits to distributors in a timely manner.20Income taxesIn determining net income for financial statement purposes, we must make certain estimates and judgments in the calculation of tax provisions and the resultant tax liabilities and in the recoverability of deferred tax assets that arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense. In the ordinary course of global business, there may be many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. The calculation of tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the interpretation and application of complex tax laws, and significant judgment is necessary to (i) determine whether, based on the technical merits, a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained and (ii) measure the amount of tax benefit that qualifies for recognition. We recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the United States and other tax jurisdictions based on an estimate of the ultimate resolution of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. Although we believe the estimates are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these matters will not be different from what is reflected in the historical income tax provisions and accruals.As part of our financial process, we must assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets can be recovered. If recovery is not likely, the provision for taxes must be increased by recording a reserve in the form of a valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets that are estimated not to be ultimately recoverable. Our judgment regarding future recoverability of our deferred tax assets may change due to various factors, including changes in U.S. or international tax laws and changes in market conditions and their impact on our assessment of taxable income in future periods. These changes, if any, may require adjustments to the deferred tax assets and an accompanying reduction or increase in net income in the period when such determinations are made.Inventory valuation allowancesInventory is valued net of allowances for unsalable or obsolete raw materials, work-in-process and finished goods. Statistical allowances are determined quarterly for raw materials and work-in-process based on historical disposals of inventory for salability and obsolescence reasons. For finished goods, quarterly statistical allowances are determined by comparing inventory levels of individual parts to historical shipments, current backlog and estimated future sales in order to identify inventory considered unlikely to be sold. A specific allowance for each material type will be carried if there is a significant event not captured by the statistical allowance, such as an end-of-life part or demand with imminent risk of cancellation. Allowances are also calculated quarterly for instances where inventoried costs for individual products are in excess of the net realizable value for those products. Actual future write-offs of inventory for salability and obsolescence reasons may differ from estimates and calculations used to determine valuation allowances due to changes in customer demand, customer negotiations, technology shifts and other factors.Changes in accounting standardsSee Note 2 to the financial statements for information regarding the status of new accounting and reporting standards.Off-balance sheet arrangementsAs of December 31, 2019, we had no significant off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K.Commitments and contingenciesSee Note 11 to the financial statements for a discussion of our commitments and contingencies.21ITEM 7A. Quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market riskForeign exchange riskThe U.S. dollar is our functional currency for financial reporting. Our non-U.S. entities own assets or liabilities denominated in U.S. dollars or other currencies. Exchange rate fluctuations impact taxable income in those jurisdictions and consequently impact our effective tax rate.Our balance sheet also reflects amounts remeasured from non-U.S. dollar currencies. Because most of the aggregate non-U.S. dollar balance sheet exposure is hedged by forward currency exchange contracts, based on year-end 2019 balances and currency exchange rates, a hypothetical 10% plus or minus fluctuation in non-U.S. currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar would result in a pretax currency exchange gain or loss of less than $1 million.We use these forward currency exchange contracts to reduce the earnings impact that exchange rate fluctuations may have on our non-U.S. dollar net balance sheet exposures. As of December 31, 2019, we had forward currency exchange contracts outstanding with a notional value of $458 million to hedge net balance sheet exposures (including $136 million to sell Japanese yen, $106 million to sell Indian rupees and $74 million to sell British pounds). Similar hedging activities existed at year-end 2018.Interest rate riskWe have the following potential exposure to changes in interest rates: (i) the effect of changes in interest rates on the fair value of our investments in cash equivalents and short-term investments, which could produce a gain or a loss; and (ii) the effect of changes in interest rates on the fair value of our debt.As of December 31, 2019, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would decrease the fair value of our investments in cash equivalents and short-term investments by about $8 million and decrease the fair value of our long-term debt by $532 million. Because interest rates on our long-term debt are fixed, changes in interest rates would not affect the cash flows associated with long-term debt.Equity riskLong-term investments at year-end 2019 include the following:•Investments in mutual funds – includes mutual funds that were selected to generate returns that offset changes in certain liabilities related to deferred compensation arrangements. The mutual funds hold a variety of debt and equity investments. •Investments in venture capital funds – includes investments in limited partnerships (accounted for under either the equity method or at cost as non-marketable equity securities).•Equity investments – includes non-marketable (non-publicly traded) equity securities.Investments in mutual funds are stated at fair value. Changes in prices of the mutual fund investments are expected to offset related changes in deferred compensation liabilities such that a 10% increase or decrease in the investments’ fair values would not materially affect operating results. Non-marketable equity securities and certain venture capital funds are stated at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from qualifying observable price changes. Investments in the remaining venture capital funds are stated using the equity method. See Note 6 to the financial statements for details of equity and other long-term investments.22",2023-12-30 17:49:06.957884
97476,TXN,TEXAS INSTRUMENTS INC,2021,"ITEM 7. Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsOverviewWe design, make and sell semiconductors to electronics designers and manufacturers all over the world. Technology is the foundation of our company, but ultimately, our objective and the best metric to measure progress and generate long-term value for owners is the growth of free cash flow per share.Our strategy to maximize free cash flow per share growth has three elements:1.A great business model that is focused on analog and embedded processing products and built around four sustainable competitive advantages. The four sustainable competitive advantages are powerful in combination and provide tangible benefits:i.A strong foundation of manufacturing and technology that provides lower costs and greater control of our supply chain.ii.A broad portfolio of analog and embedded processing products that offers more opportunity per customer and more value for our investments.iii.The reach of our market channels that gives access to more customers and more of their design projects, leading to the opportunity to sell more of our products into each design and gives us better insight and knowledge of customer needs.iv.Diversity and longevity of our products, markets and customer positions that provide less single point dependency and longer returns on our investments. Together, these competitive advantages help position TI in a unique class of companies capable of generating and returning significant amounts of cash for our owners. We make our investments with an eye towards long-term strengthening and leveraging of these advantages.2.Discipline in allocating capital to the best opportunities. This spans how we select R&D projects, develop new capabilities like TI.com, invest in new manufacturing capacity or how we think about acquisitions and returning cash to our owners.3.Efficiency, which means constantly striving for more output for every dollar spent.We believe that our business model with the combined effect of our four competitive advantages sets TI apart from our peers and will for a long time to come. We will invest to strengthen our competitive advantages, be disciplined in capital allocation and stay diligent in our pursuit of efficiencies. Finally, we will remain focused on the belief that long-term growth of free cash flow per share is the ultimate measure to generate value. Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (MD&A) should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this document. In the following discussion of our results of operations:•Our segments represent groups of similar products that are combined on the basis of similar design and development requirements, product characteristics, manufacturing processes and distribution channels, and how management allocates resources and measures results. During 2020, we reorganized the product lines within our Analog segment to simplify our business structure into our Power and Signal Chain product lines. These changes had no impact on our previously reported consolidated financial statements or on our reportable segment results. See Note 1 to the financial statements for more information regarding our segments.•When we discuss our results:◦Unless otherwise noted, changes in our revenue are attributable to changes in customer demand, which are evidenced by fluctuations in shipment volumes.◦New products do not tend to have a significant impact on our revenue in any given period because we sell such a large number of products.◦From time to time, our revenue and gross profit are affected by changes in demand for higher-priced or lower-priced products, which we refer to as changes in the “mix” of products shipped.16◦Because we own much of our manufacturing capacity, a significant portion of our operating cost is fixed. When factory loadings decrease, our fixed costs are spread over reduced output and, absent other circumstances, our profit margins decrease. Conversely, as factory loadings increase, our fixed costs are spread over increased output and, absent other circumstances, our profit margins increase. Increases and decreases in factory loadings tend to correspond to increases and decreases in demand.•For an explanation of free cash flow and the term “annual operating tax rate,” see the Non-GAAP financial information section.•All dollar amounts in the tables are stated in millions of U.S. dollars.Our results of operations provides details of our financial results for 2020 and 2019 and year-to-year comparisons between 2020 and 2019. Discussion of 2018 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2019 and 2018 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in “Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in Part II, Item 7 of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019. Impact of COVID-19The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and its follow-on effects are impacting and will likely continue to impact business activity across industries worldwide, including TI. Therefore, we remain cautious about how the economy might behave for the next few years.The impact to our lead times and ability to fulfill orders was minimal in 2020. However, depending on pandemic-related factors like the potential of local manufacturing restrictions on our factories, we could experience constraints in fulfilling customer orders in future periods. The coronavirus pandemic remains dynamic with uncertainty around its duration and broader impact. We continue to monitor and assess the situation and address implications to our business, supply chain and customer demand.We have long had a business continuity plan in place for unforeseeable situations, like we have seen with COVID-19. Additionally, over the past several years, we have invested in building inventory and expanding our global internally owned manufacturing footprint. Investing in these capabilities has given us flexibility, such as the ability to build products across multiple manufacturing sites. These investments have helped to minimize disruptions, but may not be sufficient to eliminate them.Results of operationsOur strategic focus is on analog and embedded processing products sold into six end markets: industrial, automotive, personal electronics, communications equipment, enterprise systems and other. While all end markets represent good opportunities, we place additional strategic emphasis on designing and selling those products into the industrial and automotive markets, which we believe represent the best growth opportunities. Gross margin of 64.1% reflected the quality of our product portfolio, as well as the efficiency of our manufacturing strategy, including the benefit of 300-millimeter Analog production.Our focus on analog and embedded processing allows us to generate strong cash flow from operations. Our cash flow from operations of $6.14 billion underscored the strength of our business model. Free cash flow was $5.49 billion and represented 38.0% of revenue. During 2020, consistent with our commitment to return free cash flow to owners, we returned $5.98 billion to shareholders through a combination of dividends and stock repurchases. Our dividend represented 62% of free cash flow, underscoring its sustainability. Details of financial results – 2020 compared with 2019Revenue of $14.46 billion increased $78 million, or 1%, primarily due to higher revenue from Analog, partially offset by lower revenue from Embedded Processing.Gross profit of $9.27 billion was up $105 million, or 1%, due to higher revenue and increased factory loadings. As a percentage of revenue, gross profit increased to 64.1% from 63.7%.Operating expenses (R&D and SG&A) were $3.15 billion compared with $3.19 billion.Acquisition charges were $198 million compared with $288 million and were non-cash. See Note 7 to the financial statements.17Restructuring charges/other was a charge of $24 million due to an Embedded Processing action, compared with a credit of $36 million due to the sale of our manufacturing facility in Greenock, Scotland in 2019.Operating profit was $5.89 billion, or 40.8% of revenue, compared with $5.72 billion, or 39.8% of revenue.Other income and expense (OI&E) was $313 million of income compared with $175 million of income, which increased primarily due to higher royalty income. See Note 12 to the financial statements.Interest and debt expense of $190 million increased $20 million due to the issuance of additional long-term debt.Our provision for income taxes was $422 million compared with $711 million. The decrease was due to higher discrete tax benefits, which included a $249 million benefit from the settlement of a depreciation-related uncertain tax position and, to a lesser extent, higher U.S. tax benefits, partially offset by higher income before income taxes. Our annual operating tax rate, which does not include discrete tax items, was 14% compared with 16% in 2019. We use “annual operating tax rate” to describe the estimated annual effective tax rate. Our effective tax rate, which includes discrete tax items, was 7% in 2020 compared with 12% in 2019. See Note 4 to the financial statements for a reconciliation of the U.S. statutory corporate tax rate to our effective tax rate.Net income was $5.60 billion compared with $5.02 billion. EPS was $5.97 compared with $5.24.Segment results – 2020 compared with 2019Analog (includes Power and Signal Chain product lines)20202019ChangeRevenue$10,886 $10,223 6 %Operating profit4,912 4,477 10 %Operating profit % of revenue45.1 %43.8 %Analog revenue increased in both product lines about evenly.

Days sales outstanding at the end of 2020 were 31 compared with 29 at the end of 2019.Inventory was $1.96 billion, a decrease of $46 million from the end of 2019. Days of inventory at the end of 2020 were 123 compared with 144 at the end of 2019. Liquidity and capital resourcesOur primary source of liquidity is cash flow from operations. Additional sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and a variable rate, revolving credit facility. Cash flows from operating activities for 2020 were $6.14 billion, a decrease of $510 million primarily due to an increase in cash used for working capital, partially offset by higher net income.Our revolving credit facility is with a consortium of investment-grade banks and allows us to borrow up to $2 billion until March 2024. This credit facility also serves as support for the issuance of commercial paper. As of December 31, 2020, our credit facility was undrawn, and we had no commercial paper outstanding.Investing activities for 2020 used $922 million compared with $1.92 billion in 2019. Capital expenditures were $649 million compared with $847 million in 2019 and were primarily for semiconductor manufacturing equipment and facilities in both periods. Short-term investments used cash of $241 million in 2020 compared with $1.14 billion in 2019.Financing activities for 2020 used $4.55 billion compared with $4.73 billion in 2019. In 2020, we received net proceeds of $1.50 billion from the issuance of fixed-rate, long-term debt and retired maturing debt of $500 million. In 2019, we received net proceeds of $1.49 billion from the issuance of fixed-rate, long-term debt and retired maturing debt of $750 million. Dividends paid in 2020 were $3.43 billion compared with $3.01 billion in 2019, reflecting an increase in the dividend rate, partially offset by fewer shares outstanding. We used $2.55 billion to repurchase 23.4 million shares of our common stock compared with $2.96 billion used in 2019 to repurchase 27.4 million shares. Employee exercises of stock options provided cash proceeds of $470 million compared with $539 million in 2019.We had $3.11 billion of cash and cash equivalents and $3.46 billion of short-term investments as of December 31, 2020. We believe we have the necessary financial resources and operating plans to fund our working capital needs, capital expenditures, dividend and debt-related payments and other business requirements for at least the next 12 months.Non-GAAP financial informationThis MD&A includes references to free cash flow and ratios based on that measure. These are financial measures that were not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP). Free cash flow was calculated by subtracting capital expenditures from the most directly comparable GAAP measure, cash flows from operating activities (also referred to as cash flow from operations).We believe that free cash flow and the associated ratios provide insight into our liquidity, our cash-generating capability and the amount of cash potentially available to return to shareholders, as well as insight into our financial performance. These non-GAAP measures are supplemental to the comparable GAAP measures.Reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is provided in the table below.For Years Ended December 31,20202019Cash flow from operations (GAAP)$6,139 $6,649 Capital expenditures(649)(847)Free cash flow (non-GAAP)$5,490 $5,802 Revenue$14,461 $14,383 Cash flow from operations as a percentage of revenue (GAAP)42.5 %46.2 %Free cash flow as a percentage of revenue (non-GAAP)38.0 %40.3 %19This MD&A also includes references to an annual operating tax rate, a non-GAAP term we use to describe the estimated annual effective tax rate, a GAAP measure that by definition does not include discrete tax items. We believe the term annual operating tax rate helps differentiate from the effective tax rate, which includes discrete tax items.Long-term contractual obligationsPayments Due by PeriodContractual Obligations20212022/20232024/2025ThereafterTotalLong-term debt (a)$726 $1,326 $1,337 $6,172 $9,561 Purchase commitments (b)400 196 55 96 747 Transition tax on indefinitely reinvested earnings (c)44 155 302 — 501 Operating leases (d)76 98 59 138 371 Deferred compensation plans (e)25 68 66 154 313 Total (f)$1,271 $1,843 $1,819 $6,560 $11,493 (a)Principal and related interest payments for our long-term debt obligations, including amounts classified as the current portion of long-term debt.(b)Includes payments for software licenses and contractual arrangements with suppliers when there is a fixed, non-cancellable payment schedule or when minimum payments are due with a reduced delivery schedule.

Amounts associated with uncertain tax liabilities have been excluded because of the difficulty in making reasonably reliable estimates of the timing of cash settlements with the respective taxing authorities. Regarding future funding of retirement benefit plans, we plan to contribute about $10 million in 2021, but funding projections beyond 2021 are not practical to estimate due to the rules affecting tax-deductible contributions and the impact from the plans’ asset performance, interest rates and potential U.S. and non-U.S. legislation.Critical accounting policiesOur accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements. As disclosed in Note 2, the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. However, based on facts and circumstances inherent in developing estimates and assumptions, management believes it is unlikely that applying other estimates and assumptions would have a material impact on the financial statements. We consider the following accounting policies to be those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and that require a higher degree of judgment.Income taxesIn determining net income for financial statement purposes, we must make certain estimates and judgments in the calculation of tax provisions and the resultant tax liabilities and in the recoverability of deferred tax assets that arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense. 20In the ordinary course of global business, there may be many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. The calculation of tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the interpretation and application of complex tax laws, and significant judgment is necessary to (i) determine whether, based on the technical merits, a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained and (ii) measure the amount of tax benefit that qualifies for recognition. We recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the United States and other tax jurisdictions based on an estimate of the ultimate resolution of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. Although we believe the estimates are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these matters will not be different from what is reflected in the historical income tax provisions and accruals.As part of our financial process, we must assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets can be recovered. If recovery is not likely, the provision for taxes must be increased by recording a reserve in the form of a valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets that are estimated not to be ultimately recoverable. Our judgment regarding future recoverability of our deferred tax assets may change due to various factors, including changes in U.S. or international tax laws and changes in market conditions and their impact on our assessment of taxable income in future periods. These changes, if any, may require adjustments to the deferred tax assets and an accompanying reduction or increase in net income in the period when such determinations are made.Inventory valuation allowancesInventory is valued net of allowances for unsalable or obsolete raw materials, work in process and finished goods. Statistical allowances are determined quarterly for raw materials and work in process based on historical disposals of inventory for salability and obsolescence reasons. For finished goods, quarterly statistical allowances are determined by comparing inventory levels of individual parts to historical shipments, current backlog and estimated future sales in order to identify inventory considered unlikely to be sold. A specific allowance for each material type will be carried if there is a significant event not captured by the statistical allowance, such as an end-of-life part or demand with imminent risk of cancellation. Allowances are also calculated quarterly for instances where inventoried costs for individual products are in excess of the net realizable value for those products. Actual future write-offs of inventory for salability and obsolescence reasons may differ from estimates and calculations used to determine valuation allowances due to changes in customer demand, customer negotiations, technology shifts and other factors.Changes in accounting standardsSee Note 2 to the financial statements for information regarding the status of new accounting and reporting standards.Off-balance sheet arrangementsAs of December 31, 2020, we had no significant off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K.Commitments and contingenciesSee Note 11 to the financial statements for a discussion of our commitments and contingencies.21ITEM 7A. Quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market riskForeign exchange riskThe U.S. dollar is our functional currency for financial reporting. Our non-U.S. entities own assets or liabilities denominated in U.S. dollars or other currencies. Exchange rate fluctuations impact taxable income in those jurisdictions and consequently impact our effective tax rate.Our balance sheet also reflects amounts remeasured from non-U.S. dollar currencies. Because most of the aggregate non-U.S. dollar balance sheet exposure is hedged by forward currency exchange contracts, which are based on year-end 2020 balances and currency exchange rates, a hypothetical 10% plus or minus fluctuation in non-U.S. currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar would result in a pretax currency exchange gain or loss of approximately $3 million.We use these forward currency exchange contracts to reduce the earnings impact that exchange rate fluctuations may have on our non-U.S. dollar net balance sheet exposures. As of December 31, 2020, we had forward currency exchange contracts outstanding with a notional value of $416 million to hedge net balance sheet exposures (including $147 million to sell Japanese yen, $85 million to sell euros and $82 million to sell British pounds). Similar hedging activities existed at year-end 2019.Interest rate riskWe have the following potential exposure to changes in interest rates: (i) the effect of changes in interest rates on the fair value of our investments in cash equivalents and short-term investments, which could produce a gain or a loss; and (ii) the effect of changes in interest rates on the fair value of our debt.As of December 31, 2020, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would decrease the fair value of our investments in cash equivalents and short-term investments by about $9 million and decrease the fair value of our long-term debt by $650 million. Because interest rates on our long-term debt are fixed, changes in interest rates would not affect the cash flows associated with long-term debt.Equity riskLong-term investments at year-end 2020 include the following:•Investments in mutual funds – includes mutual funds that were selected to generate returns that offset changes in certain liabilities related to deferred compensation arrangements. The mutual funds hold a variety of debt and equity investments.•Investments in venture capital funds – includes investments in limited partnerships (accounted for under either the equity method or at cost as non-marketable equity securities).•Equity investments – includes non-marketable (non-publicly traded) equity securities.Investments in mutual funds are stated at fair value. Changes in prices of the mutual fund investments are expected to offset related changes in certain deferred compensation liabilities. Non-marketable equity securities and certain venture capital funds are stated at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from qualifying observable price changes. Investments in the remaining venture capital funds are stated using the equity method. See Note 6 to the financial statements for details of equity and other long-term investments.We also utilize total return swaps to economically hedge exposure to changes in liabilities related to the equity market risks of certain deferred compensation arrangements with employees. Gains or losses from changes in the fair value of these total return swaps generally offset the related losses or gains on the deferred compensation liabilities.22",2023-12-30 17:49:05.821144
97476,TXN,TEXAS INSTRUMENTS INC,2022,"ITEM 7. Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsOverviewWe design, make and sell semiconductors to electronics designers and manufacturers all over the world. Technology is the foundation of our company, but ultimately, our objective and the best metric to measure progress and generate long-term value for owners is the growth of free cash flow per share.Our strategy to maximize free cash flow per share growth has three elements:1.A great business model that is focused on analog and embedded processing products and built around four sustainable competitive advantages. The four sustainable competitive advantages are powerful in combination and provide tangible benefits:i.A strong foundation of manufacturing and technology that provides lower costs and greater control of our supply chain.ii.A broad portfolio of analog and embedded processing products that offers more opportunity per customer and more value for our investments.iii.The reach of our market channels that gives access to more customers and more of their design projects, leading to the opportunity to sell more of our products into each design and gives us better insight and knowledge of customer needs.iv.Diversity and longevity of our products, markets and customer positions that provide less single point dependency and longer returns on our investments. Together, these competitive advantages help position TI in a unique class of companies capable of generating and returning significant amounts of cash for our owners. We make our investments with an eye towards long-term strengthening and leveraging of these advantages.2.Discipline in allocating capital to the best opportunities. This spans how we select R&D projects, develop new capabilities like TI.com, invest in new manufacturing capacity or how we think about acquisitions and returning cash to our owners.3.Efficiency, which means constantly striving for more output for every dollar spent.We believe that our business model with the combined effect of our four competitive advantages sets TI apart from our peers and will for a long time to come. We will invest to strengthen our competitive advantages, be disciplined in capital allocation and stay diligent in our pursuit of efficiencies. Finally, we will remain focused on the belief that long-term growth of free cash flow per share is the ultimate measure to generate value. Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (MD&A) should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this document. In the following discussion of our results of operations:•Our segments represent groups of similar products that are combined on the basis of similar design and development requirements, product characteristics, manufacturing processes and distribution channels, and how management allocates resources and measures results. See Note 1 to the financial statements for more information regarding our segments.•When we discuss our results:◦Unless otherwise noted, changes in our revenue are attributable to changes in customer demand, which are evidenced by fluctuations in shipment volumes.◦New products do not tend to have a significant impact on our revenue in any given period because we sell such a large number of products.◦From time to time, our revenue and gross profit are affected by changes in demand for higher-priced or lower-priced products, which we refer to as changes in the “mix” of products shipped.17◦Because we own much of our manufacturing capacity, a significant portion of our operating cost is fixed. When factory loadings decrease, our fixed costs are spread over reduced output and, absent other circumstances, our profit margins decrease. Conversely, as factory loadings increase, our fixed costs are spread over increased output and, absent other circumstances, our profit margins increase.•For an explanation of free cash flow and the term “annual operating tax rate,” see the Non-GAAP financial information section.•All dollar amounts in the tables are stated in millions of U.S. dollars.Our results of operations provides details of our financial results for 2021 and 2020 and year-to-year comparisons between 2021 and 2020. Discussion of 2019 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2020 and 2019 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in “Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in Part II, Item 7 of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020.The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and its effects are impacting and will likely continue to impact market conditions and business operations across industries worldwide, including at TI. Therefore, we remain cautious about how the economy might behave for the next few years and continue to monitor potential impact on our operations.Results of operationsOur strategic focus is on analog and embedded processing products sold into six end markets: industrial, automotive, personal electronics, communications equipment, enterprise systems and other. While all end markets represent good opportunities, we place additional strategic emphasis on designing and selling those products into the industrial and automotive markets, which we believe represent the best growth opportunities. Gross margin of 67.5% reflected the quality of our product portfolio, as well as the efficiency of our manufacturing strategy, including the benefit of 300-millimeter production.Our focus on analog and embedded processing allows us to generate strong cash flow from operations. Our cash flow from operations of $8.76 billion underscored the strength of our business model. Free cash flow was $6.29 billion and represented 34.3% of revenue. During 2021, we returned $4.41 billion to shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases. Over the same period, our dividend represented 62% of free cash flow, underscoring its sustainability. Details of financial results – 2021 compared with 2020Revenue of $18.34 billion increased $3.88 billion, or 27%, due to higher revenue from Analog and, to a lesser extent, Embedded Processing.Gross profit of $12.38 billion was up $3.11 billion, or 34%, primarily due to higher revenue. As a percentage of revenue, gross profit increased to 67.5% from 64.1%.Operating expenses (R&D and SG&A) were $3.22 billion compared with $3.15 billion.Acquisition charges were $142 million compared with $198 million and were non-cash.Restructuring charges/other was $54 million due to integration charges at our Lehi, Utah, manufacturing facility partially offset by gains on sales of assets, compared with $24 million due to an Embedded Processing action in 2020.Operating profit was $8.96 billion, or 48.8% of revenue, compared with $5.89 billion, or 40.8% of revenue.Other income and expense (OI&E) was $143 million of income compared with $313 million of income, which decreased primarily due to lower royalty income. See Note 11 to the financial statements.Our provision for income taxes was $1.15 billion compared with $422 million. This increase was due to higher income before income taxes and lower discrete tax benefits compared to 2020, which included a $249 million benefit from the settlement of a depreciation-related uncertain tax position.18Our annual operating tax rate, which does not include discrete tax items, was 14% in both periods. We use “annual operating tax rate” to describe the estimated annual effective tax rate. Our effective tax rate, which includes discrete tax items, was 13% in 2021 compared with 7% in 2020. See Note 4 to the financial statements for a reconciliation of the U.S. statutory corporate tax rate to our effective tax rate.Net income was $7.77 billion compared with $5.60 billion.

Days sales outstanding at the end of 2021 were 32 compared with 31 at the end of 2020.Inventory was $1.91 billion, a decrease of $45 million from the end of 2020. Days of inventory at the end of 2021 were 116 compared with 123 at the end of 2020.Liquidity and capital resourcesOur primary source of liquidity is cash flow from operations. Additional sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and access to debt markets. We also have a variable rate, revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2021, our credit facility was undrawn, and we had no commercial paper outstanding. Cash flows from operating activities for 2021 were $8.76 billion, an increase of $2.62 billion due to higher net income and lower cash used for working capital.19Investing activities for 2021 used $4.10 billion compared with $922 million in 2020. Capital expenditures were $2.46 billion compared with $649 million in 2020 and were primarily for semiconductor manufacturing equipment and facilities in both periods, including the purchase of our 300-millimeter semiconductor factory in Lehi, Utah, during 2021. As we continue to invest to strengthen our competitive advantage in manufacturing and technology as part of our long-term capacity planning, we expect our capital expenditures to be higher than historical levels. Short-term investments used cash of $1.65 billion in 2021 compared with $241 million in 2020.Financing activities for 2021 used $3.14 billion compared with $4.55 billion in 2020. In 2021, we received net proceeds of $1.50 billion from the issuance of fixed-rate, long-term debt and retired maturing debt of $550 million. In 2020, we received net proceeds of $1.50 billion from the issuance of fixed-rate, long-term debt and retired maturing debt of $500 million. Dividends paid in 2021 were $3.89 billion compared with $3.43 billion in 2020, reflecting an increased dividend rate. We used $527 million to repurchase 2.9 million shares of our common stock compared with $2.55 billion used in 2020 to repurchase 23.4 million shares. Employee exercises of stock options provided cash proceeds of $377 million compared with $470 million in 2020.We had $4.63 billion of cash and cash equivalents and $5.11 billion of short-term investments as of December 31, 2021. We believe we have the necessary financial resources and operating plans to fund our working capital needs, capital expenditures, dividend and debt-related payments and other business requirements for at least the next 12 months.Non-GAAP financial informationThis MD&A includes references to free cash flow and ratios based on that measure. These are financial measures that were not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP). Free cash flow was calculated by subtracting capital expenditures from the most directly comparable GAAP measure, cash flows from operating activities (also referred to as cash flow from operations).We believe that free cash flow and the associated ratios provide insight into our liquidity, our cash-generating capability and the amount of cash potentially available to return to shareholders, as well as insight into our financial performance.

We believe the term annual operating tax rate helps differentiate from the effective tax rate, which includes discrete tax items.Critical accounting estimatesOur accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements. As disclosed in Note 2, the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. However, based on facts and circumstances inherent in developing estimates and assumptions, management believes it is unlikely that applying other estimates and assumptions would have a material impact on the financial statements. We consider the following accounting policies to be those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and that require a higher degree of judgment.20Income taxesIn determining net income for financial statement purposes, we must make certain estimates and judgments in the calculation of tax provisions and the resultant tax liabilities and in the recoverability of deferred tax assets that arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense. In the ordinary course of global business, there may be many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. The calculation of tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the interpretation and application of complex tax laws, and significant judgment is necessary to (i) determine whether, based on the technical merits, a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained and (ii) measure the amount of tax benefit that qualifies for recognition. We recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the United States and other tax jurisdictions based on an estimate of the ultimate resolution of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. Although we believe the estimates are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these matters will not be different from what is reflected in the historical income tax provisions and accruals.As part of our financial process, we must assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets can be recovered. If recovery is not likely, the provision for taxes must be increased by recording a reserve in the form of a valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets that are estimated not to be ultimately recoverable. Our judgment regarding future recoverability of our deferred tax assets may change due to various factors, including changes in U.S. or international tax laws and changes in market conditions and their impact on our assessment of taxable income in future periods. These changes, if any, may require adjustments to the valuation allowances and an accompanying reduction or increase in net income in the period when such determinations are made.Inventory valuation allowancesInventory is valued net of allowances for unsalable or obsolete raw materials, work in process and finished goods. Statistical allowances are determined quarterly for raw materials and work in process based on historical disposals of inventory for salability and obsolescence reasons. For finished goods, quarterly statistical allowances are determined by comparing inventory levels of individual parts to historical shipments, current backlog and estimated future sales in order to identify inventory considered unlikely to be sold. A specific allowance for each material type will be carried if there is a significant event not captured by the statistical allowance, such as an end-of-life part or demand with imminent risk of cancellation. Allowances are also calculated quarterly for instances where inventoried costs for individual products are in excess of the net realizable value for those products. Actual future write-offs of inventory for salability and obsolescence reasons may differ from estimates and calculations used to determine valuation allowances due to changes in customer demand, customer negotiations, technology shifts and other factors.Commitments and contingenciesSee Note 10 to the financial statements for a discussion of our commitments and contingencies.21ITEM 7A. Quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market riskForeign exchange riskThe U.S. dollar is our functional currency for financial reporting. Our non-U.S. entities own assets or liabilities denominated in U.S. dollars or other currencies, and exchange rate fluctuations in those jurisdictions may impact our effective tax rate.Our balance sheet also reflects amounts remeasured from non-U.S. dollar currencies. Because most of the aggregate non-U.S. dollar balance sheet exposure is hedged by forward currency exchange contracts, which are based on year-end 2021 balances and currency exchange rates, a hypothetical 10% plus or minus fluctuation in non-U.S. currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar would result in a pretax currency exchange gain or loss of approximately $1 million.We use these forward currency exchange contracts to reduce the earnings impact that exchange rate fluctuations may have on our non-U.S. dollar net balance sheet exposures. As of December 31, 2021, we had forward currency exchange contracts outstanding with a notional value of $313 million to hedge net balance sheet exposures (including $127 million to sell Japanese yen, $82 million to sell British pounds and $42 million to sell euros). Similar hedging activities existed at year-end 2020.Interest rate riskWe have the following potential exposure to changes in interest rates: (i) the effect of changes in interest rates on the fair value of our investments in cash equivalents and short-term investments, which could produce a gain or a loss; and (ii) the effect of changes in interest rates on the fair value of our debt.As of December 31, 2021, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would decrease the fair value of our investments in cash equivalents and short-term investments by about $15 million and decrease the fair value of our long-term debt by $715 million. Because interest rates on our long-term debt are fixed, changes in interest rates would not affect the cash flows associated with long-term debt.Equity riskLong-term investments at year-end 2021 include the following:•Investments in mutual funds – includes mutual funds that were selected to generate returns that offset changes in certain liabilities related to deferred compensation arrangements. The mutual funds hold a variety of debt and equity investments.•Investments in venture capital funds – includes investments in limited partnerships (accounted for under either the equity method or at cost with adjustments to observable market changes or impairments).•Equity investments – includes non-marketable (non-publicly traded) equity securities.Investments in mutual funds are stated at fair value. Changes in prices of the mutual fund investments are expected to offset related changes in certain deferred compensation liabilities. Non-marketable equity securities and certain venture capital funds are stated at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from qualifying observable price changes. Investments in the remaining venture capital funds are stated using the equity method. See Note 6 to the financial statements for details of equity and other long-term investments.We also utilize total return swaps to economically hedge exposure to changes in liabilities related to the equity market risks of certain deferred compensation arrangements with employees. Gains or losses from changes in the fair value of these total return swaps generally offset the related losses or gains on the deferred compensation liabilities.22",2023-12-30 17:49:04.039108
97476,TXN,TEXAS INSTRUMENTS INC,2023,"ITEM 7. Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsOverviewWe design and manufacture semiconductors that we sell to electronics designers and manufacturers all over the world. Technology is the foundation of our company, but ultimately, our objective and the best metric for owners to measure our progress is through the growth of free cash flow per share over the long term.Our strategy to maximize long-term free cash flow per share growth has three elements:1.A great business model that is focused on analog and embedded processing products and built around four sustainable competitive advantages. The four sustainable competitive advantages are powerful in combination and provide tangible benefits:(a) A strong foundation of manufacturing and technology that provides lower costs and greater control of our supply chain.(b) A broad portfolio of analog and embedded processing products that offers more opportunity per customer and more value for our investments.(c) The reach of our market channels that gives access to more customers and more of their design projects, leading to the opportunity to sell more of our products into each design and gives us better insight and knowledge of customer needs.(d) Diversity and longevity of our products, markets and customer positions that provide less single point dependency and longer returns on our investments. Together, these competitive advantages help position TI in a unique class of companies capable of generating and returning significant amounts of cash for our owners. We make our investments with an eye towards long-term strengthening and leveraging of these advantages.2.Discipline in allocating capital to the best opportunities. This spans how we select R&D projects, develop new capabilities like TI.com, invest in new manufacturing capacity or how we think about acquisitions and returning cash to our owners.3.Efficiency, which means constantly striving for more output for every dollar spent.We believe that our business model with the combined effect of our four competitive advantages sets TI apart from our peers and will for a long time to come. We will invest to strengthen our competitive advantages, be disciplined in capital allocation and stay diligent in our pursuit of efficiencies. Finally, we will remain focused on the belief that long-term growth of free cash flow per share is the ultimate measure to generate value. Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (MD&A) should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this document. In the following discussion of our results of operations:•Our segments represent groups of similar products that are combined on the basis of similar design and development requirements, product characteristics, manufacturing processes and distribution channels, and how management allocates resources and measures results. See Note 1 to the financial statements for more information regarding our segments.•When we discuss our results:◦Unless otherwise noted, changes in our revenue are attributable to changes in customer demand, which are evidenced by fluctuations in shipment volumes.◦New products do not tend to have a significant impact on our revenue in any given period because we sell such a large number of products.◦From time to time, our revenue and gross profit are affected by changes in demand for higher-priced or lower-priced products, which we refer to as changes in the “mix” of products shipped.17◦Because we own much of our manufacturing capacity, a significant portion of our operating cost is fixed. When factory loadings decrease, our fixed costs are spread over reduced output and, absent other circumstances, our profit margins decrease. Conversely, as factory loadings increase, our fixed costs are spread over increased output and, absent other circumstances, our profit margins increase.•For an explanation of free cash flow, see the Non-GAAP financial information section.•All dollar amounts in the tables are stated in millions of U.S. dollars.Our results of operations provides details of our financial results for 2022 and 2021 and year-to-year comparisons between 2022 and 2021. Discussion of 2020 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2021 and 2020 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in “Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in Part II, Item 7 of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021.The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and its effects are impacting and will likely continue to impact market conditions and business operations across industries worldwide, including at TI. Therefore, we remain cautious about how the economy might behave for the next few years and continue to monitor potential impact on our operations.After a sustained period of growth, a market correction began in 2022. As a result, demand for our products weakened, and we expect this to continue into 2023. During this time, we will continue to manage our operating plan and expenses with a steady hand as we focus on long-term investments to strengthen our competitive advantages.Results of operationsOur strategic focus is on analog and embedded processing products. We sell our products into six end markets: industrial, automotive, personal electronics, communications equipment, enterprise systems and other. While all of these end markets represent good opportunities, we place additional strategic emphasis on designing and selling our products into the industrial and automotive markets, which we believe represent the best long-term growth opportunities. Gross margin of 68.8% reflected the quality of our product portfolio, as well as the efficiency of our manufacturing strategy, including the benefit of 300-mm production.Our focus on analog and embedded processing allows us to generate strong cash flow from operations. Our cash flow from operations of $8.72 billion underscored the strength of our business model. Free cash flow was $5.92 billion and represented 29.6% of revenue. During 2022, we invested $3.37 billion in R&D and SG&A, invested $2.80 billion in capital expenditures and returned $7.91 billion to shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases.Details of financial results – 2022 compared with 2021Revenue of $20.03 billion increased $1.68 billion, or 9.2%, due to higher revenue from Analog and, to a lesser extent, Embedded Processing. This increase benefited from higher prices and the mix of products shipped.Gross profit of $13.77 billion was up $1.40 billion, or 11.3%, primarily due to higher revenue. As a percentage of revenue, gross profit increased to 68.8% from 67.5%.Operating expenses (R&D and SG&A) were $3.37 billion compared with $3.22 billion, as a result of increased investments in R&D and inflation.Restructuring charges/other was $257 million compared with $54 million due to integration charges at our Lehi, Utah, manufacturing facility in both periods, which were partially offset by gains on sales of assets in 2021. The charges associated with our Lehi facility transitioned to cost of revenue once production began in December 2022. See Note 11 to the financial statements.Operating profit was $10.14 billion, or 50.6% of revenue, compared with $8.96 billion, or 48.8% of revenue.Other income and expense (OI&E) was $106 million of income compared with $143 million of income. See Note 11 to the financial statements.18Interest and debt expense of $214 million increased $30 million due to the issuance of additional long-term debt. See Note 8 to the financial statements.Our provision for income taxes was $1.28 billion compared with $1.15 billion. This increase was primarily due to higher income before income taxes and lower discrete tax benefits compared to 2021. Our effective tax rate, which includes discrete tax items, was 12.8% in 2022 compared with 12.9% in 2021. See Note 4 to the financial statements for a reconciliation of the U.S. statutory corporate tax rate to our effective tax rate.Net income was $8.75 billion compared with $7.77 billion. EPS was $9.41 compared with $8.26.Segment results – 2022 compared with 2021Analog (includes Power and Signal Chain product lines)20222021ChangeRevenue$15,359 $14,050 9 %Operating profit8,359 7,393 13 %Operating profit % of revenue54.4 %52.6 %Analog revenue increased in both product lines, led by Signal Chain.

Days sales outstanding at the end of 2022 were 37 compared with 32 at the end of 2021.Inventory was $2.76 billion, an increase of $847 million from the end of 2021. Days of inventory at the end of 2022 were 157 compared with 116 at the end of 2021.19Liquidity and capital resourcesOur primary source of liquidity is cash flow from operations. Additional sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and access to debt markets. We also have a variable-rate, revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2022, our credit facility was undrawn, and we had no commercial paper outstanding. Cash flows from operating activities for 2022 were $8.72 billion, a decrease of $36 million due to higher cash used for working capital as we continued to strategically build our inventory, offset by higher net income.Investing activities for 2022 used $3.58 billion compared with $4.10 billion in 2021. Capital expenditures were $2.80 billion compared with $2.46 billion in 2021 and were primarily for semiconductor manufacturing equipment and facilities in both periods, including the purchase of our 300-mm semiconductor factory in Lehi, Utah, during 2021. Short-term investments used cash of $826 million in 2022 compared with $1.65 billion in 2021.As we continue to invest to strengthen our competitive advantage in manufacturing and technology as part of our long-term capacity planning, our capital expenditures are expected to be higher than historical levels. In August 2022, the U.S. government enacted the U.S. CHIPS and Science Act, which provides funding for manufacturing grants and research investments and establishes a 25% investment tax credit for certain investments in U.S. semiconductor manufacturing. We expect to receive the cash benefit associated with the investment tax credit for qualifying capital expenditures in future periods and to apply for other incentives provided by the legislation.Financing activities for 2022 used $6.72 billion compared with $3.14 billion in 2021. In 2022, we received net proceeds of $1.49 billion from the issuance of fixed-rate, long-term debt and retired maturing debt of $500 million. In 2021, we received net proceeds of $1.50 billion from the issuance of fixed-rate, long-term debt and retired maturing debt of $550 million. Dividends paid in 2022 were $4.30 billion compared with $3.89 billion in 2021, reflecting an increased dividend rate, partially offset by fewer shares outstanding. We used $3.62 billion to repurchase 22.2 million shares of our common stock compared with $527 million used in 2021 to repurchase 2.9 million shares. Employee exercises of stock options provided cash proceeds of $241 million compared with $377 million in 2021.We had $3.05 billion of cash and cash equivalents and $6.02 billion of short-term investments as of December 31, 2022. We believe we have the necessary financial resources and operating plans to fund our working capital needs, capital expenditures, dividend and debt-related payments and other business requirements for at least the next 12 months.Non-GAAP financial informationThis MD&A includes references to free cash flow and ratios based on that measure. These are financial measures that were not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP). Free cash flow was calculated by subtracting capital expenditures from the most directly comparable GAAP measure, cash flows from operating activities (also referred to as cash flow from operations).We believe that free cash flow and the associated ratios provide insight into our liquidity, our cash-generating capability and the amount of cash potentially available to return to shareholders, as well as insight into our financial performance. These non-GAAP measures are supplemental to the comparable GAAP measures.Reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is provided in the table below.For Years Ended December 31,20222021Cash flow from operations (GAAP)$8,720 $8,756 Capital expenditures(2,797)(2,462)Free cash flow (non-GAAP)$5,923 $6,294 Revenue$20,028 $18,344 Cash flow from operations as a percentage of revenue (GAAP)43.5 %47.7 %Free cash flow as a percentage of revenue (non-GAAP)29.6 %34.3 %20Critical accounting estimatesOur accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements. As disclosed in Note 2, the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Management believes it is unlikely that applying other estimates and assumptions would have a material impact on the financial statements. We consider the following accounting policies to be those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and that require a higher degree of judgment.Income taxesIn determining net income for financial statement purposes, we must make certain estimates and judgments in the calculation of tax provisions and the resultant tax liabilities and in the recoverability of deferred tax assets that arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense. In the ordinary course of global business, there may be many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. The calculation of tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the interpretation and application of complex tax laws, and significant judgment is necessary to (i) determine whether, based on the technical merits, a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained and (ii) measure the amount of tax benefit that qualifies for recognition. We recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the United States and other tax jurisdictions based on an estimate of the ultimate resolution of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. Although we believe the estimates are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these matters will not be different from what is reflected in the historical income tax provisions and accruals.As part of our financial process, we must assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets can be recovered. If recovery is not likely, the provision for taxes must be increased by recording a reserve in the form of a valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets that are estimated not to be ultimately recoverable. Our judgment regarding future recoverability of our deferred tax assets may change due to various factors, including changes in U.S. or international tax laws and changes in market conditions and their impact on our assessment of taxable income in future periods. These changes, if any, may require adjustments to the valuation allowances and an accompanying reduction or increase in net income in the period when such determinations are made.Inventory valuation allowancesInventory is valued net of allowances for unsalable or obsolete raw materials, work in process and finished goods. Statistical allowances are determined quarterly for raw materials and work in process based on historical disposals of inventory for salability and obsolescence reasons. For finished goods, quarterly statistical allowances are determined by comparing inventory levels of individual parts to historical shipments, current backlog and estimated future sales in order to identify inventory considered unlikely to be sold. A specific allowance for each material type will be carried if there is a significant event not captured by the statistical allowance, such as an end-of-life part or demand with imminent risk of cancellation. Allowances are also calculated quarterly for instances where inventoried costs for individual products are in excess of the net realizable value for those products. Actual future write-offs of inventory for salability and obsolescence reasons may differ from estimates and calculations used to determine valuation allowances due to changes in customer demand, customer negotiations, technology shifts and other factors.Commitments and contingenciesSee Note 10 to the financial statements for a discussion of our commitments and contingencies.21ITEM 7A. Quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market riskForeign exchange riskThe U.S. dollar is our functional currency for financial reporting. Our non-U.S. entities own assets or liabilities denominated in U.S. dollars or other currencies, and exchange rate fluctuations in those jurisdictions may impact our effective tax rate.Our balance sheet also reflects amounts remeasured from non-U.S. dollar currencies. Because most of the aggregate non-U.S. dollar balance sheet exposure is hedged by forward currency exchange contracts, which are based on year-end 2022 balances and currency exchange rates, a hypothetical 10% plus or minus fluctuation in non-U.S. currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar would result in a pretax currency exchange gain or loss of approximately $3 million.We use these forward currency exchange contracts to reduce the earnings impact that exchange rate fluctuations may have on our non-U.S. dollar net balance sheet exposures. As of December 31, 2022, we had forward currency exchange contracts outstanding with a notional value of $387 million to hedge net balance sheet exposures (including $118 million to sell Japanese yen, $78 million to sell British pounds and $49 million to buy Chinese yuan). Similar hedging activities existed at year-end 2021.Interest rate riskWe have the following potential exposure to changes in interest rates: (i) the effect of changes in interest rates on the fair value of our investments in cash equivalents and short-term investments, which could produce a gain or a loss; and (ii) the effect of changes in interest rates on the fair value of our debt.As of December 31, 2022, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would decrease the fair value of our investments in cash equivalents and short-term investments by about $15 million and decrease the fair value of our long-term debt by $566 million. Because interest rates on our long-term debt are fixed, changes in interest rates would not affect the cash flows associated with long-term debt.Equity riskLong-term investments at year-end 2022 include the following:•Investments in mutual funds – includes mutual funds that were selected to generate returns that offset changes in certain liabilities related to deferred compensation arrangements. The mutual funds hold a variety of debt and equity investments.•Investments in venture capital funds – includes investments in limited partnerships (accounted for under either the equity method or at cost with adjustments to observable market changes or impairments).•Equity investments – includes non-marketable (non-publicly traded) equity securities.Investments in mutual funds are stated at fair value. Changes in prices of the mutual fund investments are expected to offset related changes in certain deferred compensation liabilities. Non-marketable equity securities and certain venture capital funds are stated at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from qualifying observable price changes. Investments in the remaining venture capital funds are stated using the equity method. See Note 6 to the financial statements for details of equity and other long-term investments.We also utilize total return swaps to economically hedge exposure to changes in liabilities related to the market risks of certain deferred compensation arrangements with employees. Gains or losses from changes in the fair value of these total return swaps generally offset the related losses or gains on the deferred compensation liabilities.22",2023-12-30 17:49:03.747348

97476,TXN,TEXAS INSTRUMENTS INC,2016,"ITEM 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Overview We design, make and sell semiconductors to electronics designers and manufacturers all over the world. Our business model is carefully constructed around the following attributes: · Industry’s broadest portfolio of differentiated analog and embedded processing semiconductors. Our customers’ design engineers need at least one, and most times multiple, chips for their systems. The breadth of our portfolio means we can solve more of these needs than can our competitors, which gives us access to more customers and the opportunity to generate more revenue per system. We invest more than $1 billion each year to develop new products for our portfolio. · A strong foundation of manufacturing technology and low-cost production. We invest in manufacturing technologies that differentiate the features of our semiconductors, and we do most of our own production in-house, as opposed to outsourcing it. This ability to directly control our manufacturing helps ensure a consistent supply of products for our customers. We produce billions of semiconductors each year on a mixture of 150-, 200- and 300-millimeter wafers, and we are able to keep costs low for manufacturing facilities and equipment because our analog and much of our embedded processing semiconductors can be made using mature assets that we acquire ahead of demand when their prices are most attractive. In 2015, we produced approximately 25 percent of our Analog semiconductors on 300-millimeter wafers, the industry’s largest wafers, which have a 40 percent cost advantage per unpackaged chip over 200-millimeter wafers. The majority of our future Analog growth will be produced on 300-millimeter wafers, which will be meaningful to the growth of our margins and cash flow over the long term. · Industry’s largest market channels. Our global sales force is larger than those of our competitors, and the breadth of our portfolio attracts tens of millions of visits to our web site each year where customers often begin their initial product searches and design-in journey. These capabilities combine to provide us unique access to more than 100,000 customers. · Diversity and longevity in our products and in the markets we serve. The attributes above result in diverse and long-lived positions that deliver high terminal value to our shareholders. Because of the breadth of our portfolio we are not dependent on any single product, and because of the breadth of our markets we are not dependent on any single application or customer. Some of our products generate revenue for decades, which strengthens the return on our investments. The combined effect of these attributes is that we have consistently grown free cash flow and gained market share in Analog and Embedded Processing. These attributes put us in a unique class of companies with the ability to grow, generate cash, and return that cash to shareholders. Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (MD&A) should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this document. In the following discussion of our results of operations: · All dollar amounts in the tables are stated in millions of U.S. dollars. · When we discuss our results: o Unless otherwise noted, changes in our revenue are attributable to changes in customer demand, which are evidenced by fluctuations in shipment volumes. o New products tend not to have a significant impact on our revenue in any given period because we sell such a large number of products. o From time to time, our revenue and gross profit are affected by changes in demand for higher-priced or lower-priced products, which we refer to as changes in the “mix” of products shipped. o Because we own much of our manufacturing capacity, a significant portion of our operating cost is fixed. When factory loadings decrease, our fixed costs are spread over reduced output and, absent other circumstances, our profit margins decrease. Conversely, as factory loadings increase, our fixed costs are spread over increased output and, absent other circumstances, our profit margins increase. Increases and decreases in factory loadings tend to correspond to increases and decreases in demand. o The term “legacy wireless products” refers to our baseband products, OMAPTM applications processors and connectivity products sold into smartphones and consumer tablets. Our exit from legacy wireless products was complete in 2013. 17 · Our segments represent groups of similar products that are combined on the basis of similar design and development requirements, product characteristics, manufacturing processes and distribution channels, and how management allocates resources and measures results. See Note 1 to the financial statements for more information regarding our segments. Results of operations We continued to perform well in 2015, reflecting our focus on Analog and Embedded Processing semiconductors. These products serve highly diverse markets with thousands of applications, and we believe have dependable long-term growth opportunities. In 2015, Analog and Embedded Processing represented 86 percent of revenue, up from 83 percent in 2014. Gross margin of 58.2 percent for the year, a new record, reflects the quality of our product portfolio, as well as the efficiency of our manufacturing strategy. Our focus on Analog and Embedded Processing allows us to generate strong cash flow from operations. In 2015, free cash flow, also a record, was 28.6 percent of revenue, up from 26.9 percent a year ago and consistent with our targeted range of 20-30 percent of revenue. During the year, we returned $4.2 billion of cash to investors through a combination of stock repurchases and dividends. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure. For a reconciliation to GAAP and an explanation of the reason for providing this non-GAAP measure, see the Non-GAAP financial information section after the Liquidity and capital resources section. Details of financial results – 2015 compared with 2014 Revenue of $13.00 billion was about even with 2014, as higher revenue from Analog and Embedded Processing was offset by lower revenue from Other. Our 2015 revenue was negatively affected by about $150 million from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Gross profit was $7.56 billion, an increase of $133 million, or 2 percent, due to lower manufacturing costs. Gross profit margin was 58.2 percent of revenue compared with 56.9 percent. Operating expenses were $1.28 billion for R&D and $1.75 billion for SG&A. R&D expense decreased $78 million, or 6 percent, and SG&A decreased $95 million, or 5 percent. Both comparisons reflect savings from ongoing efforts across the company to align costs with growth opportunities, including the completed restructuring actions in Embedded Processing and Japan. These decreases were partially offset by higher compensation-related costs. Acquisition charges were related to our 2011 acquisition of National Semiconductor and were $329 million, about even with 2014. These non-cash charges were primarily from the amortization of intangible assets. See Note 13 to the financial statements. Restructuring charges/other was a net credit of $71 million, which included gains on sales of assets of $83 million that were partially offset by $12 million related to restructuring charges and other credits. This compared with a net credit of $51 million in 2014, reflecting gains on sales of assets of $75 million that were partially offset by restructuring charges and other expenses of $24 million. These amounts are included in Other for segment reporting purposes. See Note 3 to the financial statements. Operating profit was $4.27 billion, or 32.9 percent of revenue, compared with $3.95 billion, or 30.3 percent of revenue. The income tax provision was $1.23 billion compared with $1.05 billion. The increase in the total tax provision was due to higher income before income taxes and, to a lesser extent, a lower benefit from non-U.S. effective tax rates. Our annual effective tax rate was 29 percent in 2015 and 27 percent in 2014. See Note 6 to the financial statements for a reconciliation of the income tax provision to the statutory federal tax. Net income was $2.99 billion, an increase of $165 million, or 6 percent. EPS was $2.82 compared with $2.57. EPS benefited $0.07 due to a lower number of average shares outstanding as a result of our stock repurchase program. In the near term, for the first quarter of 2016, we expect about a $150 million decline in revenue from the first quarter of 2015 within a sector of the personal electronics market. 18 Segment results – 2015 compared with 2014 Analog (includes High Volume Analog & Logic (HVAL), Power Management (Power), High Performance Analog (HPA) and Silicon Valley Analog (SVA) product lines) 2015 2014 Change Revenue $ 8,339 $ 8,104 3 % Operating profit 3,048 2,786 9 % Operating profit % of revenue 36.6 % 34.4 % Analog revenue increased primarily due to HVAL. Power and SVA also grew, but to a lesser extent. HPA declined due to the mix of products shipped. Operating profit increased due to higher revenue and associated gross profit and, to a lesser extent, lower manufacturing costs. Embedded Processing (includes Microcontrollers, Processors and Connectivity product lines) 2015 2014 Change Revenue $ 2,787 $ 2,740 2 % Operating profit 596 384 55 % Operating profit % of revenue 21.4 % 14.0 % Embedded Processing revenue increased due about equally to Connectivity and Microcontrollers, which together offset a decline in Processors. Operating profit increased primarily due to lower operating expenses.

Revenue from DLP products also declined, but to a lesser extent. Operating profit declined primarily due to lower revenue and associated gross profit. Prior results of operations In 2014, Analog revenue grew 13 percent and Embedded Processing revenue grew 12 percent. Gross margin of 56.9 percent for 2014 reflected the diversity and longevity of our product portfolio, as well as the efficiency of our manufacturing strategy. In 2014, free cash flow was 26.9 percent of revenue, up from 24.4 percent in 2013. During 2014, we returned $4.2 billion of cash to investors through a combination of stock repurchases and dividends. Details of financial results – 2014 compared with 2013 Revenue was $13.05 billion, up $840 million, or 7 percent, from 2013 due to higher revenue from Analog and Embedded Processing. These increases more than offset lower revenue from legacy wireless products. Gross profit was $7.43 billion, an increase of $1.06 billion, or 17 percent, from 2013 primarily due to higher revenue and, to a lesser extent, the mix of products shipped. Gross profit margin was 56.9 percent of revenue compared with 52.1 percent in 2013. Operating expenses were $1.36 billion for R&D and $1.84 billion for SG&A. R&D expense decreased $164 million, or 11 percent, from 2013 primarily due to savings from ongoing efforts across the company to align costs with growth opportunities, including the wind-down of our legacy wireless products and restructuring actions in Embedded Processing and Japan. SG&A expense was about even, as higher variable compensation costs were offset by savings from our cost alignment efforts. Acquisition charges were related to our 2011 acquisition of National Semiconductor and were $330 million compared with $341 million in 2013. The charges were primarily from the amortization of intangible assets. 19 Restructuring charges/other was a net credit of $51 million, which included gains on sales of assets of $75 million that were partially offset by restructuring charges and other expenses of $24 million. This compared with a net credit of $189 million in 2013, reflecting a $315 million gain from our transfer of wireless connectivity technology to a customer that was partially offset by restructuring charges of $126 million. Operating profit was $3.95 billion, or 30.3 percent of revenue, compared with $2.83 billion, or 23.2 percent, in 2013. The income tax provision was $1.05 billion compared with $592 million in 2013. The increase in the total tax provision was due to higher income before income taxes and, to a lesser extent, the effect of the retroactive reinstatement of the federal research tax credit for 2012 in 2013. Our annual effective tax rate was 27 percent in 2014 and 24 percent in 2013. Net income was $2.82 billion, an increase of $659 million, or 30 percent, from 2013. EPS was $2.57 compared with $1.91 in 2013. EPS benefited $0.07 from 2013 due to a lower number of average shares outstanding as a result of our stock repurchase program. Segment results – 2014 compared with 2013 Analog 2014 2013 Change Revenue $ 8,104 $ 7,194 13 % Operating profit 2,786 1,859 50 % Operating profit % of revenue 34.4 % 25.8 % Analog revenue increased in all products lines. Revenue from Power grew the most, followed by revenue from, in decreasing order, HPA, HVAL and SVA. Operating profit increased primarily due to higher revenue and associated gross profit. Embedded Processing 2014 2013 Change Revenue $ 2,740 $ 2,450 12 % Operating profit 384 185 108 % Operating profit % of revenue 14.0 % 7.6 % Embedded Processing revenue increased primarily due to Microcontrollers and Processors, which contributed about equally to the increase. Connectivity increased to a lesser extent. Revenue from Processors increased as a result of the mix of products shipped. Operating profit increased primarily due to higher revenue and associated gross profit. Other 2014 2013 Change Revenue $ 2,201 $ 2,561 (14 )% Operating profit* 777 788 (1 )% Operating profit % of revenue 35.3 % 30.8 % *Includes Acquisition charges and Restructuring charges/other Other revenue decreased due to legacy wireless products. Operating profit was about even as reductions in operating expenses were offset by changes in Restructuring charges/other. Financial condition At the end of 2015, total cash (Cash and cash equivalents plus Short-term investments) was $3.22 billion, a decrease of $323 million from the end of 2014. Accounts receivable were $1.17 billion at the end of 2015. This was a decrease of $81 million compared with the end of 2014. Days sales outstanding were 33 at the end of 2015 compared with 34 at the end of 2014. 20 Inventory was $1.69 billion at the end of 2015. This was a decrease of $93 million from the end of 2014. Days of inventory at the end of 2015 were 115 compared with 117 at the end of 2014. Liquidity and capital resources Our primary source of liquidity is cash flow from operations. Additional sources of liquidity are Cash and cash equivalents, Short-term investments and a variable rate revolving credit facility. Cash flows from operating activities for 2015 was $4.27 billion, an increase of $376 million from 2014 primarily due to an increase in cash provided by working capital. Our revolving credit facility is with a consortium of investment-grade banks and allows us to borrow up to $2 billion until March 2020. This credit facility also serves as support for the issuance of commercial paper. As of December 31, 2015, our credit facility was undrawn, and we had no commercial paper outstanding. In 2015, investing activities used $302 million compared with $377 million in 2014. For 2015, Capital expenditures were $551 million compared with $385 million in 2014. Capital expenditures in both periods were primarily for semiconductor manufacturing equipment. In 2015, we had sales of short-term investments, net of purchases, that provided cash of $125 million. In comparison, in 2014 we had purchases of short-term investments, net of sales, that used cash of $141 million. In addition, we had proceeds from sales of assets of $110 million in 2015 compared with $142 million in 2014. In 2015, financing activities used $4.17 billion compared with $3.94 billion in 2014. In both 2015 and 2014, we received proceeds of $498 million from the issuance of fixed-rate long-term debt (net of original issuance discount) and repaid $1.00 billion of maturing debt. Dividends paid in 2015 were $1.44 billion compared with $1.32 billion in 2014, reflecting increases in the dividend rate. During 2015, the quarterly dividend increased from $0.34 to $0.38 per share, resulting in an annualized dividend payment of $1.52 per share. During 2014, we increased our quarterly dividend from $0.30 to $0.34 per share. In 2015, we used $2.74 billion to repurchase 51.4 million shares of our common stock. This compared with $2.83 billion used in 2014 to repurchase 61.7 million shares. Employee exercises of stock options are also reflected in Cash flows from financing activities. In 2015, these exercises provided cash proceeds of $442 million compared with $616 million in 2014. We had $1.00 billion of Cash and cash equivalents and $2.22 billion of Short-term investments as of December 31, 2015, with our U.S. entities owning about 80 percent of these amounts combined at the end of 2015. We believe we have the necessary financial resources and operating plans to fund our working capital needs, capital expenditures, dividend and debt-related payments, and other business requirements for at least the next 12 months. Non-GAAP financial information This MD&A includes references to free cash flow and ratios based on that measure. These are financial measures that were not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP). Free cash flow was calculated by subtracting Capital expenditures from the most directly comparable GAAP measure, Cash flows from operating activities (also referred to as cash flow from operations). We believe that free cash flow and the associated ratios provide insight into our liquidity, our cash-generating capability and the amount of cash potentially available to return to investors, as well as insight into our financial performance. These non-GAAP measures are supplemental to the comparable GAAP measures. Reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP-based measures is provided in the table below. For Years Ended December 31, 2015 2014 2013 Cash flow from operations (GAAP) $ 4,268 $ 3,892 $ 3,384 Capital expenditures (551 ) (385 ) (412 ) Free cash flow (non-GAAP) $ 3,717 $ 3,507 $ 2,972 Revenue $ 13,000 $ 13,045 $ 12,205 Cash flow from operations as a percent of revenue (GAAP) 32.8 % 29.8 % 27.7 % Free cash flow as a percent of revenue (non-GAAP) 28.6 % 26.9 % 24.4 % 21 Long-term contractual obligations Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations 2016 2017/2018 2019/2020 Thereafter Total Long-term debt obligations (a) $ 1,083 $ 1,224 $ 1,312 $ 782 $ 4,401 Operating lease obligations (b) 69 90 40 62 261 Software license obligations (c) 30 2 — — 32 Purchase obligations (d) 95 94 50 1 240 Deferred compensation plan (e) 13 39 35 82 169 Total (f) $ 1,290 $ 1,449 $ 1,437 $ 927 $ 5,103 (a) Includes the related interest payments and amounts classified as the current portion of long-term debt, specifically obligations that will mature within 12 months. (b) Includes minimum payments for leased facilities and equipment and purchases of industrial gases under contracts accounted for as operating leases. (c) Includes payments under license agreements for electronic design automation software. (d) Includes contractual arrangements with suppliers where there is a fixed, non-cancellable payment schedule or minimum payments due with a reduced delivery schedule. Excluded from the table are cancellable arrangements. However, depending on when certain purchase arrangements may be cancelled, an additional $4 million of cancellation penalties may be required to be paid, which are not reflected in the table. (e) Includes an estimate of payments under this plan for the liability that existed at December 31, 2015. (f) Excluded from the table are $84 million of uncertain tax liabilities under ASC 740, as well as any planned future funding contributions to retirement benefit plans. Amounts associated with uncertain tax liabilities have been excluded because of the difficulty in making reasonably reliable estimates of the timing of cash settlements with the respective taxing authorities. Regarding future funding of retirement benefit plans, we plan to contribute about $100 million in 2016, but funding projections beyond 2016 are not practical to estimate due to the rules affecting tax-deductible contributions and the impact from the plans’ asset performance, interest rates and potential U.S. and non-U.S. legislation. Critical accounting policies In preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, we use statistical analyses, estimates and projections that affect the reported amounts and related disclosures and may vary from actual results. We consider the following accounting policies to be those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and that require the most subjective judgment. If actual results differ significantly from management’s estimates and projections, there could be a significant effect on our financial statements. Revenue recognition We recognize revenue from sales of our products, including direct sales to our distributors, when title and risk of loss pass, which usually occurs upon shipment or delivery to the customer or distributor, depending upon the terms of the sales order; when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; when sales amounts are fixed or determinable; and when collectability is reasonably assured. For sales to distributors, payment is due on our standard commercial terms and is not contingent upon resale of the products. We recognize revenue net of allowances, which are management’s estimates of future credits to be granted to customers or distributors under programs common in the semiconductor industry. These allowances are based on analysis of historical data, current economic conditions and contractual terms, and are recorded when revenue is recognized. Allowances may include volume-based incentives, product returns due to quality issues, incentives designed to maximize growth opportunities and special pricing arrangements. For instance, we sell to distributors at standard published prices, but we may grant them price adjustment credits in response to individual competitive opportunities. To estimate allowances, we use statistical percentages of revenue, which are determined quarterly based upon recent historical adjustment trends. Historical claims data are maintained for each of the programs, with differences among geographic regions taken into consideration. We continually monitor the actual claimed allowances against our estimates, and we adjust our estimates as appropriate to reflect trends in distributor revenue and inventory levels. Allowances are also adjusted when recent historical data do not represent anticipated future activity. We may also provide distributors an allowance to scrap certain slow-selling or obsolete products in their inventory, estimated as a negotiated fixed percentage of each distributor’s purchases from us. In addition, if we publish a new price for a product that is lower than that paid by distributors for the same product still remaining in each distributor’s on-hand inventory, we may credit them for the 22 difference between those prices. The allowance for this type of credit is based on the identified product price difference applied to our estimate of each distributor’s on-hand inventory of that product. We believe we can reasonably and reliably estimate allowances for credits to distributors in a timely manner. Revenue from sales of our products that are subject to inventory consignment agreements, including consignment arrangements with distributors, is recognized in accordance with the principles discussed above, but delivery occurs when the customer or distributor pulls product from consignment inventory that we store at designated locations. We determine the amount and timing of royalty revenue related to licenses of our patent portfolio based on our contractual agreements with licensees. We recognize royalty revenue when earned under the terms of the agreements and when we consider realization of payment to be probable. In addition, we record allowances for accounts receivable that we estimate may not be collected. We monitor collectability of accounts receivable primarily through review of the accounts receivable aging. When collection is at risk, we assess the impact on amounts recorded for bad debts and, if necessary, will record a charge in the period such determination is made. We include amounts received from customers for reimbursement of shipping fees in revenue. We include the costs of shipping and handling in COR. Income taxes In determining Net income for financial statement purposes, we must make certain estimates and judgments in the calculation of tax provisions and the resultant tax liabilities, and in the recoverability of deferred tax assets that arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense. In the ordinary course of global business, there may be many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. The calculation of tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. We recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on an estimate of the ultimate resolution of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. Although we believe the estimates are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these matters will not be different than what is reflected in the historical income tax provisions and accruals. As part of our financial process, we must assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets can be recovered. If recovery is not likely, the provision for taxes must be increased by recording a reserve in the form of a valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets that are estimated not to be ultimately recoverable. In this process, certain relevant criteria are evaluated including the existence of deferred tax liabilities that can be used to absorb deferred tax assets, the taxable income in prior years that can be used to absorb net operating losses and credit carrybacks, and taxable income in future years. Our judgment regarding future recoverability of our deferred tax assets based on these criteria may change due to various factors, including changes in U.S. or international tax laws and changes in market conditions and their impact on our assessment of taxable income in future periods. These changes, if any, may require material adjustments to the deferred tax assets and an accompanying reduction or increase in Net income in the period when such determinations are made. Also, our plans for the permanent reinvestment or eventual repatriation of the accumulated earnings of certain of our non-U.S. operations could change. Such changes could have a material effect on tax expense in future years. In addition to the factors described above, the effective tax rate reflected in forward-looking statements is based on then-current tax law. Significant changes in tax law enacted during the year could affect these estimates. Retroactive changes in tax law enacted subsequent to the end of a reporting period are reflected in the period of enactment as a discrete tax item. Inventory valuation allowances Inventory is valued net of allowances for unsalable or obsolete raw materials, work-in-process and finished goods. Statistical allowances are determined quarterly for raw materials and work-in-process based on historical disposals of inventory for salability and obsolescence reasons. For finished goods, quarterly statistical allowances are determined by comparing inventory levels of individual parts to historical shipments, current backlog and estimated future sales in order to identify inventory judged unlikely to be sold. A specific allowance for each material type will be carried if there is a significant event not captured by the statistical allowance. Examples are an end-of-life part or demand with imminent risk of cancellation. Allowances are also calculated quarterly for instances where inventoried costs for individual products are in excess of market prices for those products. Actual future write-offs of inventory for salability and obsolescence reasons may differ from estimates and calculations used to determine valuation allowances due to changes in customer demand, customer negotiations, technology shifts and other factors. 23 Changes in accounting standards See Note 2 to the financial statements for information on new accounting standards. Off-balance sheet arrangements As of December 31, 2015, we had no significant off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K. Commitments and contingencies See Note 12 to the financial statements for a discussion of our commitments and contingencies. ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. Foreign exchange risk The U.S. dollar is the functional currency for financial reporting. Our non-U.S. entities own assets or liabilities denominated in U.S. dollars or other currencies. Exchange rate fluctuations can have a significant impact on taxable income in those jurisdictions, and consequently on our effective tax rate. Our balance sheet also reflects amounts remeasured from non-U.S. dollar currencies. Because most of the aggregate non-U.S. dollar balance sheet exposure is hedged by forward currency exchange contracts, based on year-end 2015 balances and currency exchange rates, a hypothetical 10 percent plus or minus fluctuation in non-U.S. currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar would result in a pre-tax currency exchange gain or loss of less than $1 million. We use these forward currency exchange contracts to reduce the earnings impact exchange rate fluctuations may have on our non-U.S. dollar net balance sheet exposures. For example, at year-end 2015, we had forward currency exchange contracts outstanding with a notional value of $464 million to hedge net balance sheet exposures (including $175 million to sell Japanese yen and $139 million to sell euros). Similar hedging activities existed at year-end 2014. Interest rate risk We have the following potential exposure to changes in interest rates: (1) the effect of changes in interest rates on the fair value of our investments in cash equivalents and short-term investments, which could produce a gain or a loss; and (2) the effect of changes in interest rates on the fair value of our debt. As of December 31, 2015, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would decrease the fair value of our investments in cash equivalents and short-term investments by $6 million and decrease the fair value of our long-term debt by $111 million. Because interest rates on our long-term debt are fixed, changes in interest rates would not affect the cash flows associated with long-term debt. Equity risk Long-term investments at year-end 2015 include the following: · Investments in mutual funds – includes mutual funds that were selected to generate returns that offset changes in certain liabilities related to deferred compensation arrangements. The mutual funds hold a variety of debt and equity investments. · Investments in venture capital funds – includes investments in limited partnerships (accounted for under either the equity or cost method). · Equity investments – includes non-marketable (non-publicly traded) equity securities. Investments in mutual funds are stated at fair value. Changes in prices of the mutual fund investments are expected to offset related changes in deferred compensation liabilities such that a 10 percent increase or decrease in the investments' fair values would not materially affect operating results. Non-marketable equity securities and some venture capital funds are stated at cost. Impairments deemed to be other-than-temporary are expensed in Net income. Investments in the remaining venture capital funds are stated using the equity method. See Note 8 to the financial statements for details of equity and other long-term investments. 24",2023-12-30 17:49:12.419801
97476,TXN,TEXAS INSTRUMENTS INC,2017,"ITEM 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Overview We design, make and sell semiconductors to electronics designers and manufacturers all over the world. Our business model is carefully constructed around the following attributes: • Industry’s broadest portfolio of differentiated analog and embedded processing semiconductors. Our customers need multiple chips for their systems. The breadth of our portfolio means we can solve more of these needs than can our competitors, which gives us access to more customers and the opportunity to generate more revenue per system. We invest more than $1 billion each year to develop new products for our portfolio. • A strong foundation of manufacturing technology and low-cost production. We invest in manufacturing technologies that differentiate the features of our semiconductors, and we do most of our own production in-house, as opposed to outsourcing it. This ability to directly control our manufacturing helps ensure a consistent supply of products for our customers. We produce billions of semiconductors each year on a mixture of 150-, 200- and 300-millimeter wafers, and we are able to keep costs low for manufacturing facilities and equipment because our Analog and much of our Embedded Processing semiconductors can be made using mature assets that we acquire ahead of demand when their prices are most attractive. In 2016, we increased factory loadings by about 15 percent for our Analog semiconductors on 300-millimeter wafers, which have a 40 percent cost advantage per unpackaged chip over 200-millimeter wafers. The majority of our Analog growth will be produced on 300-millimeter wafers, which will be meaningful to the growth of our cash flow over the long term. • Industry’s largest market channels. Our global sales force is larger than those of our competitors. The breadth of our portfolio attracts an increasing number of visits to our website, where customers often begin their initial product searches and design-in journey. Our web presence, together with our global sales force, provides us unique access to about 100,000 customers. • Diversity and longevity in our products and in the markets we serve. Together, the attributes above result in diverse and long-lived positions that deliver high terminal value to our shareholders. Because of the breadth of our portfolio, we are not dependent on any single product, and because of the breadth of our markets we are not dependent on any single application or customer. Some of our products generate revenue for decades, which strengthens the return on our investments. The combined effect of these attributes is that over time we have grown free cash flow and gained market share in Analog and Embedded Processing. These attributes put us in a unique class of companies with the ability to grow, generate cash, and return that cash to shareholders. Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (MD&A) should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this document. In the following discussion of our results of operations: • All dollar amounts in the tables are stated in millions of U.S. dollars. • When we discuss our results: o Unless otherwise noted, changes in our revenue are attributable to changes in customer demand, which are evidenced by fluctuations in shipment volumes. o New products tend not to have a significant impact on our revenue in any given period because we sell such a large number of products. o From time to time, our revenue and gross profit are affected by changes in demand for higher-priced or lower-priced products, which we refer to as changes in the “mix” of products shipped. o Because we own much of our manufacturing capacity, a significant portion of our operating cost is fixed. When factory loadings decrease, our fixed costs are spread over reduced output and, absent other circumstances, our profit margins decrease. Conversely, as factory loadings increase, our fixed costs are spread over increased output and, absent other circumstances, our profit margins increase. Increases and decreases in factory loadings tend to correspond to increases and decreases in demand. o Over time, we have been allocating resources from areas like manufacturing support and SG&A into R&D activities. As a result, R&D expense will continue increasing in 2017. 17 o Our effective tax rate (Provision for income taxes as a percentage of Income before income taxes) benefits from lower tax rates (compared to the U.S. statutory income tax rate) applicable to our operations in many of the jurisdictions in which we operate and from U.S. tax benefits. These lower non-U.S. tax rates are generally statutory in nature, without expiration and available to companies that operate in those taxing jurisdictions. • Our segments represent groups of similar products that are combined on the basis of similar design and development requirements, product characteristics, manufacturing processes and distribution channels, and how management allocates resources and measures results. See Note 1 to the financial statements for more information regarding our segments. • In the fourth quarter of 2016, we adopted ASU 2016-09 related to stock compensation. We applied the new standard prospectively as of the beginning of 2016 for the Consolidated Statements of Income and on a full retrospective basis for all periods in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. See Note 2 to the financial statements for more details. Results of operations We continued to perform well in 2016, reflecting our focus on Analog and Embedded Processing. These products serve highly diverse markets with thousands of applications, and we believe have dependable long-term growth opportunities. In 2016, Analog and Embedded Processing represented 86 percent of revenue. Gross margin of 61.6 percent for the year reflects the quality of our product portfolio, as well as the efficiency of our manufacturing strategy. Our focus on Analog and Embedded Processing allows us to generate strong cash flow from operations. In 2016, cash flows from operations were $4.61 billion, up from $4.40 billion in 2015. Free cash flow in 2016 was 30.5 percent of revenue, up from 29.6 percent a year ago and consistent with our targeted range of 20-30 percent of revenue. During the year, we returned $3.78 billion of cash to investors through a combination of stock repurchases and dividends. Our dividends represented 40 percent of free cash flow, underscoring their sustainability. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure. For a reconciliation to GAAP and an explanation of the reason for providing this non-GAAP measure, see the Non-GAAP financial information section after the Liquidity and capital resources section. Details of financial results – 2016 compared with 2015 Revenue of $13.37 billion was up $370 million, or 3 percent, from 2015, due to higher revenue from Embedded Processing and Analog. Gross profit was $8.24 billion, an increase of $680 million, or 9 percent, due to lower manufacturing costs and, to a lesser extent, higher revenue. Gross profit margin was 61.6 percent compared with 58.2 percent. Operating expenses were $1.37 billion for R&D and $1.77 billion for SG&A. R&D expense increased $90 million, or 7 percent, due to a combination of our ongoing allocation of resources into R&D activities and higher compensation-related costs. SG&A expense increased $19 million, primarily due to higher compensation-related costs. Acquisition charges associated with our 2011 acquisition of National Semiconductor were $319 million compared with $329 million. These non-cash charges resulted from the amortization of intangible assets. See Note 13 to the financial statements. Restructuring charges/other was a net credit of $15 million, which included a gain on the sale of intellectual property of $40 million that was partially offset by $25 million related to restructuring charges. This compared with a net credit of $71 million in 2015, which included gains on sales of assets of $83 million that were partially offset by $12 million related to restructuring charges and other credits. These amounts are included in Other for segment reporting purposes. See Note 3 to the financial statements. Operating profit was $4.80 billion, or 35.9 percent of revenue, compared with $4.27 billion, or 32.9 percent of revenue. OI&E for 2016 was $211 million compared with $32 million. The increase is due to income of $188 million from settlements related to intellectual property infringement. Our income tax provision was $1.34 billion compared with $1.23 billion. The increase was primarily due to higher income before income taxes, partially offset by a tax benefit for stock compensation. Our effective tax rates were 27 percent in 2016 and 29 percent in 2015. See Note 6 to the financial statements for a reconciliation of the U.S. statutory income tax rate to the effective tax rate. Net income was $3.60 billion, an increase of $609 million, or 20 percent. EPS was $3.48 compared with $2.82. EPS benefited $0.13 in 2016 due to the application of the new accounting standard related to stock compensation. 18 Segment results – 2016 compared with 2015 Analog (included High Volume Analog & Logic (HVAL), Power Management (Power), High Performance Analog (HPA) and Silicon Valley Analog (SVA) product lines) 2016 2015 Change Revenue $ 8,536 $ 8,339 2 % Operating profit 3,380 3,048 11 % Operating profit % of revenue 39.6 % 36.6 % Analog revenue increased primarily due to SVA and HPA. Power also grew, but to a lesser extent, while HVAL declined due to the mix of products shipped. Operating profit increased due to higher gross profit, which benefited from lower manufacturing costs. Embedded Processing (included Processors, Microcontrollers and Connectivity product lines) 2016 2015 Change Revenue $ 3,023 $ 2,787 8 % Operating profit 801 596 34 % Operating profit % of revenue 26.5 % 21.4 % Embedded Processing revenue increased due to, in declining order, Processors, Microcontrollers and Connectivity. Processors revenue increased due to the mix of products shipped. Operating profit increased primarily due to higher revenue and associated gross profit. Other (included DLP products, calculators, custom ASICs and royalties) 2016 2015 Change Revenue $ 1,811 $ 1,874 (3 )% Operating profit* 618 630 (2 )% Operating profit % of revenue 34.1 % 33.6 % * Includes Acquisition charges and Restructuring charges/other Other revenue decreased due to, in declining order, lower royalties, custom ASIC products and calculators. This decrease was partially offset by growth in DLP products. Operating profit decreased $12 million. Prior results of operations In 2015, Analog revenue grew 3 percent, and Embedded Processing revenue grew 2 percent. Analog and Embedded Processing represented 86 percent of revenue in 2015, up from 83 percent in 2014. Gross margin was 58.2 percent for 2015. In 2015, cash flows from operations were $4.40 billion, up from $4.05 billion in 2014. Free cash flow in 2015, was 29.6 percent of revenue, up from 28.1 percent in 2014. During 2015, we returned $4.19 billion of cash to investors through a combination of stock repurchases and dividends. Details of financial results – 2015 compared with 2014 Revenue of $13.00 billion was about even with 2014, as higher revenue from Analog and Embedded Processing was offset by lower revenue from Other. Our 2015 revenue was negatively affected by about $150 million from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Gross profit was $7.56 billion, an increase of $133 million, or 2 percent, due to lower manufacturing costs. Gross profit margin was 58.2 percent of revenue compared with 56.9 percent. Operating expenses were $1.28 billion for R&D and $1.75 billion for SG&A. R&D expense decreased $78 million, or 6 percent, and SG&A decreased $95 million, or 5 percent. Both comparisons reflect savings from ongoing efforts across the company to align costs with growth opportunities, including the completed restructuring actions in Embedded Processing and Japan. These decreases were partially offset by higher compensation-related costs. 19 Acquisition charges were related to our 2011 acquisition of National Semiconductor and were $329 million, about even with 2014. These non-cash charges were primarily from the amortization of intangible assets. Restructuring charges/other was a net credit of $71 million, which included gains on sales of assets of $83 million that were partially offset by $12 million related to restructuring charges and other credits. This compared with a net credit of $51 million in 2014, reflecting gains on sales of assets of $75 million that were partially offset by restructuring charges and other expenses of $24 million. These amounts are included in Other for segment reporting purposes. Operating profit was $4.27 billion, or 32.9 percent of revenue, compared with $3.95 billion, or 30.3 percent of revenue, in 2014. The income tax provision was $1.23 billion compared with $1.05 billion. The increase in the total tax provision was due to higher income before income taxes and, to a lesser extent, a lower benefit from non-U.S. effective tax rates. Our effective tax rate was 29 percent in 2015 and 27 percent in 2014. Net income was $2.99 billion, an increase of $165 million, or 6 percent, from 2014. EPS was $2.82 compared with $2.57 in 2014. Segment results – 2015 compared with 2014 Analog 2015 2014 Change Revenue $ 8,339 $ 8,104 3 % Operating profit 3,048 2,786 9 % Operating profit % of revenue 36.6 % 34.4 % Analog revenue increased primarily due to HVAL. Power and SVA also grew, but to a lesser extent. HPA declined due to the mix of products shipped. Operating profit increased due to higher revenue and associated gross profit and, to a lesser extent, lower manufacturing costs. Embedded Processing 2015 2014 Change Revenue $ 2,787 $ 2,740 2 % Operating profit 596 384 55 % Operating profit % of revenue 21.4 % 14.0 % Embedded Processing revenue increased due about equally to Connectivity and Microcontrollers, which together offset a decline in Processors. Operating profit increased primarily due to lower operating expenses. Other 2015 2014 Change Revenue $ 1,874 $ 2,201 (15 )% Operating profit* 630 777 (19 )% Operating profit % of revenue 33.6 % 35.3 % * Includes Acquisition charges and Restructuring charges/other Other revenue declined primarily due to custom ASICs. Revenue from DLP products also declined, but to a lesser extent. Operating profit declined primarily due to lower revenue and associated gross profit. Financial condition At the end of 2016, total cash (Cash and cash equivalents plus Short-term investments) was $3.49 billion, an increase of $272 million from the end of 2015. 20 Accounts receivable were $1.27 billion at the end of 2016. This was an increase of $102 million compared with the end of 2015. Days sales outstanding were 33 at the end of both 2016 and 2015. Inventory was $1.79 billion at the end of 2016. This was an increase of $99 million from the end of 2015. Days of inventory at the end of 2016 were 126 compared with 115 at the end of 2015. Liquidity and capital resources Our primary source of liquidity is cash flow from operations. Additional sources of liquidity are Cash and cash equivalents, Short-term investments and a variable rate, revolving credit facility. Cash flows from operating activities for 2016 was $4.61 billion, an increase of $217 million from 2015 primarily due to an increase in Net income. Our revolving credit facility is with a consortium of investment-grade banks and allows us to borrow up to $2 billion until March 2021. This credit facility also serves as support for the issuance of commercial paper. As of December 31, 2016, our credit facility was undrawn, and we had no commercial paper outstanding. In 2016, investing activities used $650 million compared with $302 million in 2015. For 2016, Capital expenditures were $531 million compared with $551 million in 2015. Capital expenditures in both periods were primarily for semiconductor manufacturing equipment. In 2016, we had purchases of short-term investments, net of proceeds, that used cash of $113 million. In comparison, in 2015 we had proceeds from short-term investments, net of purchases, that provided cash of $125 million. In 2015, we received $110 million from asset sales, compared with none in 2016. In 2016, financing activities used $3.81 billion compared with $4.29 billion in 2015. In 2016, we received proceeds of $499 million from the issuance of fixed-rate, long-term debt (net of original issuance discount) and repaid $1.00 billion of maturing debt. In 2015, we received proceeds of $498 million from the issuance of fixed-rate, long-term debt (net of original issuance discount) and repaid $1.00 billion of maturing debt. Dividends paid in 2016 were $1.65 billion compared with $1.44 billion in 2015, reflecting increases in the dividend rate, partially offset by fewer shares outstanding. During 2016, the quarterly dividend increased to $0.50 from $0.38 per share, resulting in an annualized dividend payment of $2.00 per share. During 2015, we increased our quarterly dividend to $0.38 from $0.34 per share. In 2016, we used $2.13 billion to repurchase 35.5 million shares of our common stock. This compared with $2.74 billion used in 2015 to repurchase 51.4 million shares. Employee exercises of stock options are also reflected in Cash flows from financing activities. In 2016, these exercises provided cash proceeds of $472 million compared with $396 million in 2015. We had $1.15 billion of Cash and cash equivalents and $2.34 billion of Short-term investments as of December 31, 2016, with our U.S. entities owning about 80 percent of these amounts combined at the end of 2016. We believe we have the necessary financial resources and operating plans to fund our working capital needs, capital expenditures, dividend and debt-related payments, and other business requirements for at least the next 12 months. Non-GAAP financial information This MD&A includes references to free cash flow and ratios based on that measure. These are financial measures that were not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP). Free cash flow was calculated by subtracting Capital expenditures from the most directly comparable GAAP measure, Cash flows from operating activities (also referred to as cash flow from operations). We believe that free cash flow and the associated ratios provide insight into our liquidity, our cash-generating capability and the amount of cash potentially available to return to shareholders, as well as insight into our financial performance. These non-GAAP measures are supplemental to the comparable GAAP measures. Reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP-based measures is provided in the table below. For Years Ended December 31, 2016 2015 2014 Cash flow from operations (GAAP) $ 4,614 $ 4,397 $ 4,054 Capital expenditures (531 ) (551 ) (385 ) Free cash flow (non-GAAP) $ 4,083 $ 3,846 $ 3,669 Revenue $ 13,370 $ 13,000 $ 13,045 Cash flow from operations as a percent of revenue (GAAP) 34.5 % 33.8 % 31.1 % Free cash flow as a percent of revenue (non-GAAP) 30.5 % 29.6 % 28.1 % 21 Long-term contractual obligations Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations 2017 2018/2019 2020/2021 Thereafter Total Long-term debt (a) $ 692 $ 1,350 $ 806 $ 1,021 $ 3,869 Purchase commitments (b) 132 173 26 5 336 Operating leases (c) 67 75 41 57 240 Deferred compensation plans (d) 18 38 37 99 192 Total (e) $ 909 $ 1,636 $ 910 $ 1,182 $ 4,637 (a) Includes the related interest payments and amounts classified as the current portion of long-term debt, specifically obligations that will mature within 12 months. (b) Includes payments for software licenses and contractual arrangements with suppliers where there is a fixed, non-cancellable payment schedule or minimum payments due with a reduced delivery schedule. Excluded from the table are cancellable arrangements. However, depending on when certain purchase arrangements may be cancelled, an additional $3 million of cancellation penalties may be required to be paid, which are not reflected in the table. (c) Includes minimum payments for leased facilities and equipment and purchases of industrial gases under contracts accounted for as operating leases. (d) Includes an estimate of payments for certain liabilities that existed at December 31, 2016. (e) Excluded from the table are $243 million of uncertain tax liabilities under ASC 740, as well as any planned future funding contributions to retirement benefit plans. Amounts associated with uncertain tax liabilities have been excluded because of the difficulty in making reasonably reliable estimates of the timing of cash settlements with the respective taxing authorities. Regarding future funding of retirement benefit plans, we plan to contribute about $100 million in 2017, but funding projections beyond 2017 are not practical to estimate due to the rules affecting tax-deductible contributions and the impact from the plans' asset performance, interest rates and potential U.S. and non-U.S. legislation. Critical accounting policies In preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, we use statistical analyses, estimates and projections that affect the reported amounts and related disclosures and may vary from actual results. We consider the following accounting policies to be those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and that require the most subjective judgment. If actual results differ significantly from management’s estimates and projections, there could be a significant effect on our financial statements. Revenue recognition We recognize revenue from sales of our products, including sales to our distributors, when title and risk of loss pass, which usually occurs upon shipment or delivery to the customer or distributor, depending upon the terms of the sales order; when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; when sales amounts are fixed or determinable; and when collectability is reasonably assured. For sales to distributors, payment is due on our standard commercial terms and is not contingent upon resale of the products. Revenue from sales of our products that are subject to inventory consignment agreements, including consignment arrangements with distributors, is recognized in accordance with the principles discussed above. Delivery occurs when the customer or distributor pulls product from consignment inventory that we store at designated locations. We recognize revenue net of allowances, which are management’s estimates of future credits to be granted to customers or distributors under programs common in the semiconductor industry. These allowances, which are not material, generally include volume-based incentives, product returns due to quality issues, incentives designed to maximize growth opportunities and special pricing arrangements. Allowances are based on analysis of historical data, current economic conditions and contractual terms and are recorded when revenue is recognized. We believe we can reasonably and reliably estimate allowances for credits to distributors in a timely manner. In addition, we record allowances for accounts receivable that we estimate may not be collected. We monitor collectability of accounts receivable primarily through review of the accounts receivable aging. When collection is at risk, we assess the impact on amounts recorded for bad debts and, if necessary, will record a charge in the period such determination is made. We recognize in revenue shipping fees, if any, received from customers. We include shipping and handling costs in cost of revenue. The majority of our customers pay these fees directly to third parties. 22 Income taxes In determining Net income for financial statement purposes, we must make certain estimates and judgments in the calculation of tax provisions and the resultant tax liabilities, and in the recoverability of deferred tax assets that arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense. In the ordinary course of global business, there may be many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. The calculation of tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. We recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on an estimate of the ultimate resolution of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. Although we believe the estimates are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these matters will not be different than what is reflected in the historical income tax provisions and accruals. As part of our financial process, we must assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets can be recovered. If recovery is not likely, the provision for taxes must be increased by recording a reserve in the form of a valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets that are estimated not to be ultimately recoverable. In this process, certain relevant criteria are evaluated, including the existence of deferred tax liabilities that can be used to absorb deferred tax assets, the taxable income in prior years that can be used to absorb net operating losses and credit carrybacks, and taxable income in future years. Our judgment regarding future recoverability of our deferred tax assets based on these criteria may change due to various factors, including changes in U.S. or international tax laws and changes in market conditions and their impact on our assessment of taxable income in future periods. These changes, if any, may require material adjustments to the deferred tax assets and an accompanying reduction or increase in Net income in the period when such determinations are made. Also, our plans for the permanent reinvestment or eventual repatriation of the accumulated earnings of certain of our non-U.S. operations could change. Such changes could have a material effect on tax expense in future years. In addition to the factors described above, the estimated annual tax rate, which excludes discrete items, reflected in forward-looking statements is based on then-current tax law. Significant changes in tax law enacted during the year could affect these estimates. Retroactive changes in tax law enacted subsequent to the end of a reporting period are reflected in the period of enactment. Inventory valuation allowances Inventory is valued net of allowances for unsalable or obsolete raw materials, work-in-process and finished goods. Statistical allowances are determined quarterly for raw materials and work-in-process based on historical disposals of inventory for salability and obsolescence reasons. For finished goods, quarterly statistical allowances are determined by comparing inventory levels of individual parts to historical shipments, current backlog and estimated future sales in order to identify inventory judged unlikely to be sold. A specific allowance for each material type will be carried if there is a significant event not captured by the statistical allowance. Examples are an end-of-life part or demand with imminent risk of cancellation. Allowances are also calculated quarterly for instances where inventoried costs for individual products are in excess of market prices for those products. Actual future write-offs of inventory for salability and obsolescence reasons may differ from estimates and calculations used to determine valuation allowances due to changes in customer demand, customer negotiations, technology shifts and other factors. Changes in accounting standards See Note 2 to the financial statements for information on new accounting standards. Off-balance sheet arrangements As of December 31, 2016, we had no significant off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K. Commitments and contingencies See Note 12 to the financial statements for a discussion of our commitments and contingencies. ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. Foreign exchange risk The U.S. dollar is the functional currency for financial reporting. Our non-U.S. entities own assets or liabilities denominated in U.S. dollars or other currencies. Exchange rate fluctuations can have a significant impact on taxable income in those jurisdictions, and consequently on our effective tax rate. 23 Our balance sheet also reflects amounts remeasured from non-U.S. dollar currencies. Because most of the aggregate non-U.S. dollar balance sheet exposure is hedged by forward currency exchange contracts, based on year-end 2016 balances and currency exchange rates, a hypothetical 10 percent plus or minus fluctuation in non-U.S. currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar would result in a pre-tax currency exchange gain or loss of about $1 million. We use these forward currency exchange contracts to reduce the earnings impact exchange rate fluctuations may have on our non-U.S. dollar net balance sheet exposures. For example, at year-end 2016, we had forward currency exchange contracts outstanding with a notional value of $494 million to hedge net balance sheet exposures (including $158 million to sell Japanese yen and $123 million to sell euros). Similar hedging activities existed at year-end 2015. Interest rate risk We have the following potential exposure to changes in interest rates: (1) the effect of changes in interest rates on the fair value of our investments in cash equivalents and short-term investments, which could produce a gain or a loss; and (2) the effect of changes in interest rates on the fair value of our debt. As of December 31, 2016, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would decrease the fair value of our investments in cash equivalents and short-term investments by $7 million and decrease the fair value of our long-term debt by $104 million. Because interest rates on our long-term debt are fixed, changes in interest rates would not affect the cash flows associated with long-term debt. Equity risk Long-term investments at year-end 2016 include the following: • Investments in mutual funds – includes mutual funds that were selected to generate returns that offset changes in certain liabilities related to deferred compensation arrangements. The mutual funds hold a variety of debt and equity investments. • Investments in venture capital funds – includes investments in limited partnerships (accounted for under either the equity or cost method). • Equity investments – includes non-marketable (non-publicly traded) equity securities. Investments in mutual funds are stated at fair value. Changes in prices of the mutual fund investments are expected to offset related changes in deferred compensation liabilities such that a 10 percent increase or decrease in the investments' fair values would not materially affect operating results. Non-marketable equity securities and some venture capital funds are stated at cost. Impairments deemed to be other-than-temporary are expensed in Net income. Investments in the remaining venture capital funds are stated using the equity method. See Note 8 to the financial statements for details of equity and other long-term investments. 24",2023-12-30 17:49:12.210143
97476,TXN,TEXAS INSTRUMENTS INC,2018,"ITEM 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Overview We design, make and sell semiconductors to electronics designers and manufacturers all over the world. Our business model is designed around the following four sustainable competitive advantages, that we believe, in combination, put us in a unique class of companies: • A strong foundation of manufacturing and technology. We invest in manufacturing technologies and do most of our manufacturing in-house. This strategic decision to directly control our manufacturing helps ensure a consistent supply of products for our customers and also allows us to invest in technology that differentiates the features of our products. We have focused on creating a competitive manufacturing cost advantage by increasing factory loadings of our advanced analog 300-millimeter wafers, which have about a 40 percent cost advantage per unpackaged chip over 200-millimeter wafers. 300-millimeter wafers will support the majority of our Analog growth going forward. Additionally, we keep our manufacturing costs low by using mature assets acquired ahead of demand when their prices are most attractive. • Broad portfolio of differentiated analog and embedded processing semiconductors. Our customers need multiple chips for their systems. The breadth of our portfolio means we can solve more of these needs than our competitors, which gives us access to more customers and the opportunity to sell more products and generate more revenue per customer system. We invest more than $1 billion each year to develop new products for our portfolio, which includes tens of thousands of products. • Broadest reach of market channels. Customers often begin their initial product selection process and design-in journey on our website, and the breadth of our portfolio attracts more customers to our website than any of our competitors. Our web presence, combined with our global sales force that is also greater in size than those of our competitors, are advantages that give us unique access to about 100,000 customers designing TI semiconductors into their end products. • Diversity and longevity of our products, markets and customer positions. Together, the attributes above result in diverse and long-lived positions that deliver high terminal value to our shareholders. Because of the breadth of our portfolio, we are not dependent on any single product, and because of the breadth of our markets we are not dependent on any single application or customer. Some of our products generate revenue for decades, which strengthens the return on our investments. Our strategic focus, and where we invest the majority of our resources, is on Analog and Embedded Processing, with a particular emphasis on designing and selling those products into the industrial and automotive markets, which we believe represent the best growth opportunities. Analog and embedded processing products sold into industrial and automotive markets provide long product life cycles, intrinsic diversity, and less capital-intensive manufacturing, which we believe offer stability, profitability and strong cash generation. This business model is the foundation of our capital management strategy, which is based on our belief that free cash flow growth, especially on a per share basis, is important for maximizing shareholder value over the long term. We also believe that free cash flow will be valued only if it is productively invested in the business or returned to shareholders. The combined effect of these sustainable competitive advantages is that over time we have gained market share in Analog and Embedded Processing and have grown free cash flow. Our business model puts us in a unique class of companies with the ability to grow, generate cash, and return that cash to shareholders. Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (MD&A) should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this document. In the following discussion of our results of operations: • Our segments represent groups of similar products that are combined on the basis of similar design and development requirements, product characteristics, manufacturing processes and distribution channels, and how management allocates resources and measures results. See Note 1 to the financial statements for more information regarding our segments. • All dollar amounts in the tables are stated in millions of U.S. dollars. • When we discuss our results: o Unless otherwise noted, changes in our revenue are attributable to changes in customer demand, which are evidenced by fluctuations in shipment volumes. o New products tend not to have a significant impact on our revenue in any given period because we sell such a large number of products. 17 o From time to time, our revenue and gross profit are affected by changes in demand for higher-priced or lower-priced products, which we refer to as changes in the “mix” of products shipped. o Because we own much of our manufacturing capacity, a significant portion of our operating cost is fixed. When factory loadings decrease, our fixed costs are spread over reduced output and, absent other circumstances, our profit margins decrease. Conversely, as factory loadings increase, our fixed costs are spread over increased output and, absent other circumstances, our profit margins increase. Increases and decreases in factory loadings tend to correspond to increases and decreases in demand. o Over time, we have been allocating resources from areas like manufacturing support and SG&A into R&D activities. • The recently enacted U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act) will reduce our annual operating tax rate, which does not include discrete tax items, from 31 percent in 2017 to an ongoing rate of about 18 percent starting in 2019, comprehending the benefits of exports and having manufacturing, R&D and intellectual property in the United States. In 2018, our annual operating tax rate is expected to be about 23 percent, 5 percentage points higher, primarily due to a transitional non-cash expense. For an explanation of the term “annual operating tax rate,” see the Non-GAAP financial information section after the Liquidity and capital resources section. • In the first quarter of 2017, we adopted ASU 2017-07 related to certain pension and other retiree benefit costs. We applied the new standard on a full retrospective basis for all periods presented in the Consolidated Statements of Income, which have been recast as a result. See Note 2 to the financial statements for more details. • As of January 1, 2017, we no longer recognize royalties as revenue; instead, they are recorded as OI&E. We continue to receive royalties from arrangements involving license rights to our patent portfolio. Although we expect royalties to continue for many years, they are of decreasing significance to our core operations. Results of operations We continued to perform well in 2017, reflecting our focus on Analog and Embedded Processing, with a particular emphasis on the industrial and automotive markets. These products serve highly diverse markets with thousands of applications and have long-term growth opportunities. In 2017, Analog and Embedded Processing represented 90 percent of revenue. Gross margin of 64.3 percent reflected the quality of our product portfolio, as well as the efficiency of our manufacturing strategy. Our focus on Analog and Embedded Processing allows us to generate strong cash flow from operations. Our cash flow from operations of $5.36 billion underscored the strength of our business model. Free cash flow was $4.67 billion and represented 31.2 percent of revenue, up from 30.5 percent a year ago. During 2017, we returned $4.66 billion to shareholders through a combination of stock repurchases and dividends, consistent with our strategy to return all of our free cash flow to shareholders. Our dividends represented 45 percent of free cash flow, underscoring their sustainability. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure. See the Non-GAAP financial information section. Details of financial results – 2017 compared with 2016 Revenue of $14.96 billion was up $1.59 billion, or 12 percent, due to higher revenue from Analog and Embedded Processing. Gross profit of $9.61 billion was up $1.36 billion, or 16 percent, primarily due to higher revenue. As a percentage of revenue, gross profit increased to 64.3 percent from 61.8 percent. Operating expenses (R&D and SG&A) were $3.20 billion compared with $3.10 billion, as we continued our ongoing allocation of resources to R&D activities. Acquisition charges of $318 million were non-cash. See Note 13 to the financial statements. Restructuring charges/other was a charge of $11 million compared with a credit of $15 million in 2016. These amounts are included in Other for segment reporting purposes. See Note 3 to the financial statements. Operating profit was $6.08 billion, or 40.7 percent of revenue, compared with $4.86 billion, or 36.3 percent of revenue. OI&E was $75 million of income compared with $155 million in 2016. See Note 13 to the financial statements. 18 Our Provision for income taxes was $2.40 billion compared with $1.34 billion. The increase was due to the enactment of the Tax Act and, to a lesser extent, higher income before income taxes. Our effective tax rate, which includes discrete tax items, was 39 percent in 2017 and 27 percent in 2016. This change was due to tax adjustments made in 2017 as a result of the Tax Act. See Note 6 to the financial statements for a reconciliation of the U.S. statutory income tax rate to the effective tax rate. Net income was $3.68 billion compared with $3.60 billion. EPS was $3.61 compared with $3.48.

Operating profit decreased $150 million. Details of financial results – 2016 compared with 2015 Revenue of $13.37 billion was up $370 million, or 3 percent, from 2015 due to higher revenue from Embedded Processing and Analog. Gross profit was $8.26 billion, an increase of $682 million, or 9 percent, due to lower manufacturing costs and, to a lesser extent, higher revenue. Gross profit margin was 61.8 percent compared with 58.3 percent. Operating expenses were $1.36 billion for R&D and $1.74 billion for SG&A. R&D expense increased $89 million, or 7 percent, due to a combination of our allocation of resources into R&D activities and higher compensation-related costs. SG&A expense increased $14 million, primarily due to higher compensation-related costs. Acquisition charges associated with our 2011 acquisition of National Semiconductor were $319 million compared with $329 million. These non-cash charges resulted from the amortization of intangible assets. See Note 13 to the financial statements. 19 Restructuring charges/other was a credit of $15 million, which included a gain on the sale of intellectual property of $40 million that was partially offset by $25 million related to restructuring charges. This compared with a credit of $71 million in 2015, which included gains on sales of assets of $83 million that were partially offset by $12 million related to restructuring charges and other credits. These amounts are included in Other for segment reporting purposes. See Note 3 to the financial statements. Operating profit was $4.86 billion, or 36.3 percent of revenue, compared with $4.32 billion, or 33.2 percent of revenue. OI&E was $155 million of income compared with $16 million of expense. The increase is due to income of $188 million from settlements related to intellectual property infringement. Our income tax provision was $1.34 billion compared with $1.23 billion. The increase was primarily due to higher income before income taxes, partially offset by a tax benefit for stock compensation. Our annual operating tax rates, which do not include discrete tax items, were 30 percent in 2016 and 29 percent in 2015. Our effective tax rates were 27 percent in 2016 and 29 percent in 2015. Net income was $3.60 billion, an increase of $609 million, or 20 percent. EPS was $3.48 compared with $2.82. EPS benefited $0.13 in 2016 due to the adoption of a stock compensation accounting standard.

This decrease was partially offset by growth in DLP products. Operating profit decreased $12 million. Financial condition At the end of 2017, total cash (Cash and cash equivalents plus Short-term investments) was $4.47 billion, an increase of $979 million from the end of 2016. Accounts receivable were $1.28 billion at the end of 2017, an increase of $11 million compared with the end of 2016. Days sales outstanding at the end of 2017 were 31 compared with 33 at the end of 2016. 20 Inventory was $1.96 billion at the end of 2017, an increase of $167 million from the end of 2016. Days of inventory at the end of 2017 were 134 compared with 126 at the end of 2016. Liquidity and capital resources Our primary source of liquidity is cash flow from operations. Additional sources of liquidity are Cash and cash equivalents, Short-term investments and a variable rate, revolving credit facility. Cash flows from operating activities for 2017 was $5.36 billion, an increase of $749 million from 2016 that was driven by an increase in Income before income taxes. Our revolving credit facility is with a consortium of investment-grade banks and allows us to borrow up to $2 billion until March 2022. This credit facility also serves as support for the issuance of commercial paper. As of December 31, 2017, our credit facility was undrawn, and we had no commercial paper outstanding. In 2017, investing activities used $1.13 billion compared with $650 million in 2016. For 2017, Capital expenditures were $695 million compared with $531 million in 2016. Capital expenditures in both periods were primarily for semiconductor manufacturing equipment. In 2017, we had purchases of short-term investments, net of sales, that used cash of $460 million compared with $113 million in 2016. In 2017, we received $40 million from asset sales compared with none in 2016. In 2017, financing activities used $3.73 billion compared with $3.81 billion in 2016. In 2017, we received net proceeds of $1.10 billion from the issuance of fixed-rate, long-term debt and repaid $625 million of maturing debt. In 2016, we received net proceeds of $499 million from the issuance of fixed-rate, long-term debt and repaid $1.00 billion of maturing debt. Dividends paid in 2017 were $2.10 billion compared with $1.65 billion in 2016. During 2017, the quarterly dividend increased to $0.62 from $0.50 per share, resulting in an annualized dividend payment of $2.48 per share. During 2016, we increased our quarterly dividend to $0.50 from $0.38 per share. In 2017, we used $2.56 billion to repurchase 30.6 million shares of our common stock. This compared with $2.13 billion used in 2016 to repurchase 35.5 million shares. In 2017, employee exercises of stock options provided cash proceeds of $483 million compared with $472 million in 2016. We had $1.66 billion of Cash and cash equivalents and $2.81 billion of Short-term investments as of December 31, 2017, with our U.S. entities owning about 80 percent of these amounts combined at the end of 2017. We believe we have the necessary financial resources and operating plans to fund our working capital needs, capital expenditures, dividend and debt-related payments, and other business requirements for at least the next 12 months. In 2017, we recorded a provisional tax liability of $690 million on indefinitely reinvested earnings of our non-U.S. subsidiaries related to the enactment of the Tax Act. This amount will be paid over eight years and is not expected to have a significant impact on our liquidity. 21 Non-GAAP financial information This MD&A includes references to free cash flow and ratios based on that measure. These are financial measures that were not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP). Free cash flow was calculated by subtracting Capital expenditures from the most directly comparable GAAP measure, Cash flows from operating activities (also referred to as cash flow from operations). We believe that free cash flow and the associated ratios provide insight into our liquidity, our cash-generating capability and the amount of cash potentially available to return to shareholders, as well as insight into our financial performance. These non-GAAP measures are supplemental to the comparable GAAP measures. Reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP-based measures is provided in the table below. For Years Ended December 31, 2017 2016 2015 Cash flow from operations (GAAP) $ 5,363 $ 4,614 $ 4,397 Capital expenditures (695 ) (531 ) (551 ) Free cash flow (non-GAAP) $ 4,668 $ 4,083 $ 3,846 Revenue $ 14,961 $ 13,370 $ 13,000 Cash flow from operations as a percent of revenue (GAAP) 35.8 % 34.5 % 33.8 % Free cash flow as a percent of revenue (non-GAAP) 31.2 % 30.5 % 29.6 % This MD&A also includes references to an annual operating tax rate, a non-GAAP term we use to describe the estimated annual effective tax rate, a GAAP measure that by definition does not include discrete tax items. We believe the term annual operating tax rate more clearly communicates that discrete tax items are excluded from such rate. The term also helps differentiate from the effective tax rate, which includes discrete tax items. No adjustments are made to the estimated annual effective tax rate when using the term annual operating tax rate. Long-term contractual obligations Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations 2018 2019/2020 2021/2022 Thereafter Total Long-term debt (a) $ 581 $ 1,385 $ 1,133 $ 1,385 $ 4,484 Purchase commitments (b) 391 601 67 35 1,094 Tax on indefinitely reinvested earnings (c) 55 110 110 415 690 Operating leases (d) 68 94 53 56 271 Deferred compensation plans (e) 15 49 51 112 227 Total (f) $ 1,110 $ 2,239 $ 1,414 $ 2,003 $ 6,766 (a) Includes the related interest payments and amounts classified as the current portion of long-term debt, specifically obligations that will mature within 12 months. (b) Includes payments for software licenses and contractual arrangements with suppliers where there is a fixed, non-cancellable payment schedule or minimum payments due with a reduced delivery schedule. Excluded from the table are cancellable arrangements. (c) Includes the provisional amount of the tax on indefinitely reinvested earnings related to the enactment of the Tax Act. See Note 6 to the financial statements for more details. (d) Includes minimum payments for leased facilities and equipment and purchases of industrial gases under contracts accounted for as operating leases. (e) Includes an estimate of payments for certain liabilities that existed at December 31, 2017. (f) Excluded from the table are $300 million of uncertain tax liabilities under ASC 740, as well as any planned future funding contributions to retirement benefit plans. Amounts associated with uncertain tax liabilities have been excluded because of the difficulty in making reasonably reliable estimates of the timing of cash settlements with the respective taxing authorities. Regarding future funding of retirement benefit plans, we plan to contribute about $50 million in 2018, but funding projections beyond 2018 are not practical to estimate due to the rules affecting tax-deductible contributions and the impact from the plans' asset performance, interest rates and potential U.S. and non-U.S. legislation. 22 Critical accounting policies Our accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements. As disclosed in Note 2, the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. However, based on facts and circumstances inherent in developing estimates and assumptions, management believes it is unlikely that applying other estimates and assumptions would have a material impact on the financial statements. We consider the following accounting policies to be those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and that require a higher degree of judgment. Revenue recognition Based on management’s assessment of the revenue recognition criteria, we usually recognize revenue from sales of our products to distributors upon shipment or delivery to the distributors. For our consignment arrangements with distributors, delivery occurs when the distributor pulls product from consignment inventory that we store at designated locations. Recognition is not contingent upon resale of the products to the distributors’ customers in either scenario. Revenue is recognized net of allowances, which are management’s estimates of future credits to be granted to distributors under programs common in the semiconductor industry. These allowances are not material and generally include special pricing arrangements, product returns due to quality issues, and incentives designed to maximize growth opportunities. Allowances are based on analysis of historical data and contractual terms and are recorded when revenue is recognized. We believe we can reasonably and reliably estimate allowances for credits to distributors in a timely manner. Income taxes In determining Net income for financial statement purposes, we must make certain estimates and judgments in the calculation of tax provisions and the resultant tax liabilities, and in the recoverability of deferred tax assets that arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense. In the ordinary course of global business, there may be many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. The calculation of tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. We recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the United States and other tax jurisdictions based on an estimate of the ultimate resolution of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. Although we believe the estimates are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these matters will not be different than what is reflected in the historical income tax provisions and accruals. As part of our financial process, we must assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets can be recovered. If recovery is not likely, the provision for taxes must be increased by recording a reserve in the form of a valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets that are estimated not to be ultimately recoverable. In this process, certain relevant criteria are evaluated including the existence of deferred tax liabilities that can be used to absorb deferred tax assets, the taxable income in prior years that can be used to absorb net operating losses and credit carrybacks, and taxable income in future years. Our judgment regarding future recoverability of our deferred tax assets based on these criteria may change due to various factors, including changes in U.S. or international tax laws and changes in market conditions and their impact on our assessment of taxable income in future periods. These changes, if any, may require material adjustments to the deferred tax assets and an accompanying reduction or increase in Net income in the period when such determinations are made. Also, our plans for the permanent reinvestment or eventual repatriation of the accumulated earnings of certain non-U.S. operations could change. Such changes could have a material effect on tax expense in future years. Inventory valuation allowances Inventory is valued net of allowances for unsalable or obsolete raw materials, work-in-process and finished goods. Statistical allowances are determined quarterly for raw materials and work-in-process based on historical disposals of inventory for salability and obsolescence reasons. For finished goods, quarterly statistical allowances are determined by comparing inventory levels of individual parts to historical shipments, current backlog and estimated future sales in order to identify inventory judged unlikely to be sold. A specific allowance for each material type will be carried if there is a significant event not captured by the statistical allowance. Examples are an end-of-life part or demand with imminent risk of cancellation. Allowances are also calculated quarterly for instances where inventoried costs for individual products are in excess of market prices for those products. Actual future write-offs of inventory for salability and obsolescence reasons may differ from estimates and calculations used to determine valuation allowances due to changes in customer demand, customer negotiations, technology shifts and other factors. 23 Changes in accounting standards See Note 2 to the financial statements for information on new accounting standards. Off-balance sheet arrangements As of December 31, 2017, we had no significant off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K. Commitments and contingencies See Note 12 to the financial statements for a discussion of our commitments and contingencies. ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. Foreign exchange risk The U.S. dollar is the functional currency for financial reporting. Our non-U.S. entities own assets or liabilities denominated in U.S. dollars or other currencies. Exchange rate fluctuations can have a significant impact on taxable income in those jurisdictions, and consequently on our effective tax rate. Our balance sheet also reflects amounts remeasured from non-U.S. dollar currencies. Because most of the aggregate non-U.S. dollar balance sheet exposure is hedged by forward currency exchange contracts, based on year-end 2017 balances and currency exchange rates, a hypothetical 10 percent plus or minus fluctuation in non-U.S. currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar would result in a pre-tax currency exchange gain or loss of about $6 million. We use these forward currency exchange contracts to reduce the earnings impact exchange rate fluctuations may have on our non-U.S. dollar net balance sheet exposures. For example, at year-end 2017, we had forward currency exchange contracts outstanding with a notional value of $365 million to hedge net balance sheet exposures (including $140 million to sell Japanese yen, $59 million to sell British pound sterling and $49 million to sell euros). Similar hedging activities existed at year-end 2016. Interest rate risk We have the following potential exposure to changes in interest rates: (1) the effect of changes in interest rates on the fair value of our investments in cash equivalents and short-term investments, which could produce a gain or a loss; and (2) the effect of changes in interest rates on the fair value of our debt. As of December 31, 2017, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would decrease the fair value of our investments in cash equivalents and short-term investments by $8 million and decrease the fair value of our long-term debt by $141 million. Because interest rates on our long-term debt are fixed, changes in interest rates would not affect the cash flows associated with long-term debt. Equity risk Long-term investments at year-end 2017 include the following: • Investments in mutual funds – includes mutual funds that were selected to generate returns that offset changes in certain liabilities related to deferred compensation arrangements. The mutual funds hold a variety of debt and equity investments. • Investments in venture capital funds – includes investments in limited partnerships (accounted for under either the equity or cost method). • Equity investments – includes non-marketable (non-publicly traded) equity securities. Investments in mutual funds are stated at fair value. Changes in prices of the mutual fund investments are expected to offset related changes in deferred compensation liabilities such that a 10 percent increase or decrease in the investments' fair values would not materially affect operating results. Non-marketable equity securities and some venture capital funds are stated at cost. Impairments deemed to be other-than-temporary are expensed in Net income. Investments in the remaining venture capital funds are stated using the equity method. See Note 8 to the financial statements for details of equity and other long-term investments. 24",2023-12-30 17:49:12.129238
97476,TXN,TEXAS INSTRUMENTS INC,2019,"ITEM 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Overview We design, make and sell semiconductors to electronics designers and manufacturers all over the world. Our business model is designed around the following four sustainable competitive advantages that we believe, in combination, put us in a unique class of companies: • A strong foundation of manufacturing and technology. We invest in manufacturing technologies and do most of our manufacturing in-house. This strategic decision to directly control our manufacturing helps ensure a consistent supply of products for our customers and also allows us to invest in technology that differentiates the features of our products. We have focused on creating a competitive manufacturing cost advantage by investing in our advanced analog 300-millimeter capacity, which has about a 40 percent cost advantage per unpackaged chip over 200-millimeter. To strengthen this advantage, we are planning our next phase of 300-millimeter capacity expansion as 300-millimeter wafers will continue to support the majority of our Analog growth. • Broad portfolio of differentiated analog and embedded processing semiconductors. Our customers need multiple chips for their systems. The breadth of our portfolio means we can meet more of these needs than our competitors can, which gives us access to more customers and the opportunity to sell more products and generate more revenue per customer system. We invest more than $1 billion each year to develop new products for our portfolio, which includes tens of thousands of products. • Broadest reach of market channels. Customers often begin their initial product selection process and design-in journey on our website, and the breadth of our portfolio attracts more customers to our website than any of our competitors’ websites. Our web presence, combined with our global sales force that is also greater in size than those of our competitors, are advantages that give us unique access to about 100,000 customers designing TI semiconductors into their end products. • Diversity and longevity of our products, markets and customer positions. Together, the attributes above result in diverse and long-lived positions that deliver high terminal value to our shareholders. Because of the breadth of our portfolio, we are not dependent on any single product, customer, technology or market. Some of our products generate revenue for decades, which strengthens the return on our investments. Our strategic focus, and where we invest the majority of our resources, is on Analog and Embedded Processing, with a particular emphasis on designing and selling those products into the industrial and automotive markets, which we believe represent the best growth opportunities. Analog and embedded processing products sold into industrial and automotive markets provide long product life cycles, intrinsic diversity and less capital-intensive manufacturing, which we believe offer stability, profitability and strong cash generation. This business model is the foundation of our capital management strategy, which is based on our belief that free cash flow growth, especially on a per-share basis, is important for maximizing shareholder value over the long term. We also believe that free cash flow will be valued only if it is productively invested in the business or returned to shareholders. The combined effect of these sustainable competitive advantages is that over time we have gained market share in Analog and Embedded Processing and have grown free cash flow. Our business model puts us in a unique class of companies with the ability to grow, generate cash and return that cash to shareholders. Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (MD&A) should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this document. In the following discussion of our results of operations: • Our segments represent groups of similar products that are combined on the basis of similar design and development requirements, product characteristics, manufacturing processes and distribution channels, and how management allocates resources and measures results. See Note 1 to the financial statements for more information regarding our segments. • When we discuss our results: o Unless otherwise noted, changes in our revenue are attributable to changes in customer demand, which are evidenced by fluctuations in shipment volumes. o New products tend not to have a significant impact on our revenue in any given period because we sell such a large number of products. o From time to time, our revenue and gross profit are affected by changes in demand for higher-priced or lower-priced products, which we refer to as changes in the “mix” of products shipped. 16 o Because we own much of our manufacturing capacity, a significant portion of our operating cost is fixed. When factory loadings decrease, our fixed costs are spread over reduced output and, absent other circumstances, our profit margins decrease. Conversely, as factory loadings increase, our fixed costs are spread over increased output and, absent other circumstances, our profit margins increase. Increases and decreases in factory loadings tend to correspond to increases and decreases in demand. • The 2017 enactment of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act) reduces our annual operating tax rate, which does not include discrete tax items, from 31 percent in 2017 to an ongoing rate of about 16 percent starting in 2019. In 2018, our annual operating tax rate was 20 percent, 4 percentage points higher, primarily due to a transitional non-cash expense. For an explanation of the term “annual operating tax rate,” see the Non-GAAP financial information section. • After a sustained period of growth, in late 2018 the semiconductor market entered a downturn. As a result, demand for our products weakened, and we expect this weakness to continue in 2019. During this time, we will continue to be disciplined with our operating plan and expenses, while focusing on long-term investments to strengthen our competitive advantages. • All dollar amounts in the tables are stated in millions of U.S. dollars. Results of operations We continued to perform well in 2018, even as the year ended with a semiconductor market slowdown. We focus on Analog and Embedded Processing, with an emphasis on the industrial and automotive markets, because these products serve highly diverse markets with thousands of applications and have long-term growth opportunities. Gross margin of 65.1 percent reflected the quality of our product portfolio, as well as the efficiency of our manufacturing strategy, including the benefit of 300-millimeter Analog production. Our focus on Analog and Embedded Processing allows us to generate strong cash flow from operations. Our cash flow from operations of $7.19 billion underscored the strength of our business model. Free cash flow was $6.06 billion and represented 38.4 percent of revenue, up from 31.2 percent a year ago. During 2018, we returned $7.66 billion to shareholders through a combination of stock repurchases and dividends. Our strategy is to return all free cash flow to shareholders. Our dividends represented 42 percent of free cash flow, underscoring their sustainability. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure. See the Non-GAAP financial information section. Details of financial results – 2018 compared with 2017 Revenue of $15.78 billion increased $823 million, or 6 percent, primarily due to higher revenue from Analog. Embedded Processing also grew. Gross profit of $10.28 billion was up $663 million, or 7 percent, due to higher revenue and lower manufacturing costs. As a percentage of revenue, gross profit increased to 65.1 percent from 64.3 percent. Operating expenses (R&D and SG&A) were $3.24 billion compared with $3.20 billion. Acquisition charges of $318 million were non-cash. See Note 8 to the financial statements. Operating profit was $6.71 billion, or 42.5 percent of revenue, compared with $6.08 billion, or 40.7 percent of revenue. Other income and expense (OI&E) was $98 million of income compared with $75 million of income. See Note 13 to the financial statements. Interest and debt expense of $125 million increased $47 million due to the issuance of additional long-term debt. Our provision for income taxes was $1.11 billion compared with $2.40 billion, which includes a discrete tax benefit of $198 million in 2018 and a discrete tax expense of $540 million in 2017. The decrease in our tax provision was due to the enactment of the Tax Act in 2017, which included a reduction in the statutory tax rate in 2018 and the tax on indefinitely reinvested earnings recorded in 2017. The benefits of the Tax Act in 2018 were partially offset by higher income before income taxes. Our effective tax rate, which includes discrete tax items, was 17 percent in 2018 compared with 39 percent in 2017. See Note 5 to the financial statements for a reconciliation of the U.S. statutory income tax rate to our effective tax rate. Net income was $5.58 billion compared with $3.68 billion. EPS was $5.59 compared with $3.61. 17 Segment results – 2018 compared with 2017 Analog (includes Power, Signal Chain and High Volume product lines) 2018 2017 Change Revenue $ 10,801 $ 9,900 9 % Operating profit 5,109 4,468 14 % Operating profit % of revenue 47.3 % 45.1 % Analog revenue increased due to Power and, to a lesser extent, Signal Chain, partially offset by a decline in High Volume.

Details of financial results – 2017 compared with 2016 Revenue of $14.96 billion was up $1.59 billion, or 12 percent, from 2016 due to higher revenue from Analog and Embedded Processing. Gross profit of $9.61 billion was up $1.36 billion, or 16 percent, primarily due to higher revenue. As a percentage of revenue, gross profit increased to 64.3 percent from 61.8 percent. Operating expenses were $3.20 billion compared with $3.10 billion, as we allocated resources from manufacturing support and SG&A into R&D activities. Acquisition charges of $318 million were non-cash. Restructuring charges/other was a charge of $11 million compared with a credit of $15 million in 2016. These amounts are included in Other for segment reporting purposes. See Note 12 to the financial statements. Operating profit was $6.08 billion, or 40.7 percent of revenue, compared with $4.86 billion, or 36.3 percent of revenue. OI&E was $75 million of income compared with $155 million of income in 2016. Our provision for income taxes was $2.40 billion compared with $1.34 billion. The increase was due to the enactment of the Tax Act and, to a lesser extent, higher income before income taxes. Our effective tax rate, which includes discrete tax items, was 39 percent in 2017 compared with 27 percent in 2016. Net income was $3.68 billion compared with $3.60 billion. EPS was $3.61 compared with $3.48. 18 Segment results – 2017 compared with 2016 Analog 2017 2016 Change Revenue $ 9,900 $ 8,536 16 % Operating profit 4,468 3,416 31 % Operating profit % of revenue 45.1 % 40.0 % Analog revenue increased due to Power and Signal Chain.

Operating profit decreased by $150 million. Financial condition At the end of 2018, total cash (cash and cash equivalents plus short-term investments) was $4.23 billion, a decrease of $236 million from the end of 2017. Accounts receivable were $1.21 billion, a decrease of $71 million compared with the end of 2017. Days sales outstanding at the end of 2018 were 29 compared with 31 at the end of 2017. Inventory was $2.22 billion, an increase of $260 million from the end of 2017. Days of inventory at the end of 2018 were 152 compared with 134 at the end of 2017. Liquidity and capital resources Our primary source of liquidity is cash flow from operations. Additional sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and a variable rate, revolving credit facility. Cash flows from operating activities for 2018 were $7.19 billion, an increase of $1.83 billion from 2017. This increase was due to higher net income, which benefited from a lower effective tax rate. Our revolving credit facility is with a consortium of investment-grade banks and allows us to borrow up to $2 billion until March 2023. This credit facility also serves as support for the issuance of commercial paper. As of December 31, 2018, our credit facility was undrawn, and we had no commercial paper outstanding. Investing activities for 2018 used $78 million compared with $1.13 billion in 2017. Capital expenditures were $1.13 billion compared with $695 million in 2017 and were primarily for semiconductor manufacturing equipment in both periods. We had sales of short-term investments, net of purchases, that provided cash proceeds of $1.07 billion compared with purchases of short-term investments, net of sales, that used cash of $460 million in 2017. We received $9 million from asset sales compared with $40 million in 2017. 19 Financing activities for 2018 used $6.33 billion compared with $3.73 billion in 2017. In 2018, we received net proceeds of $1.50 billion from the issuance of fixed-rate, long-term debt and retired maturing debt of $500 million. In 2017, we received net proceeds of $1.10 billion from the issuance of fixed-rate, long-term debt and retired maturing debt of $625 million. Dividends paid in 2018 were $2.56 billion compared with $2.10 billion in 2017, reflecting an increase in the dividend rate, partially offset by fewer shares outstanding. We used $5.10 billion to repurchase 49.5 million shares of our common stock compared with $2.56 billion used in 2017 to repurchase 30.6 million shares. Employee exercises of stock options provided cash proceeds of $373 million compared with $483 million in 2017. We had $2.44 billion of cash and cash equivalents and $1.80 billion of short-term investments as of December 31, 2018. We believe we have the necessary financial resources and operating plans to fund our working capital needs, capital expenditures, dividend and debt-related payments, and other business requirements for at least the next 12 months. Non-GAAP financial information This MD&A includes references to free cash flow and ratios based on that measure. These are financial measures that were not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP). Free cash flow was calculated by subtracting capital expenditures from the most directly comparable GAAP measure, cash flows from operating activities (also referred to as cash flow from operations). We believe that free cash flow and the associated ratios provide insight into our liquidity, our cash-generating capability and the amount of cash potentially available to return to shareholders, as well as insight into our financial performance. These non-GAAP measures are supplemental to the comparable GAAP measures. Reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP-based measures is provided in the table below. For Years Ended December 31, 2018 2017 2016 Cash flow from operations (GAAP) $ 7,189 $ 5,363 $ 4,614 Capital expenditures (1,131 ) (695 ) (531 ) Free cash flow (non-GAAP) $ 6,058 $ 4,668 $ 4,083 Revenue $ 15,784 $ 14,961 $ 13,370 Cash flow from operations as a percent of revenue (GAAP) 45.5 % 35.8 % 34.5 % Free cash flow as a percent of revenue (non-GAAP) 38.4 % 31.2 % 30.5 % This MD&A also includes references to an annual operating tax rate, a non-GAAP term we use to describe the estimated annual effective tax rate, a GAAP measure that by definition does not include discrete tax items. We believe the term annual operating tax rate helps differentiate from the effective tax rate, which includes discrete tax items. 20 Long-term contractual obligations Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations 2019 2020/2021 2022/2023 Thereafter Total Long-term debt (a) $ 886 $ 1,281 $ 1,188 $ 3,876 $ 7,231 Purchase commitments (b) 389 469 37 15 910 Tax on indefinitely reinvested earnings (c) — 46 156 304 506 Operating leases (d) 56 82 47 39 224 Deferred compensation plans (e) 17 46 48 111 222 Total (f) $ 1,348 $ 1,924 $ 1,476 $ 4,345 $ 9,093 (a) Principal and related interest payments for our long-term debt obligations, including amounts classified as the current portion of long-term debt. (b) Includes payments for software licenses and contractual arrangements with suppliers when there is a fixed, non-cancellable payment schedule or when minimum payments are due with a reduced delivery schedule. Excludes cancellable arrangements. (c) Future payments for the one-time transition tax on our indefinitely reinvested earnings related to the enactment of the Tax Act. See Note 5 to the financial statements for more details. (d) Includes minimum payments for leased facilities and equipment and purchases of industrial gases under contracts accounted for as operating leases. (e) Estimated payments for certain liabilities that existed as of December 31, 2018. (f) Excludes $286 million of uncertain tax liabilities under ASC 740, as well as any planned future funding contributions to retirement benefit plans. Amounts associated with uncertain tax liabilities have been excluded because of the difficulty in making reasonably reliable estimates of the timing of cash settlements with the respective taxing authorities. Regarding future funding of retirement benefit plans, we plan to contribute about $50 million in 2019, but funding projections beyond 2019 are not practical to estimate due to the rules affecting tax-deductible contributions and the impact from the plans’ asset performance, interest rates and potential U.S. and non-U.S. legislation. Critical accounting policies Our accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements. As disclosed in Note 2, the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. However, based on facts and circumstances inherent in developing estimates and assumptions, management believes it is unlikely that applying other estimates and assumptions would have a material impact on the financial statements. We consider the following accounting policies to be those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and that require a higher degree of judgment. Revenue recognition Based on management’s assessment of the revenue recognition criteria, we usually recognize revenue from sales of our products to distributors upon shipment or delivery to the distributors. For our consignment arrangements with distributors, delivery occurs when the distributor pulls product from consignment inventory that we store at designated locations. Recognition is not contingent upon resale of the products to the distributors’ customers in either scenario. Revenue is recognized net of allowances, which are management’s estimates of future credits to be granted to distributors under programs common in the semiconductor industry. These allowances are not material and generally include special pricing arrangements, product returns due to quality issues, and incentives designed to maximize growth opportunities. Allowances are based on analysis of historical data and contractual terms and are recorded when revenue is recognized. We believe we can reasonably and reliably estimate allowances for credits to distributors in a timely manner. Income taxes In determining net income for financial statement purposes, we must make certain estimates and judgments in the calculation of tax provisions and the resultant tax liabilities, and in the recoverability of deferred tax assets that arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense. 21 In the ordinary course of global business, there may be many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. The calculation of tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. We recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the United States and other tax jurisdictions based on an estimate of the ultimate resolution of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. Although we believe the estimates are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these matters will not be different than what is reflected in the historical income tax provisions and accruals. As part of our financial process, we must assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets can be recovered. If recovery is not likely, the provision for taxes must be increased by recording a reserve in the form of a valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets that are estimated not to be ultimately recoverable. In this process, certain relevant criteria are evaluated including the existence of deferred tax liabilities that can be used to absorb deferred tax assets, the taxable income in prior years that can be used to absorb net operating losses and credit carrybacks, and taxable income in future years. Our judgment regarding future recoverability of our deferred tax assets based on these criteria may change due to various factors, including changes in U.S. or international tax laws and changes in market conditions and their impact on our assessment of taxable income in future periods. These changes, if any, may require material adjustments to the deferred tax assets and an accompanying reduction or increase in net income in the period when such determinations are made. Also, our plans for the permanent reinvestment or eventual repatriation of the accumulated earnings of certain non-U.S. operations could change. Such changes could have a material effect on tax expense in future years. Inventory valuation allowances Inventory is valued net of allowances for unsalable or obsolete raw materials, work-in-process and finished goods. Statistical allowances are determined quarterly for raw materials and work-in-process based on historical disposals of inventory for salability and obsolescence reasons. For finished goods, quarterly statistical allowances are determined by comparing inventory levels of individual parts to historical shipments, current backlog and estimated future sales in order to identify inventory judged unlikely to be sold. A specific allowance for each material type will be carried if there is a significant event not captured by the statistical allowance. Examples are an end-of-life part or demand with imminent risk of cancellation. Allowances are also calculated quarterly for instances where inventoried costs for individual products are in excess of the net realizable value for those products. Actual future write-offs of inventory for salability and obsolescence reasons may differ from estimates and calculations used to determine valuation allowances due to changes in customer demand, customer negotiations, technology shifts and other factors. Changes in accounting standards See Note 2 to the financial statements for information on new accounting standards. Off-balance sheet arrangements As of December 31, 2018, we had no significant off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K. Commitments and contingencies See Note 11 to the financial statements for a discussion of our commitments and contingencies. 22 ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. Foreign exchange risk The U.S. dollar is our functional currency for financial reporting. Our non-U.S. entities own assets or liabilities denominated in U.S. dollars or other currencies. Exchange rate fluctuations impact taxable income in those jurisdictions, and consequently impact our effective tax rate. Our balance sheet also reflects amounts remeasured from non-U.S. dollar currencies. Because most of the aggregate non-U.S. dollar balance sheet exposure is hedged by forward currency exchange contracts, based on year-end 2018 balances and currency exchange rates, a hypothetical 10 percent plus or minus fluctuation in non-U.S. currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar would result in a pre-tax currency exchange gain or loss of about $3 million. We use these forward currency exchange contracts to reduce the earnings impact that exchange rate fluctuations may have on our non-U.S. dollar net balance sheet exposures. For example, at year-end 2018, we had forward currency exchange contracts outstanding with a notional value of $525 million to hedge net balance sheet exposures (including $160 million to sell Japanese yen, $99 million to sell euros and $94 million to sell Indian rupees). Similar hedging activities existed at year-end 2017. Interest rate risk We have the following potential exposure to changes in interest rates: (1) the effect of changes in interest rates on the fair value of our investments in cash equivalents and short-term investments, which could produce a gain or a loss; and (2) the effect of changes in interest rates on the fair value of our debt. As of December 31, 2018, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would decrease the fair value of our investments in cash equivalents and short-term investments by about $4 million and decrease the fair value of our long-term debt by $330 million. Because interest rates on our long-term debt are fixed, changes in interest rates would not affect the cash flows associated with long-term debt. Equity risk Long-term investments at year-end 2018 include the following: • Investments in mutual funds – includes mutual funds that were selected to generate returns that offset changes in certain liabilities related to deferred compensation arrangements. The mutual funds hold a variety of debt and equity investments. • Investments in venture capital funds – includes investments in limited partnerships (accounted for under either the equity method or at cost as non-marketable equity securities). • Equity investments – includes non-marketable (non-publicly traded) equity securities. Investments in mutual funds are stated at fair value. Changes in prices of the mutual fund investments are expected to offset related changes in deferred compensation liabilities such that a 10 percent increase or decrease in the investments’ fair values would not materially affect operating results. Non-marketable equity securities and certain venture capital funds are stated at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from qualifying observable price changes. Investments in the remaining venture capital funds are stated using the equity method. See Note 7 to the financial statements for details of equity and other long-term investments. 23",2023-12-30 17:49:11.649760
