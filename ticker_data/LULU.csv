1397187,LULU,lululemon athletica inc.,2008,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the “Selected Consolidated Financial Data” section and our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition, this discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements based on current expectations that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions, such as our plans, objectives, expectations and intentions set forth in the “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.” Our actual results and the timing of events may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth in the “Item 1A — Risk Factors” section and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Certain tables may not sum due to rounding. Overview We believe lululemon is one of the fastest growing designers and retailers of technical athletic apparel in North America. Our yoga-inspired apparel is marketed under the lululemon athletica brand name. We offer a comprehensive line of apparel and accessories including fitness pants, shorts, tops and jackets designed for athletic pursuits such as yoga, dance, running and general fitness. As of February 3, 2008, our branded apparel was principally sold through 81 corporate-owned and franchise stores that are primarily located in Canada and the United States. We believe our vertical retail strategy allows us to interact more directly with and gain insights from our customers while providing us with greater control of our brand. In fiscal 2006, 87.1% of our net revenue was derived from sales of our products in Canada, 11.7% of our net revenue was derived from the sales of our products in the United States and 1.2% of our net revenue was derived from sales of our products in Australia and Japan. In fiscal 2007, 79.5% of our net revenue was derived from sales of our products in Canada, 19.4% of our net revenue was derived from the sales of our products in the United States and 1.1% of our net revenue was derived from sales of our products in Australia and Japan. For fiscal years through fiscal 2006, our fiscal year ended on January 31st in the year following the year mentioned. Commencing with fiscal 2007, our fiscal year will end on the first Sunday following January 30th in the year following the year mentioned. Our net revenue has grown from $40.7 million in fiscal 2004 to $274.7 million in fiscal 2007. This represents a compound annual growth rate of 88.9%. Our net revenue also increased from $148.9 million in fiscal 2006 to $274.7 million in fiscal 2007, representing an 84.5% increase. Our increase in net revenue from fiscal 2004 to fiscal 2007 resulted from the addition of 17 retail locations in fiscal 2005, 14 retail locations in fiscal 2006 and 31 retail locations in fiscal 2007, and strong comparable store sales growth of 19%, 25% and 34% in fiscal 2005, fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2007, respectively. Our ability to open new stores and grow sales in existing stores has been driven by increasing demand for our technical athletic apparel and a growing recognition of the lululemon athletica brand. We believe our superior products, strategic store locations, inviting store environment, grassroots marketing approach and distinctive corporate culture are responsible for our strong financial performance. We have recently increased our focus on our men’s apparel line, which increased 69% in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 and represented approximately 11% of net revenue in fiscal 2006 and 10% of net revenue in fiscal 2007, and our accessories business, which represented approximately 9% and 10% of net revenue for each of fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2007, respectively. The two most important drivers of our future net revenue, earnings and cash flow growth are the successful expansion of our corporate-owned store base and increases in comparable store sales. Though we expect continued growth in net revenues, we expect our growth rate to decline in the future relative to the rate of growth we have experienced in historical periods as incremental revenue is measured against a larger revenue base. Moreover, we expect a significant portion of our new store growth to be concentrated in the United States. Future comparable store sales growth will depend on our ability to continue to attract and retain motivated corporate- and store-level employees that are passionate about the lululemon athletica vision. Other external factors that could affect our net revenue, earnings and cash flows include fluctuations in currency exchange rates and general economic conditions in our target markets. 29 Table of Contents lululemon was founded in 1998 by Dennis “Chip” Wilson in Vancouver, Canada. We initially conducted our operations through our Canadian operating company, lululemon athletica canada inc. In 2002, in connection with our expansion into the United States, we formed a sibling operating company to conduct our U.S. operations, lululemon usa inc. Both operating companies were wholly-owned by affiliates of Mr. Wilson. In December 2005, Mr. Wilson sold 48% of his interest in lululemon to a group of private equity investors led by Advent International Corporation and Highland Capital Partners. Prior to this time, Mr. Wilson was our sole stockholder. Pursuant to the terms of the December 2005 transaction, we formed lululemon athletica inc. (formerly known as Lululemon Corp. and before that as Lulu Holding, Inc.) to serve as a holding company for all of our related entities, including our two primary operating companies lululemon usa inc. and lululemon athletica canada inc. We completed the initial public offering of our common stock on July 26, 2007. We have three reportable segments: corporate-owned stores, franchises and other. We report our segments based on the financial information we use in managing our businesses. While we receive financial information for each corporate-owned store, we have aggregated all of the corporate-owned stores into one reportable segment due to the similarities in the economic and other characteristics of these stores. Our franchises segment accounted for 17.3% of our net revenues in fiscal 2005, 14.3% in fiscal 2006 and 6.6% in fiscal 2007. Opening new franchise stores is not a significant part of our near-term growth strategy, and we therefore expect that if the revenue derived from our franchise stores continues to comprise less than 10% of the net revenue we report in future fiscal years, we will re-evaluate our segment reporting disclosures. Our other operations accounted for less than 10% of our revenues in each of fiscal 2005, fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2007. As of February 3, 2008, we sold our products through 71 corporate-owned stores located in Canada, the United States and Japan. Most of our corporate-owned stores are located in North America, with only four corporate-owned stores located in Japan. As previously disclosed, we plan to discontinue our operations in Japan. We plan to increase our net revenue in North America by opening additional corporate-owned stores in new and existing markets. Corporate-owned stores net revenue accounted for 81.1% of total net revenue in fiscal 2006 and 88.7% of total net revenue in fiscal 2007. As of February 3, 2008, we also had seven franchise stores located in North America and three franchise stores located in Australia. In the past, we have entered into franchise agreements to distribute lululemon athletica branded products to more quickly disseminate our brand name and increase our net revenue and net income. In exchange for the use of our brand name and the ability to operate lululemon athletica stores in certain regions, our franchisees generally pay us a one-time franchise fee and ongoing royalties based on their gross revenue. Additionally, unless otherwise approved by us, our franchisees are required to sell only lululemon athletica branded products, which are purchased from us at a discount to the suggested retail price. Pursuing new franchise partnerships or opening new franchise stores is not a significant part of our near-term store growth strategy. In some cases, we may exercise our contractual rights to purchase franchises where it is attractive to us. Franchises net revenue accounted for 14.3% of total net revenue in fiscal 2006 and 6.6% of total net revenue in fiscal 2007. We believe that our athletic apparel has and will continue to appeal to consumers outside of North America who value its technical attributes as well as its function and style. In 2004, we opened our first franchise store in Australia. In the third quarter of fiscal 2007, we opened our second franchise store in Australia, and in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 we opened our third franchise store in Australia. We intend to convert the Australian franchise operations into a joint venture partnership. In 2005, we opened a franchise store in Japan. In 2006, we terminated our franchise arrangement and entered into a joint venture agreement with Descente Ltd, or Descente, a global leader in fabric technology, to operate our stores in Japan. This joint venture company is named Lululemon Japan Inc. As of February 3, 2008, we operated four stores through Lululemon Japan Inc. that we plan to close. In addition to deriving revenue from sales through our corporate-owned stores and our franchises, we also derive other net revenue, which includes the sale of our products directly to wholesale customers, telephone sales to retail customers, including related shipping and handling charges, warehouse sales and sales through a limited number of company-operated showrooms. Wholesale customers include select premium yoga studios, health clubs and fitness centers. Telephone sales are taken directly from retail customers through our call center. Warehouse sales are typically held one or more times a year to sell slow moving inventory or inventory from prior seasons to retail customers at discounted prices. Our showrooms are typically small locations that we open from time to time 30 Table of Contents when we enter new markets and feature a limited selection of our product offering during select hours. Other net revenue accounted for 4.6% of total net revenue in fiscal 2006 and 4.7% of total net revenue in fiscal 2007. We believe that a number of trends relevant to our industry have affected our results and may continue to do so. Specifically, we believe that there is an increasing appreciation for the health benefits of yoga and related fitness activities in our markets and that women, our primary customers, are increasingly embracing an active healthy lifestyle. As such, we believe that participation in yoga and related fitness activities will continue to grow. There is also an increasing demand for technical athletic apparel relative to traditional athletic apparel, and we believe that more people are wearing technical apparel in casual environments to create a healthy lifestyle perception. The duration and extent of these trends, however, is unknown, and adverse changes in these trends may negatively impact our net revenue, earnings or cash flows. Basis of Presentation Net revenue is comprised of: • corporate-owned store net revenue, which includes sales to customers through corporate-owned stores (including stores operated by our majority-owned joint venture); • franchises net revenue, which consists of licensing fees and royalties as well as sales of our products to franchises; and • other net revenue, which includes sales to wholesale accounts, telephone sales, including related shipping and handling charges, warehouse sales and sales from company-operated showrooms; in each case, less returns and discounts. Comparable store sales reflects net revenue at corporate-owned stores that have been open for at least 12 months. Therefore, net revenue from a store is included in comparable store sales beginning with the first month for which the store has a full month of comparable prior year sales. Comparable store sales includes stores that have been remodeled or relocated and stores operated by our majority-owned joint venture. Non-comparable store sales include sales from new stores that have not been open for 12 months, sales from showrooms, and sales from stores that were closed within the past 12 months. By measuring the change in year-over-year net revenue in stores that have been open for 12 months or more, comparable store sales allows us to evaluate how our core store base is performing. Various factors affect comparable store sales, including: • the location of new stores relative to existing stores; • consumer preferences, buying trends and overall economic trends; • our ability to anticipate and respond effectively to customer preferences for technical athletic apparel; • competition; • changes in our merchandise mix; • pricing; • the timing of our releases of new merchandise and promotional events; • the effectiveness of our grassroots marketing efforts; • the level of customer service that we provide in our stores; • our ability to source and distribute products efficiently; and • the number of stores we open, close (including for temporary renovations) and expand in any period. As we continue our store expansion program, we expect that a greater percentage of our net revenue will come from non-comparable store sales. Opening new stores is an important part of our growth strategy. Accordingly, 31 Table of Contents comparable store sales has limited utility for assessing the success of our growth strategy insofar as comparable store sales do not reflect the performance of stores open less than 12 months. Cost of goods sold includes: • the cost of purchased merchandise, inbound freight, duty and non-refundable taxes incurred in delivering goods to our distribution centers; • the cost of our production, merchandise and design departments including salaries, stock-based compensation and benefits, and operating expenses; • the cost of occupancy related to store operations (such as rent and utilities) and the depreciation and amortization related to store-level capital expenditures; • the cost of our distribution centers (such as rent and utilities) as well as other fees we pay to third parties to operate our distribution centers and the depreciation and amortization related to our distribution centers; • the cost of outbound freight and handling costs incurred upon shipment of merchandise; and • shrink and valuation reserves. Cost of goods sold also may change as we open or close stores because of the resulting change in related occupancy costs. The primary drivers of the costs of individual goods are the costs of raw materials and labor in the countries where we source our merchandise. In fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2007, cost of goods sold included $0.4 million and $0.7 million, respectively, of charges related to stock-based compensation. We anticipate that our cost of goods sold will increase in absolute dollars but will remain relatively stable as a percentage of net revenue. Our selling, general and administrative expenses consist of all operating costs not otherwise included in cost of goods sold, principal stockholder bonus or settlement of lawsuit. Our selling, general and administrative expenses include marketing costs, accounting costs, information technology costs, professional fees, corporate facility costs, corporate and store-level payroll and benefits expenses including stock-based compensation (other than the salaries and benefits and stock-based compensation for our production, merchandise and design departments included in cost of goods sold and other corporate costs). In fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2007, selling, general and administrative expenses included $2.6 million and $5.2 million, respectively, of charges related to stock-based compensation. Our selling, general and administrative expenses also include depreciation and amortization expense for all assets other than depreciation and amortization expenses related to store-level capital expenditures and our distribution centers, each of which are included in cost of goods sold. We anticipate that our selling, general and administrative expenses for will increase in absolute dollars due to anticipated continued growth of our corporate support staff and store-level employees. Principal stockholder bonus consists of annual bonus payments paid to Mr. Wilson prior to December 2005. These bonuses were paid to Mr. Wilson as our sole stockholder and were in an amount equal to our Canadian taxable income for the year above a particular threshold. For Canadian income tax purposes, these payments were fully taxable to Mr. Wilson as ordinary income and fully deductible by us as a compensation expense. Following his sale of 48% of his interest in lululemon to a group of private equity investors in December 2005, these payments to Mr. Wilson were discontinued. Settlement of lawsuit consists of a payment we made in February 2007 in the amount of $7.2 million to a third party website developer arising from the termination of a profit sharing arrangement associated with our retail website for our products. We accrued for the entire settlement amount in fiscal 2006. Stock-based compensation expense includes charges incurred in recognition of compensation expense associated with grants of stock options, grants of restricted stock units, and stock purchases. In December 2005, we adopted the fair value recognition and measurement provisions of SFAS No. 123(R), Share-Based Payment (SFAS 123(R)). SFAS 123(R) is applicable to stock-based awards exchanged for employee services and in certain circumstances for non-employee directors. We recognize stock-based compensation expense for both awards granted by us and awards granted under a stockholder sponsored plan. Pursuant to SFAS 123(R), stock-based compensation expense is measured at the grant date, based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as an expense over the requisite service period. 32 Table of Contents Prior to our initial public offering in July 2007, the fair value of the shares of common stock that underlie the stock options we granted was determined by our board of directors. Our board of directors determined a valuation of lululemon as of April 30, 2006. The valuation was calculated based upon the equity value implied by the December 2005 transaction in which Mr. Wilson sold 48% of his interest in lululemon to a group of private equity investors for approximately $193.3 million. At the time, our board of directors believed the December 2005 transaction was a valid indication of fair value because the terms of the December 2005 transaction were the result of arms-length negotiations among independent parties. Because there had been no public market for our common stock, our board used this valuation to determine the fair value of our common stock at the time of grant of the options. In connection with the preparation of the financial statements necessary for our initial public offering and based in part on discussions with prospective underwriters for the planned offering, in March 2007 we reassessed the estimated accounting fair value as of January 2007 of common stock in light of the potential completion of the initial public offering. After reviewing its valuation, our board of directors determined that the valuation would not be appropriate for valuing the options as the valuation did not fully consider requirements under SFAS 123(R) and other relevant regulatory guidelines, specifically: • the valuation did not coincide with the option grant dates; and • the valuation incorrectly included a minority interest discount. As a result, management determined that it would be necessary to retrospectively calculate a new valuation for the July 2006 option grants. For determining the value of the July 2006 option grants, our board of directors prepared a valuation based upon our sales and earnings multiples implied by the December 2005 transaction. In determining the reassessed fair value of the common stock, we determined it appropriate to consider operational achievements in executing against the operating plan and market trends. Because of the impact the achievement of unique milestones had on the valuation during the various points in time before the reassessment, certain additional adjustments for factors unique to us were considered in the reassessed values determined for the July 2006 option grants, which impacted valuations throughout these periods. These included the following: • in July 2006, management and our board of directors did not believe an initial public offering was possible in the near future because the board of directors was still in the process of augmenting the management team and enhancing infrastructure related to expanding our operations into the United States; • in July 2006, we had only seven stores in the United States, four of which were located in California, and, because of our limited experience outside of Canada, there was still uncertainty that our stores would be successful in the United States and that management would be able to identify suitable markets and retail sites; and • throughout 2006, we were in the process of identifying suitable off-shore manufacturers with the necessary quality standards and capacity to satisfy our current and future manufacturing needs; this process involved meaningful risk requiring significant management focus and attention as well as additional management resources. During this process, management also determined that it would be necessary to retrospectively calculate a new valuation for the December 2006 and January 2007 option grants. Due to the proximity of the December 2006 and January 2007 option grants to a potential initial public offering, our board of directors determined that it was necessary to use a different valuation methodology for these grants. Our board of directors believed then that an initial public offering could be completed as soon as April 30, 2007 and that a forward-looking valuation based on our projected sales and earnings potential was appropriate. The decision to apply forward-looking valuation metrics was based in part on discussions with potential underwriters, and our board of directors’ understanding that the public markets generally use a forward-looking valuation. From the date of the January 2007 stock option grants to the date of our initial public offering in July 2007, we continued to experience increased growth and improved performance. Our board of directors believed that the 33 Table of Contents valuation implied by our then-estimated initial public offering share price was greater than the December 2006 and January 2007 grants as a result of these and the factors set forth below. Such factors included: • in the third and fourth quarter of 2006, we appointed both a Chief Financial Officer and a Chief Operating Officer with past public company roles in similar capacities; • net revenue growth in fiscal 2006 was 77%, to $148.9 million, compared to net revenue in fiscal 2005 of $84.1 million; • net revenue, income from operations and net income for the first quarter of fiscal 2007 increased 58.9%, 12.0%, and 11.3%, respectively, from the first quarter of fiscal 2006, outperforming management’s internal estimates; • favorable exchange rate movement between the U.S. dollar and the Canadian dollar in the first five-and-a-half months of fiscal 2007, which was anticipated to have a positive impact on income from operations in fiscal 2007; • the positive performance of the U.S. equity markets and continued strong equity valuations for high growth companies during such portion of fiscal 2007; and • from February 1, 2007 to the date of our initial public offering, we opened 11 new stores. Based upon the reassessment, we determined that the accounting fair value of the options granted to employees from February 1, 2006 to January 31, 2007 was greater than the exercise price for certain of those options. The comparison of the originally determined fair value and reassessed fair value is as follows for all dates on which an option was granted, assuming that our corporate reorganization had occurred and using the initial public offering price of $18.00 per share: Initial Original Number of Public Fair Value Reassessed Options Exercise Offering Assessment Fair Value Grant Date Granted Price Price of Options of Options July 3, 2006 2,899,186 $ 0.58 $ 18.00 $ 0.33 $ 0.91 December 6, 2006 5,955 $ 0.58 $ 18.00 $ 0.33 $ 8.09 December 27, 2006 1,309,008 $ 0.58 $ 18.00 $ 0.33 $ 8.09 January 3, 2007 357,335 $ 0.58 $ 18.00 $ 0.33 $ 8.09 Based upon the reassessment discussed above, we determined the reassessed accounting fair value of the options to purchase 4,571,484 shares of common stock granted to employees during the period from February 1, 2006 to January 31, 2007 ranged from $0.91 to $8.09 per share. As a result of the reassessed fair value of our grants of stock options, the aggregate fair value of our stock options increased by $14.6 million. Stock-based compensation expense for the year ended January 31, 2007 includes the difference between the reassessed accounting fair value per share of the common stock on the date of grant and the exercise price per share and is amortized over the vesting period of the underlying options using the straight-line method. There are significant judgments and estimates inherent in the determination of the reassessed accounting fair values. For this and other reasons, the reassessed accounting fair value used to compute the stock-based compensation expense may not be reflective of the fair market value that would result from the application of other valuation methods, including accepted valuation methods for tax purposes. We record our stock-based compensation expense in cost of goods sold and selling, general and administrative expenses as stock-based awards have been made to employees whose salaries are classified in both expense categories. As of February 3, 2008, we had options to purchase 4,772,349 shares of our common stock outstanding with a weighted-average exercise price of $2.74 per share, 745,985 of which were exercisable as of February 3, 2008. As of February 3, 2008, we had 10,458 shares or restricted stock outstanding, none of which had vested as of February 3, 2008. Additionally, prior to our initial public offering, each of LIPO Investments (USA) Inc., or LIPO USA, and LIPO Investments (Canada) Inc., or LIPO Canada, had granted to some of our employees restricted stock of those entities and options to purchase shares of stock in those entities. LIPO USA and LIPO Canada, the sole assets of which were, at the time of our initial public offering, a 52% interest in lululemon, were entities controlled by Mr. Wilson. As part of our corporate reorganization, LIPO Canada became a wholly-owned subsidiary 34 Table of Contents of Lulu Canadian Holding, Inc. and subsequently amalgamated (i.e., merged) with Lulu Canadian Holding, Inc. to become one entity. LIPO USA continues to be controlled by Mr. Wilson. Accordingly, we recognize a stock-based compensation expense for the restricted stock and options granted by those entities. As of February 3, 2008, pursuant to SFAS 123(R), there was $18.4 million of total unrecognized stock-based compensation expense, of which we expect to amortize $7.3 million in fiscal 2008 and the remainder thereafter. Interest income includes interest earned on our cash balances. We expect to continue to generate interest income to the extent that our cash generated from operations exceeds our cash used for investment. Interest expense includes interest costs associated with our credit facilities and with letters of credit drawn under these facilities for the purchase of merchandise. We have maintained relatively small outstanding balances on our credit facilities and expect to continue to do so. Provision for income tax depends on the statutory tax rates in the countries where we sell our products. Historically we have generated taxable income in Canada and we have generated tax losses in the United States. As of February 3, 2008, we had $2.8 million of federal net operating loss carryforwards available to reduce future taxable income in the United States. These tax operating loss carryforwards begin to expire in 2023. These annual limitations may result in the expiration of net operating loss carryforwards before they may be used. For the period up to and including the second quarter of fiscal 2007, we recorded a full valuation allowance against our losses in the United States. In the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2007, we earned taxable income in the United States. However, we continue to record a full valuation allowance against our losses and other tax assets in the United States due to uncertainties surrounding our ability to generate future taxable income to realize these assets. Several factors have contributed to our effective tax rate in recent periods being significantly higher than our anticipated long-term effective tax rate. First, in fiscal 2005, fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2007, we generated losses in the United States which we were unable to offset against our income in Canada for tax purposes. Second, in fiscal 2005, fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2007 we incurred stock-based compensation expense of $2.7 million, $2.8 million and $5.9 million, respectively, a potion of which were not deductible for tax purposes in Canada and the United States during these periods. The impact of these losses and non-deductible expenses on our effective tax rate was exacerbated in fiscal 2005 by the payment of a bonus to our principal stockholder in that period. Prior to December 2005 our sole stockholder, Mr. Wilson, received a bonus payout each year representing a substantial percentage of our earnings before income taxes. Following Mr. Wilson’s sale of 48% of his interest in lululemon to a group of private equity investors in December 2005 we discontinued this practice. Payments of these bonuses therefore were eliminated in fiscal 2006 from $12.8 million in fiscal 2005. This payment in fiscal 2005 significantly decreased our income before income taxes in this period and accordingly resulted in us realizing a higher effective tax rate in this period as we gave effect to the non-deductible nature of the losses and the stock-based compensation expenses. Our effective tax rate in fiscal 2007 was 40.2%, compared to 53.7% in fiscal 2006 and 62.6% in fiscal 2005. In addition, we anticipate that in the future we may start to sell our products directly to some customers located outside of Canada, the United States and Japan, in which case we would become subject to taxation based on the foreign statutory rates in the countries where these sales take place and our effective tax rate could fluctuate accordingly. Internal Controls The process of improving our internal controls has required and will continue to require us to expend significant resources to design, implement and maintain a system of internal controls that is adequate to satisfy our reporting obligations as a public company. There can be no assurance that any actions we take will be completely successful. We will continue to evaluate the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting on an on-going basis. We have begun to document our internal control procedures in order to comply with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Section 404 requires annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and a report by our independent auditors relating to our internal control over financial reporting. We must comply with Section 404 no later than the time we file our annual 35 Table of Contents report for fiscal 2008 with the SEC. As part of this process, we may identify specific internal controls as being deficient. We anticipate retaining additional personnel to assist us in complying with our Section 404 obligations. Results of Operations The following tables summarize key components of our results of operations for the periods indicated, both in dollars and as a percentage of net revenue: Fiscal Year Ended January 31, January 31, February 3, 2006 2007 2008 (In thousands) Consolidated statements of income: Net revenue $ 84,129 $ 148,885 $ 274,713 Cost of goods sold 41,177 72,903 128,411 Gross profit 42,952 75,982 146,302 Operating expenses: Selling, general and administrative expenses 26,416 52,541 96,177 Principal stockholder bonus 12,809 — — Settlement of lawsuit — 7,228 — Income from operations 3,727 16,213 50,125 Interest expense (income), net (3 ) (94 ) (854 ) Income before income tax 3,730 16,307 50,979 Provision for income tax 2,336 8,753 20,471 Non-controlling interest — (112 ) (334 ) Net income $ 1,394 $ 7,666 $ 30,842 Fiscal Year Ended January 31, January 31, February 3, 2006 2007 2008 (% of net revenue) Net revenue 100.0 100.0 100.0 Cost of goods sold 48.9 49.0 46.7 Gross profit 51.1 51.0 53.3 Operating expenses: Selling, general and administrative expenses 31.4 35.3 35.0 Principal stockholder bonus 15.2 — — Settlement of lawsuit — 4.9 — Income from operations 4.4 10.9 18.3 Interest expense (income), net (0.0 ) (0.1 ) (0.3 ) Income before income tax 4.4 11.0 18.6 Provision for income tax 2.8 5.9 7.5 Non-controlling interest — (0.1 ) (0.1 ) Net income 1.7 5.1 11.2 36 Table of Contents Comparison of Fiscal 2007 to Fiscal 2006 Net Revenue Net revenue increased $125.8 million, or 84.5%, to $274.7 million in fiscal 2007 from $148.9 million in fiscal 2006. This increase was primarily the result of increased comparable store sales, sales from new stores opened, and the strengthening of the average exchange rate for the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar during the period. Assuming the average exchange rate between the Canadian and United States dollars in fiscal 2006 remained constant, our net revenue would have increased $108.2 million, or 72.7%, in fiscal 2007. Fiscal Year Ended January 31, February 3, 2007 2008 (In thousands) Net revenue by segment: Corporate-owned stores $ 120,733 $ 243,560 Franchises 21,360 18,141 Other 6,792 13,012 Total net revenue $ 148,885 $ 274,713 Corporate-Owned Stores. Net revenue from our corporate-owned stores segment increased $122.8 million, or 101.7%, to $243.6 million in fiscal 2007 from $120.7 million in fiscal 2006. The following contributed to the $122.8 million increase in net revenue from our corporate-owned stores segment: • Comparable store sales growth of 34% in fiscal 2007 contributed $39.6 million, or 32.2%, of the increase. Assuming the average exchange rate between the Canadian and U.S. dollar in fiscal 2006 remained constant, our comparable store sales would have increased 24% in fiscal 2007 and contributed $28.6 million, or 23.3%, of the increase. The increase in comparable store sales was driven primarily by the strength of our existing product lines, successful introduction of new products and increasing recognition of the lululemon athletica brand name. • New stores opened during fiscal 2007 contributed $29.8 million, or 24.3%, of the increase. During fiscal 2007, we opened 28 corporate-owned stores, consisting of five in Canada, 21 in the United States, and two in Japan. • New stores opened during fiscal 2006 prior to sales from such stores becoming part of our comparable store sales base contributed $28.1 million, or 22.9%, of the increase. This consisted of seven stores in Canada, five stores in the United States and two stores in Japan. • The acquisition of three Calgary franchise stores in April 2007 contributed $22.8 million, or 18.6%, of the increase. • The inclusion of three additional days in our fiscal year in order to align our year-end to a 52/53 week fiscal year contributed an additional $2.5 million. Franchises. Net revenue from our franchises segment decreased $3.3 million, or 15.1%, to $18.1 million in fiscal 2007 from $21.4 million in fiscal 2006. The decrease in net revenue from our franchises segment consisted primarily of franchises net revenue of $9.7 million that shifted to corporate-owned stores net revenue when we acquired three franchise stores in Calgary. This was partially offset by increased franchise revenue of $6.5 million from our remaining franchise locations and one new franchise location in the United States and one new location in Australia. Other. Net revenue from our other segment increased $6.2 million, or 91.6%, to $13.0 million in fiscal 2007 from $6.8 million in fiscal 2006. The following contributed to the $6.2 million increase in net revenue from our other segment: • warehouse sales revenue increased $2.2 million; • new and existing wholesale accounts contributed $1.7 million of the increase; 37 Table of Contents • showroom sales revenue increased $1.7 million; and • phone sale revenue accounted for $0.6 million of the increase. Gross Profit Gross profit increased $70.3 million, or 92.5%, to $146.3 million in fiscal 2007 from $76.0 million in fiscal 2006. The increase in gross profit was driven principally by: • an increase of $122.8 million in net revenue from our corporate-owned stores segment; and • an increase of $6.2 million in net revenue from our other segment. This amount was partially offset by: • an increase in product costs of $38.9 million associated with our sale of goods through corporate-owned stores, franchises and other segments; • an increase in occupancy costs of $8.0 million related to an increase in corporate-owned stores; • an increase of $3.4 million in expenses related to our production, design and merchandising departments; • an increase in depreciation of $3.2 million primarily related to an increase in the number of corporate-owned stores; • a decrease in franchise revenue of $3.2 million related to our acquisition of three franchise locations in Calgary; • a net decrease in the raw materials provision of $0.7 million and an increase of $0.2 million in finished goods provision recorded in current period from the comparative period; and • an increase of $2.2 million in expenses related to distribution costs as a result of increased production to support our growth. Gross profit as a percentage of net revenue, or gross margin, increased 2.3%, to 53.3% in fiscal 2007 from 51.0% in fiscal 2006. The increase in gross margin resulted from: • a reduction in product costs as a percentage of net revenue that contributed to an increase in gross margin of 1.9%, primarily related to our acquisition of three franchise stores in Calgary; • a decrease in expenses related to our production, design and distribution departments (including stock-based compensation expense) as a percentage of net revenue in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006, which contributed to an increase in gross margin of 0.4%; and • a decrease in occupancy costs as a percentage of net revenue that contributed to an increase in gross margin of 0.1%. This amount was partially offset by an increase in store depreciation expense as a percentage of net revenue in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 as a result of new store openings in new markets, which contributed to a decrease in gross margin of 0.2%. Our costs of goods sold in fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006 included $0.7 million and $0.4 million, respectively, of stock-based compensation expense. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $43.6 million, or 83.1%, to $96.2 million in fiscal 2007 from $52.5 million in fiscal 2006. As a percentage of net revenue, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 0.3%, to 35.0%, in 2007 from 35.3% in 2006. Of the $43.6 million increase in selling, general and administrative expenses: • $17.1 million resulted from an increase in store employee compensation related to opening additional corporate-owned stores; 38 Table of Contents • $8.1 million resulted from an increase in corporate compensation principally due to hiring of additional employees to support our growth; • $10.5 million resulted from an increase in other store operating expenses primarily related to an increase of $4.0 million in distribution costs, $1.6 million in credit card fees, $1.3 million in supplies, $1.2 million in packaging costs, $0.9 million in marketing costs, $0.6 million in repairs and maintenance, $0.3 million in communications costs, $0.2 million in meals and entertainment, $0.1 million in insurance costs, and $0.1 million in professional fees; • $5.5 million resulted from an increase in other corporate expenses such as travel expenses and rent associated with corporate facilities; • $2.9 million resulted from an increase in stock-based compensation expense; and • a foreign exchange loss of $0.7 million. This amount was partially offset by a decrease in professional fees of $1.1 million. Our selling, general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006 included $5.2 million and $2.5 million, respectively, of stock-based compensation expense. Income from Operations Income from operations increased $33.9 million, or 209.2%, to $50.1 million in 2007 from $16.2 million in 2006. The increase of $33.9 million in income from operations for fiscal 2007 was primarily due to a $70.3 million increase in gross profit resulting from increased comparable store sales and additional sales from corporate-owned stores opened during fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2007, partially offset by an increase of $43.6 million in selling, general and administrative expenses and the settlement of a lawsuit in fiscal 2006 of $7.2 million. On a segment basis, we determine income from operations without taking into account our general corporate expenses such as corporate employee costs, travel expenses and corporate rent. For purposes of our management’s analysis of our financial results, we have allocated some general product expenses to our corporate-owned stores segment. For example, all expenses related to our production, design, merchandise and distribution departments have been allocated to this segment. Income from operations (before general corporate expenses) from: • our corporate-owned stores segment increased $41.3 million, or 109.3%, to $79.1 million for fiscal 2007 from $37.8 million for fiscal 2006 primarily due to an increase in corporate-owned stores gross profit of $69.0 million, offset by an increase of $17.1 million in store employee expenses and an increase of $10.6 million in other store expenses; • our franchises segment decreased $1.9 million, or 17.8%, to $8.8 million in fiscal 2007 from $10.7 million in fiscal 2006 primarily as a result of franchises income from operations of $4.5 million included in the comparative period shifting to corporate-owned stores income from operations when we acquired three franchise stores in Calgary, partially offset by increased franchise income from operations of $2.6 million from our remaining franchise locations; and • our other segment increased $3.3 million, or 118.1%, to $6.0 million in fiscal 2007 from $2.7 million in fiscal 2006 primarily due to an increase in revenue of $6.2 million, offset by an increase of $3.0 million in product costs. Income from operations also includes general corporate expenses. General corporate expenses increased $13.0 million, or 52.3%, to $37.9 million in fiscal 2007 from $24.9 million in fiscal 2006 primarily due to an increase in corporate employee costs of $8.1 million, an increase in depreciation and amortization expense of $0.6 million, and an increase in other corporate expenses of $5.5 million, partially offset by a $1.1 million decrease in professional fees. 39 Table of Contents Interest Income Interest income increased $0.9 million, to $1.0 million in fiscal 2007 from $0.1 million in fiscal 2006 due to higher average cash balances. Interest Expense Interest expense increased $0.2 million, to $0.2 million in fiscal 2007 from nil in fiscal 2006 due to higher average borrowings on our line of credit. Provision for Income Taxes Provision for income taxes increased $11.7 million, to $20.5 million in fiscal 2007 from $8.8 million in fiscal 2006. In fiscal 2007, our effective tax rate was 40.2% compared to 53.7% in fiscal 2006. In both fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2007, we generated losses in the United States which we were unable to offset against our income in Canada for tax purposes. In fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2007, we also incurred stock-based compensation expenses of $2.6 million and $5.9 million, respectively, a portion of which were not deductible for tax purposes during these periods. Net Income Net income increased $23.2 million, to $30.8 million in fiscal 2007 from $7.7 million in fiscal 2006. The increase in net income of $23.2 million in fiscal 2007 was a result of an increase in gross profit of $70.3 million resulting from increased comparable store sales, additional sales from corporate-owned stores opened and the strengthening of the average rate for the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar during the period, offset by increases in selling, general and administrative expenses of $43.6 million and an increase of $11.7 million in provision for income taxes. Comparison of Fiscal 2006 to Fiscal 2005 Net Revenue Net revenue increased $64.8 million, or 77.0%, to $148.9 million in fiscal 2006 from $84.1 million in fiscal 2005. This increase was the result of increased comparable store sales, sales from new stores opened in fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2006, higher franchises net revenues and the strengthening of the average exchange rate for the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar during the year. Assuming the average exchange rate between the Canadian and U.S. dollar in fiscal 2005 remained constant, our net revenue would have increased $58.1 million, or 69.0%, in fiscal 2006. Fiscal Year Ended January 31, January 31, 2006 2007 (In thousands) Net revenue by segment: Corporate-owned stores $ 65,577 $ 120,733 Franchises 14,555 21,360 Other 3,997 6,792 Total net revenue $ 84,129 $ 148,885 Corporate-Owned Stores. Net revenue from our corporate-owned stores segment increased $55.2 million, or 84.1%, to $120.7 million in fiscal 2006 from $65.6 million in fiscal 2005. The following contributed to the $55.2 million increase in net revenue from our corporate-owned stores segment: • New stores opened during fiscal 2005 prior to sales from such stores becoming part of our comparable store sales base contributed $22.2 million, or 40.3%, of the increase. During fiscal 2005, we opened 13 corporate-owned stores, consisting of 12 in Canada and one in the United States. 40 Table of Contents • New stores opened during fiscal 2006 contributed $16.7 million, or 30.3%, of the increase. During fiscal 2006, we opened 13 corporate-owned stores, consisting of seven in Canada, five in the United States and one in Japan. • Comparable store sales in fiscal 2006 contributed $16.2 million, or 29.4%, of the increase. Assuming the average exchange rate between the Canadian and the U.S. dollar in fiscal 2005 remained constant, our comparable store sales would have increased $12.8 million or 20% in fiscal 2006. The increase in comparable store sales on a constant currency basis was driven primarily by the strength of our existing product lines, successful introduction of new products and increasing recognition of the lululemon athletica brand name. Franchises. Net revenue from our franchises segment increased $6.8 million, or 46.8%, to $21.4 million in fiscal 2006 from $14.6 million in fiscal 2005. Of the $6.8 million increase in net revenue from our franchises segment, $4.4 million, or 64.1%, of the increase resulted from sales of goods to franchise stores and $2.4 million, or 35.9%, of the increase resulted from an increase in royalty revenue. During fiscal 2006, two franchise stores were opened and two franchise stores were converted to corporate-owned stores. Other. Net revenue from our other segment increased $2.8 million, or 69.9%, to $6.8 million in fiscal 2006 from $4.0 million in fiscal 2005. The following contributed to the $2.8 million increase in net revenue from our other segment: • warehouse and showroom sales accounted for $2.1 million, or 73.7%, of the increase due to four warehouse sales in fiscal 2006 compared to one new warehouse sale in fiscal 2005 and three showrooms open at the end of fiscal 2006 compared to one showroom open at the end of fiscal 2005; • phone sale revenue accounted for $0.5 million, or 17.9%, of the increase; and • new wholesale accounts at fitness clubs and yoga studios in the United States accounted for $0.2 million, or 8.4%, of the increase. Gross Profit Gross profit increased $33.0 million, or 76.9%, to $76.0 million in fiscal 2006 from $43.0 million in fiscal 2005. The increase in gross profit was driven principally by: • an increase of $55.2 million in net revenue from our corporate-owned stores segment; • an increase of $6.8 million in net revenue from our franchises segment; and • an increase of $2.8 million net revenue from in our other segment. This amount was partially offset by: • an increase in product costs of $22.2 million associated with our sale of goods through corporate-owned stores, franchises and other segments; • an increase in occupancy costs of $6.1 million due to higher occupancy costs in new markets; • an increase of $1.9 million in expenses related to our production, design and distribution departments (including stock-based compensation expense) principally due to the hiring of additional employees to support our growth, partially offset by the absence in fiscal 2006 of the cash bonus paid to employees in fiscal 2005 in conjunction with our recapitalization; and • an increase in depreciation of $1.6 million related to opening new corporate-owned stores. Gross profit as a percentage of net revenue, or gross margin, decreased 0.1%, to 51.0%, in fiscal 2006 from 51.1% in fiscal 2005. The decrease in gross margin resulted from: • higher occupancy costs in new markets that contributed to a decrease in gross margin of 2.1%; and • an increase in depreciation that contributed to a decrease in gross margin of 0.3% related to opening new corporate-owned stores. 41 Table of Contents The factors that led to a decrease in gross margin were offset by: • a decrease in product costs as a percentage of net revenue that contributed to an increase in gross margin of 0.7% due to an increase in pricing to our franchises and wholesale customers, partially offset by an increased percentage of our net revenue being derived from our oqoqo and factory outlet stores, which generate lower gross margins than our other corporate-owned stores, and a short-term increase in expenses during our transition to the use of more off-shore manufacturers; and • a decrease in expenses related to our production, design and distribution departments (including stock-based compensation expense) as a percentage of net revenue from fiscal 2005 to fiscal 2006 which contributed to an increase in gross margin of 1.6%. Our costs of goods sold in fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 included $0.4 million and $0.8 million, respectively, of stock-based compensation expense. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $26.1 million, or 98.9%, to $52.5 million in fiscal 2006 from $26.4 million in fiscal 2005. As a percentage of net revenue, selling, general and administrative expenses increased 3.9%, to 35.3% in 2006 from 31.4% in 2005. Of the $26.1 million increase in selling, general and administrative expenses: • $7.8 million, or 29.9%, resulted from an increase in store employee compensation related to opening additional corporate-owned stores; • $5.1 million, or 19.4%, resulted from an increase in consulting fees paid to third parties to analyze and implement new accounting and logistics processes and from an increase in fees associated with retaining professional search firms in connection with identifying qualified senior management candidates; • $4.6 million, or 17.7%, resulted from an increase in corporate compensation principally due to hiring of additional employees to support our growth, partially offset by the absence in fiscal 2006 of the cash bonus paid to employees in fiscal 2005 in conjunction with our recapitalization; • $3.9 million, or 15.1%, resulted from an increase in other corporate expenses such as travel expenses and rent associated with corporate facilities; • $3.6 million, or 13.7%, resulted from an increase in other store operating expenses such as supplies, packaging, and credit card fees; and • $0.6 million, or 2.1%, resulted from an increase in depreciation resulting from our move into a new corporate headquarters at the beginning of fiscal 2006. Our selling, general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 included $2.5 million and $1.9 million, respectively, of stock-based compensation expense. Principal Stockholder Bonus There was no principal stockholder bonus in fiscal 2006 due to the termination of the payment of a principal stockholder bonus at the end of fiscal 2005 as part of the stockholder’s sale of 48% of his interest in us to a group of private equity investors. Principal stockholder bonus was $12.8 million in fiscal 2005. Settlement of Lawsuit In February 2007, we settled a lawsuit with a third-party website developer arising from the termination of a profit sharing arrangement associated with our retail website for our products. In connection with the settlement, we paid $7.2 million in fiscal 2007, all of which was accrued in fiscal 2006. We did not incur any similar material liabilities during fiscal 2005. 42 Table of Contents Income from Operations The increase of $12.5 million in income from operations in fiscal 2006 was primarily due to a $33.0 million increase in gross profit resulting from increased comparable store sales and additional sales from corporate-owned stores opened during fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2006, and a $12.8 million decline in our principal stockholder bonus, partially offset by an increase of $26.1 million in selling, general and administrative expenses and the payment of $7.2 million in connection with a lawsuit settlement in fiscal 2006. On a segment basis, we determine income from operations without taking into account the payment of our principal stockholder bonus fiscal 2005, the settlement of a lawsuit in fiscal 2006 and our general corporate expenses such as corporate employee costs, travel expenses and corporate rent. For purposes of our management’s analysis of our financial results, we have allocated some general product expenses to our corporate-owned stores segment. For example, all expenses related to our production, design and distribution departments have been allocated to this segment. Income from operations (before general corporate expenses) from: • our corporate-owned stores segment increased $17.0 million, or 82.2%, to $37.8 million in fiscal 2006 from $20.7 million in fiscal 2005 primarily due to an increase in corporate-owned stores gross profit of $28.4 million, offset by an increase of $7.8 million in store employee expenses and an increase of $3.6 million in other store expenses; • our franchises segment increased $3.4 million to $10.7 million in fiscal 2006 from $7.3 million in fiscal 2005 primarily due to an increase of $2.4 million in royalty revenue and an increase of $0.9 million in gross profit associated with our sale of our products to franchises; and • our other segment increased $1.3 million to $2.7 million in fiscal 2006 from $1.5 million in fiscal 2005 primarily due to an increase in revenue of $2.8 million, offset by an increase of $1.5 million in product costs. Total income from operations also includes general corporate expenses. General corporate expenses increased $9.2 million, or 35.5%, to $35.0 million in fiscal 2006 from $25.8 million in fiscal 2005 primarily due to a lawsuit settlement of $7.2 million in fiscal 2006, an increase of $5.1 million in consulting and recruiting fees, an increase of $4.6 million in corporate employee costs, an increase of $3.9 million in other corporate expenses and an increase of $0.6 million in depreciation and amortization expense, partially offset by a $12.8 million decrease in our principal stockholder bonus. Interest Income Interest income increased to $141,736 in fiscal 2006 from $54,562 in fiscal 2005 due to higher average cash balances. Interest Expense Interest expense remained relatively constant at $47,348 in fiscal 2006 from $51,020 in fiscal 2005. Provision for Income Taxes Provision for income taxes increased $6.5 million, to $8.8 million in fiscal 2006 from $2.3 million in fiscal 2005. In fiscal 2006, our effective tax rate was 53.7% compared to 62.6% in fiscal 2005. In both fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2006, we generated losses in the United States which we were unable to offset against our income in Canada for tax purposes. In fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2006, we also incurred stock-based compensation expenses of $2.7 million and $2.8 million, respectively, which were not deductible for tax purposes during these periods. The impact of these losses and non-deductible expenses on our effective tax rate was exacerbated in fiscal 2005 by the payment of a bonus to our principal stockholder in that period. Prior to December 2005 our sole stockholder, Mr. Wilson, received a bonus payout each year representing a substantial percentage of our earnings before income taxes. We discontinued this practice following Mr. Wilson’s sale of 48% of his interest in lululemon to a group of private equity investors in December 2005. Payments of these bonuses therefore decreased to nil in fiscal 2006 from $12.8 million in fiscal 2005. This payment in fiscal 2005 dramatically decreased our income before income taxes in 43 Table of Contents this period and accordingly resulted in us realizing a higher effective tax rate in this period as we gave effect to the non-deductible nature of the losses and the stock-based compensation expenses. Net Income Net income increased $6.3 million, to $7.7 million in fiscal 2006 from $1.4 million in fiscal 2005. The increase in net income of $6.3 million in fiscal 2006 was a result of an increase in gross profit of $33.0 million resulting from increased comparable store sales and additional sales from corporate-owned stores opened during fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2006 and the elimination of our principal stockholder bonus in fiscal 2006, which accounted for an expense of $12.8 million in fiscal 2005, offset by increases in selling, general and administrative expenses of $26.1 million, the payment of $7.2 million in connection with a lawsuit settlement in fiscal 2006, and an increase of $6.5 million in provision for income taxes. Our cost of goods sold and selling, general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 included $2.8 million and $2.7 million of stock-based compensation expense, respectively. Seasonality In fiscal 2005, fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2007, we recognized over 35% of our net revenue in the fourth quarter due to significant increases in sales during the holiday season. We recognized 37%, 35% and 39% of our full year gross profit in the fourth quarter in fiscal 2005, fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2007, respectively. Despite the fact that we have experienced a significant amount of our net revenue and gross profit in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year, we believe that the true extent of the seasonality or cyclical nature of our business may have been overshadowed by our rapid growth to date. The level of our working capital reflects the seasonality of our business. We expect inventory, accounts payable and accrued expenses to be higher in the third and fourth quarters in preparation for the holiday selling season. Because our products are sold primarily through our stores, order backlog is not material to our business. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our cash requirements are principally for working capital and capital expenditures, principally the build-out cost of new stores, renovations of existing stores, and improvements to our distribution facility and corporate infrastructure. Our need for working capital is seasonal, with the greatest requirements from August through the end of November each year as a result of our inventory build-up during this period for our holiday selling season. Historically, our main sources of liquidity have been cash flow from operating activities, borrowings under our existing and previous revolving credit facilities, and proceeds from equity offerings, including our initial public offering. As of February 3, 2008, our working capital (excluding cash and cash equivalents) was $8.7 million and our cash and cash equivalents was $53.3 million. 44 Table of Contents The following table presents the major components of net cash flows provided by and used in operating, investing and financing activities for the periods indicated. Operating Activities Fiscal Year Ended January 31, January 31, February 3, 2006 2007 2008 (In thousands) Net income for the period $ 1,394 $ 7,666 $ 30,842 Items not affecting cash: Depreciation and amortization 2,466 4,619 8,341 Deferred income taxes (175 ) (3,077 ) 1,799 Stock-based compensation expense 2,700 2,830 5,947 Non-controlling interest 10 563 (334 ) Loss on property and equipment — 230 — Changes in non-cash working capital items (17,379 ) 13,293 (8,504 ) Cash flows from (used by) operating activities $ (10,984 ) $ 26,124 $ 38,091 Operating Activities consist primarily of net income adjusted for certain non-cash items, including depreciation and amortization, deferred income taxes, realized gains and losses on property and equipment, stock-based compensation expense and the effect of the changes in non-cash working capital items, principally accounts receivable, inventories, accounts payable and accrued expenses. In fiscal 2007, cash provided by operating activities increased $12.6 million, to $38.1 million compared to cash provided by operating activities of $25.4 million in fiscal 2006. The $12.6 million increase was primarily a result of: • an increase in net income of $23.2 million to $30.8 million in fiscal 2007 compared to $7.7 million in fiscal 2006; and • an increase in items not affecting cash of $11.3 million consisting of an increase of $4.9 million in deferred income taxes, an increase of $3.1 million in stock-based compensation expense, and an increase of $3.7 million in depreciation and amortization, offset by a decrease in non-controlling interest related to our joint venture in Japan of $0.2 million. This amount was partially offset by a net decrease in the change in other working capital balances of $21.8 million primarily due to: • a net decrease in the change in income taxes payable of $12.1 million; • a net decrease in accrued liabilities of $10.6 million; • a net increase in the change in inventories of $6.6 million; • a net increase in the change in tenant inducement receivable of $2.4 million; and • a net increase in prepaid expenses of $2.2 million. These amounts were offset by: • a net increase in the change in other current liabilities of $5.5 million; • a net decrease in tenant inducements received of $2.3 million; • a net decrease in the change in accounts receivable of $1.3 million; • a net decrease in related party receivables of $1.2 million; • a net increase in the change in trade accounts payable of $1.2 million; and • a net decrease in other current assets of $0.5 million. 45 Table of Contents Depreciation and amortization relate almost entirely to leasehold improvements, furniture and fixtures, computer hardware and software, equipment and vehicles in our stores and other corporate buildings. Depreciation and amortization increased $3.7 million to $8.3 million in fiscal 2007 from $4.6 million in fiscal 2006. Depreciation for our corporate-owned store segment was $6.2 million, $3.1 million and $1.5 million in fiscal 2007, fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005, respectively. Depreciation related to corporate activities was $2.1 million, $1.1 million and $0.5 million in fiscal 2007, fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005, respectively. We have not allocated any depreciation to our franchises or other segments as these amounts to date have been immaterial. Investing Activities Fiscal Year Ended January 31, January 31, February 3, 2006 2007 2008 (In thousands) Purchase of property and equipment $ (7,144 ) $ (12,838 ) $ (29,676 ) Acquisition of franchises (461 ) (512 ) (5,559 ) Cash flows from investing activities $ (7,605 ) $ (13,350 ) $ (35,235 ) Investing Activities relate entirely to capital expenditures and acquisitions of franchises. Cash used in investing activities increased $21.9 million, to $35.2 million in fiscal 2007 from $13.3 million in fiscal 2006. This increase in cash used in investing activities represents an increase in the number of new stores as well as store improvements on a larger store base. Capital expenditures for our corporate-owned stores segment were $20.7 million in fiscal 2007 which included $17.0 million to open 28 stores (not including one acquired franchise store), $11.3 million in fiscal 2006, which included $7.5 million to open 13 stores (not including one acquired franchise store), $6.1 million in fiscal 2005, which included $5.3 million to open 13 stores, and $2.8 million in fiscal 2004, which included $2.3 million to open seven stores. The remaining capital expenditures for our corporate-owned stores segment in each period were for ongoing store refurbishment. Capital expenditures related to corporate activities and administration were $9.0 million, $2.0 million, $2.3 million and $1.0 million in fiscal 2007, fiscal 2006, fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004, respectively. The capital expenditures in each period for corporate activities and administration were for improvements at our head office and other corporate buildings as well as investments in information technology. There were no capital expenditures associated with our franchises and other segments. In fiscal 2005, fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2007, we purchased our franchises in Whistler, British Columbia for $0.5 million, Portland, Oregon for $0.5 million, and Calgary, Alberta for $5.6 million, respectively. Capital expenditures are expected to aggregate approximately $36 million in fiscal 2008, including approximately $18 million to $21 million for approximately 35 new stores, approximately $8 million for information technology enhancements, approximately $7 million for the build-out of our new corporate headquarters, and the remainder for ongoing store maintenance and for corporate activities. This does not include capital expenditures for our internet retail website which we expect to launch in late 2008 or early 2009. 46 Table of Contents Financing Activities Fiscal Year Ended January 31, January 31, February 3, 2006 2007 2008 (In thousands) Capital stock issued for cash $ 93,037 $ 446 $ 38,350 Payment of initial public offering costs — — (6,992 ) Distribution to principal stockholder (69,005 ) — — Proceeds from credit facility — — 1,455 Repayment of credit facility — — (1,455 ) Repayment of long-term debt (634 ) — — Amounts received from related party — — 564 Cash received on exercise of stock options — — 55 Funds received from principal stockholder loan 7,832 222 — Funds repaid on principal stockholder loan (11,143 ) — — Cash flows from financing activities $ 20,087 $ 668 $ 31,977 Financing Activities consist primarily of capital stock issued for cash and the related issuance costs, distributions to principal stockholder, repayment of long-term debt, funds received from and repaid on stockholder loan and changes in bank indebtedness. Cash provided by financing activities increased $31.3 million, to $32.0 million in fiscal 2007 from $0.7 million in fiscal 2006. The increase in cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to a $38.4 million issuance of capital stock as part of our initial public offering, offset by offering costs of $7.0 million, in fiscal 2007. We believe that our cash from operations, proceeds from our initial public offering and borrowings available to us under our revolving credit facility will be adequate to meet our liquidity needs and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 24 months. Our cash from operations may be negatively impacted by a decrease in demand for our products as well as the other factors described in “Risk Factors.” In addition, we may make discretionary capital improvements with respect to our stores, distribution facility, headquarters, or other systems, which we would expect to fund through the issuance of debt or equity securities or other external financing sources to the extent we were unable to fund such capital expenditures out of our cash from operations. Revolving Credit Facility In April 2007, we entered into an uncommitted senior secured demand revolving credit facility with Royal Bank of Canada. The revolving credit facility provides us with available borrowings in an amount up to CDN$20.0 million. The revolving credit facility must be repaid in full on demand and is available by way of prime loans in Canadian currency, U.S. base rate loans in U.S. currency, bankers’ acceptances, LIBOR based loans in U.S. currency or Euro currency, letters of credit in Canadian currency or U.S. currency and letters of guaranty in Canadian currency or U.S. currency. The revolving credit facility bears interest on the outstanding balance in accordance with the following: (i) prime rate for prime loans; (ii) U.S. base rate for U.S. based loans; (iii) a fee of 1.125% per annum on bankers’ acceptances; (iv) LIBOR plus 1.125% per annum for LIBOR based loans; (v) a 1.125% annual fee for letters of credit; and (vi) a 1.125% annual fee for letters of guaranty. Both lululemon usa inc. and lululemon FC USA inc., Inc. provided Royal Bank of Canada with guarantees and postponements of claims in the amounts of CDN$20.0 million with respect to lululemon athletica canada inc.’s obligations under the revolving credit facility. The revolving credit facility is also secured by all of our present and after acquired personal property, including all intellectual property and all of the outstanding shares we own in our subsidiaries. As of February 3, 2008, aside from the letters of credit and guarantees, we had no borrowings outstanding under this credit facility. Contractual Obligations and Commitments Leases. We lease certain retail locations, storage spaces, building and equipment under non-cancelable operating leases. Our leases generally have initial terms of between five and 10 years, and generally can be extended 47 Table of Contents only in five-year increments (at increased rates) if at all. Our leases expire at various dates between 2008 and 2019, excluding extensions at our option. A substantial number of our leases for retail premises include renewal options and certain of our leases include rent escalation clauses, rent holidays and leasehold rental incentives, none of which are reflected in the following table. Most of our leases for retail premises also include contingent rental payments based on sales volume, the impact of which also are not reflected in the following table. The following table summarizes our contractual arrangements as of February 3, 2008, and the timing and effect that such commitments are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods: Payments Due by Year Ending Total 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Thereafter (In thousands) Operating Leases (minimum rent)* $ 175,105 $ 17,114 $ 20,539 $ 19,707 $ 18,037 $ 17,952 $ 81,756 * Includes $250, $250, $250 and $270 for each of the years ended January 31, 2009, 2010, 2011 and thereafter for one store lease which was terminated on May 15, 2007. Franchise Agreements. As of February 3, 2008, we operated seven stores in North America and three stores in Australia through franchise agreements. Under the terms of our franchise agreements, unless otherwise approved by us, franchisees are permitted to sell only lululemon athletica products, are required to purchase their inventory from us, which we sell at a slight premium to our cost, and are required to pay us a royalty based on a percentage of their gross sales. Additionally, under some of our franchise agreements, we have the ability to repurchase franchises at a price equal to a specified percentage of trailing 12-month sales. Pursuant to one of our franchise agreements, the franchisee has the right to sell his interest in the franchise back to us by June 2008. As of February 3, 2008, if the franchisee elected to sell his interest in the franchise to us, our repurchase costs for this franchise would have been approximately $0.6 million. During the year ended January 31, 2007, we and a franchisee mutually terminated our franchise agreement. The franchisee had commenced operations during the prior year. We paid the franchisee a negotiated amount of $527,590 that was recognized as a loss on the termination of the agreement and charged to selling, general and administrative expenses. The amount represented compensation for working capital that we abandoned and the return of the initial franchise fee of $10,000. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We enter into documentary letters of credit to facilitate the international purchase of merchandise. We also enter into standby letters of credit to secure certain of our obligations, including insurance programs and duties related to import purchases. As of February 3, 2008, letters of credit and letters of guaranty totaling $2.4 million have been issued. Other than these standby letters of credit, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, investments in special purpose entities or undisclosed borrowings or debt. In addition, we have not entered into any derivative contracts or synthetic leases. Commencing July 7, 2003, our principal stockholder, Mr. Wilson, held an interest in a company that manufactured finished goods exclusively for us. Mr. Wilson sold his interest in this manufacturing company in December 2006. As a result of the relationships between us, Mr. Wilson and the manufacturing company, we had a variable interest in the manufacturing company. We have concluded that we were not the primary beneficiary of this variable interest entity, and we have not consolidated the entity. The assets, liabilities, results of operations and cash flows of the manufacturing company have not been included in our consolidated financial statements. We were not exposed directly or indirectly to any losses of the manufacturing company. Following Mr. Wilson’s sale of his interests in the manufacturing company in December 2006, we no longer have a variable interest in the manufacturing company. 48 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions. Predicting future events is inherently an imprecise activity and, as such, requires the use of judgment. Actual results may vary from estimates in amounts that may be material to the financial statements. An accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically, could materially impact our consolidated financial statements. We believe that the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements: Revenue Recognition. Net revenue is comprised of corporate-owned store net revenue, which includes sales to customers through corporate-owned stores (including stores operated by our majority-owned joint venture), franchise licensing fees and royalties as well as sales of products to franchisees, and other net revenue, which includes sales to wholesale accounts, telephone sales, including related shipping and handling charges, warehouse sales and sales from company-operated showrooms, in each case, less returns and discounts. Sales to customers through corporate-owned stores are recognized at the point of sale, net of an estimated allowance for sales returns. Franchise licensing fees and royalties are recognized when earned, in accordance with the terms of the franchise/license agreements. Royalties are based on a percentage of the franchisees’ sales and recognized when those sales occur. Franchise fee net revenue arising from the sale of a franchise is recognized when the agreement has been signed and all of our substantial obligations have been completed. Other net revenue, generated by sales to wholesale accounts, telephone sales, including related shipping and handling charges, and showroom sales are recognized when those sales occur, net of an estimated allowance for sales returns. Other net revenue related to warehouse sales are recognized when these sales occur. Amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling are recognized at the time of shipment. Sales are reported on a net revenue basis, which is computed by deducting from our gross sales the amount of sales taxes, actual product returns received, discounts and an amount established for anticipated sales returns. Our estimated allowance for sales returns is a subjective critical estimate that has a direct impact on reported net revenue. This allowance is calculated based on a history of actual returns, estimated future returns and any significant future known or anticipated events. Consideration of these factors results in an estimated allowance for sales returns. Our standard terms for retail sales limit returns to approximately 14 days after the sale of the merchandise. For our wholesale sales, we allow returns from our wholesale customers if properly requested and approved. Employee discounts are classified as a reduction of net revenue. We account for gift cards by recognizing a liability at the time a gift card is sold, and recognizing net revenue at the time the gift card is redeemed for merchandise. We review our gift card liability on an ongoing basis and recognize our estimate of the unredeemed gift card liability on a ratable basis over the estimated period of redemption. Accounts Receivable. Accounts receivable primarily arise out of sales to wholesale accounts, sales of products and royalties on sales owed to us by our franchises. The allowance for doubtful accounts represents management’s best estimate of probable credit losses in accounts receivable. This allowance is established based on the specific circumstances associated with the credit risk of the receivable, the size of the accounts receivable balance, aging of accounts receivable balances and our collection history and other relevant information. The allowance for doubtful accounts is reviewed on a monthly basis. Receivables are charged to the allowance when management believes the account will not be recovered. Inventory. Inventory is valued at the lower of cost and market. Cost is determined using standard costs, which approximate the average costs. For finished goods and work-in-process, market is defined as net realizable value, and for raw materials, market is defined as replacement cost. Cost of inventories includes all costs incurred to deliver inventory to our distribution centers including freight, duty and other landing costs. During fiscal 2006, we initiated a new purchasing strategy that requires our manufacturers to acquire the raw materials used in the manufacturing of our apparel products. Because we will no longer be required to acquire these raw materials, we expect raw materials and work in process inventories to decline. 49 Table of Contents We periodically review our inventories and make provisions as necessary to appropriately value obsolete or damaged goods. The amount of the markdown is equal to the difference between the book cost of the inventory and its estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demands, selling prices and market conditions. In fiscal 2006, we wrote-off $1.0 million of inventory, and in fiscal 2007 we wrote-off $0.4 million of inventory. Property and Equipment. Property and equipment are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation. Costs related to software used for internal purposes are capitalized in accordance with the provisions of the Statement of Position 98-1, “Accounting for Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use” whereby direct internal and external costs incurred during the application development stage or for upgrades that add functionality are capitalized. All other costs related to internal use software are expensed as incurred. Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the lesser of the length of the lease, without consideration of option renewal periods and the estimated useful life of the assets, up to a maximum of five years. All other property and equipment are amortized using the declining balance method as follows: Furniture and fixtures 20 % Computer hardware and software 30 % Equipment and vehicles 30 % Long-Lived Assets. Long-lived assets held for use are evaluated for impairment when the occurrence of events or changes in circumstances indicates that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable as measured by comparing their net book value to the estimated future cash flows generated by their use and eventual disposition. Impaired assets are recorded at fair value, determined principally by discounting the future cash flows expected from their use and eventual disposition. Reductions in asset values resulting from impairment valuations are recognized in earnings in the period that the impairment is determined. Long-lived assets held for sale are reported at the lower of the carrying value of the asset and fair value less cost to sell. Any write-downs to reflect fair value less selling cost is recognized in income when the asset is classified as held for sale. Gains or losses on assets held for sale and asset dispositions are included in selling, general and administrative expenses. Income Taxes. We follow the liability method with respect to accounting for income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates that will be in effect when these differences are expected to reverse. Deferred income tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance, if based on the weight of available positive and negative evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Goodwill and Intangible Assets. Intangible assets are recorded at cost. Non-competition agreements are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life of five years. Reacquired franchise rights are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives of 10 years. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair market value of identifiable net assets acquired and is not amortized. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually or more frequently when an event or circumstance indicates that goodwill might be impaired. We use our best estimates and judgment based on available evidence in conducting the impairment testing. When the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess of the carrying value over its fair market value. Stock-Based Compensation. We account for stock-based compensation using the fair value method as required by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 — (Revised 2004), “Share Based Payments” (SFAS 123(R)). The fair value of awards granted is estimated at the date of grant and recognized as employee compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period with the offsetting credit to additional paid-in capital. Our calculation of stock-based compensation requires us to make a number of complex and subjective estimates and assumptions, including future forfeitures, stock price volatility, expected life of the options and related tax effects. Prior to our initial public offering, our board of directors determined the estimated fair value of our common stock on the date of grant based on a number of factors, most significantly our implied enterprise value based upon the purchase price of our securities sold in December 2005 pursuant to an arms-length private placement to a group of private equity investors. The estimation of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment, and to the extent actual results differ from our estimates, such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised. We consider several factors when estimating expected 50 Table of Contents forfeitures, such as types of awards, size of option holder group and anticipated employee retention. Actual results may differ substantially from these estimates. Expected volatility of the stock is based on our review of companies we believe of similar growth and maturity and our peer group in the industry in which we do business because we do not have sufficient historical volatility data for our own stock. The expected term of options granted is derived from the output of the option valuation model and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding. In the future, as we gain historical data for volatility in our own stock and the actual term employees hold our options, expected volatility and expected term may change which could substantially change the grant-date fair value of future awards of stock options and, ultimately, the expense we record. For awards with service and/or performance conditions, the total amount of compensation expense to be recognized is based on the number of awards that are expected to vest and is adjusted to reflect those awards that do ultimately vest. For awards with performance conditions, we recognize the compensation expense over the requisite service period as determined by a range of probability weighted outcomes. For awards with market and or performance conditions, all compensation expense is recognized if the underlying market or performance conditions are fulfilled. Certain employees are entitled to share-based awards from one of our stockholders. These awards are accounted for as employee compensation expense in accordance with the above noted policies. We commenced applying SFAS 123(R) when we introduced share based awards for our employees in the year ended January 31, 2006. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In December 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 160 (FAS 160), “Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements.” FAS 160 changes the classification of noncontrolling (minority) interests on the balance sheet and the accounting for and reporting of transactions between the reporting entity and holders of such noncontrolling interests. Under the new standard, noncontrolling interests are considered equity and are to be reported as an element of stockholders’ equity rather than within the mezzanine or liability sections of the balance sheet. In addition, the current practice of reporting minority interest expense or benefit also will change. Under the new standard, net income will encompass the total income before minority interest expense. The income statement will include separate disclosure of the attribution of income between the controlling and noncontrolling interests. Increases and decreases in the noncontrolling ownership interest amount are to be accounted for as equity transactions. FAS 160 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008 and earlier application is prohibited. Upon adoption, the balance sheet and the income statement will be recast retrospectively for the presentation of noncontrolling interests. The other accounting provisions of the statement are required to be adopted prospectively. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that adopting FAS 160 will have on its financial position and results of operations. In February 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 159, “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities” (FAS 159). This Statement permits entities to choose to measure various financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected are reported in earnings. FAS 159 is effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2008. The Company is currently evaluating the impact, if any, that adopting FAS 159 will have on its consolidated financial statements. In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements” (FAS 157), which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. FAS 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. The Company is currently evaluating the impact, if any, that adopting FAS 157 will have on its consolidated financial statements. In June 2006, the FASB issued Financial Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes” — an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48), which provides additional guidance and clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income tax positions. FIN 48 defines the threshold for recognizing a tax return position in the financial statements as “more likely than not” that the position is sustainable, based on its technical merits. FIN 48 also provides guidance on the measurement, classification and disclosure of tax return positions in the financial statements. FIN 48 is effective for the first reporting period beginning after December 15, 2006, with the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle recorded as an adjustment to the beginning balance of 51 Table of Contents retained earnings in the period of adoption. The adoption of FIN 48 did not have any effect on the Company’s financial position or results of operation. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates. Our market risk exposure is primarily a result of fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. We do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. Foreign Currency Exchange Risk. We currently generate a majority of our net revenue in Canada. The reporting currency for our consolidated financial statements is the U.S. dollar. Historically, our operations were based largely in Canada. However, since fiscal 2003, we have opened 25 stores in the United States, three stores in Australia and four stores in Japan. As a result, we have been impacted by changes in exchange rates and may be impacted materially for the foreseeable future. For example, because we recognize net revenue from sales in Canada in Canadian dollars, if the U.S. dollar strengthens it would have a negative impact on our Canadian revenue upon translation of those results into U.S. dollars for the purposes of consolidation. The exchange rate of the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar is currently near a multi-year high. If the Canadian dollar were to weaken relative to the U.S. dollar, our net revenue would decline and our income from operations and net income could be adversely affected. A 10% appreciation in the relative value of the U.S. dollar compared to the Canadian dollar would have resulted in lost income from operations of approximately $4.0 million in fiscal 2006 and approximately $5.4 million in fiscal 2007. To the extent the ratio between our net revenue generated in Canadian dollars increases as compared to our expenses generated in Canadian dollars, we expect that our results of operations will be further impacted by changes in exchange rates. We do not currently hedge foreign currency fluctuations. However, in the future, in an effort to mitigate losses associated with these risks, we may at times enter into derivative financial instruments, although we have not historically done so. These may take the form of forward sales contracts and option contracts. We do not, and do not intend to, engage in the practice of trading derivative securities for profit. Interest Rate Risk. In April 2007, we entered into an uncommitted senior secured demand revolving credit facility with Royal Bank of Canada. The revolving credit facility provides us with available borrowings in an amount up to CDN$20.0 million. Because our revolving credit facility bears interest at a variable rate, we will be exposed to market risks relating to changes in interest rates, if we have a meaningful outstanding balance. As of February 3, 2008, we had no outstanding borrowings under our revolving facility. We have maintained small outstanding balances during the third and fourth quarters as we build inventory and working capital for the holiday selling season, but we do not believe we are significantly exposed to changes in interest rate risk. We currently do not engage in any interest rate hedging activity and currently have no intention to do so in the foreseeable future. However, in the future, if we have a meaningful outstanding balance, in an effort to mitigate losses associated with these risks, we may at times enter into derivative financial instruments, although we have not historically done so. These may take the form of forward sales contracts, option contracts, and interest rate swaps. We do not, and do not intend to, engage in the practice of trading derivative securities for profit. Inflation Inflationary factors such as increases in the cost of our product and overhead costs may adversely affect our operating results. Although we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations to date, a high rate of inflation in the future may have an adverse effect on our ability to maintain current levels of gross margin and selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenue if the selling prices of our products do not increase with these increased costs. 52",2023-12-30 21:53:31.706827
1397187,LULU,lululemon athletica inc.,2009,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the “Selected Consolidated Financial Data” section and our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition, this discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements based on current expectations that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions, such as our plans, objectives, expectations and intentions set forth in the “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.” Our actual results and the timing of events may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth in the “Item 1A — Risk Factors” section and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Certain tables may not sum due to rounding. For fiscal years through fiscal 2006, our fiscal year ended on January 31st in the year following the year mentioned. Commencing with fiscal 2007, our fiscal year will end on the Sunday closest to January 31st of the following year, typically resulting in a fifty-two week year, but occasionally giving rise to an additional week, resulting in a fifty-three week year. Fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006 ended on February 1, 2009, February 3, 2008 and January 31, 2007, respectively Overview The world economy slowed considerably during fiscal 2008 as problems in global financial markets became more widespread and consumers cut back on retail spending amid fears of a global recession. Our sales growth slowed in the latter part of the third quarter of 2008, driven in part by this reduced spending. We believe that the challenging economic climate combined with the effect of the depreciation in the relative value of the Canadian dollar compared to the U.S. dollar will continue to adversely affect our fiscal 2009 projections for sales and margin rates. The current overall economic climate will result in a continued slowing of sales growth and have a negative impact on our gross margins in our 2009 fiscal year. Given the current economic conditions, our comparable store sales results and results of operations during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2008 have been negatively affected, and we believe that fiscal 2009 will also be negatively affected by continued reduced consumer spending and the short-term volatility of foreign exchange rates, particularly in Canada. lululemon is highly sensitive to increases and decreases in consumer spending. Increased consumer spending in our corporate-owned store locations create sales leverage, meaning that fixed expenses, such as occupancy costs, are spread across a greater revenue base, thereby improving operating margins. But the reverse is also true: sales deleveraging creates downward pressure on margins. The absence of growth in comparable store sales and soft results in new markets impacted nearly all consolidated operating expense line items when viewed as a percentage of total net sales. In response to the changes in the world economy and the impact on our operating results, we have taken steps to address the deterioration in the retail environment and address our support structure. These included the development and implementation of several important strategic initiatives as part of our strategy designed to increase customer traffic in our corporate-owned store locations, reduce infrastructure expenses and improve our operating results. These actions have been designed to structure our business for long-term profitable growth and protect our brand integrity. The more significant actions taken by lululemon in fiscal 2008 to invigorate our business included: • A plan for management to continue ongoing evaluations of our portfolio of corporate-owned store locations and to refine our real estate selection process. In fiscal 2008 we closed one corporate-owned store in Texas which was underperforming. As we continue our evaluation we may in future periods close additional corporate-owned store locations, dispose of property and equipment and exit in-place operating leases; • A reduction in employee head count both in our corporate-owned store locations and at head office, including changes in the structure between corporate-owned store locations and head office; • The introduction of temporary locations during the peak holiday selling season which enabled us to reach incremental customers and generate incremental full price sales as well as building additional awareness and demand for our brand in new markets; and • A reduction in discretionary spending and improved efficiencies brought about by our IT implementation. 28 Table of Contents Prior to changes in the world economy, we reevaluated our operating performance in Japan and our strategic priorities. This timely analysis led to our decision to discontinue our operations in Japan in fiscal 2008. In the second quarter of fiscal 2008 we closed three of our stores in Japan and closed our fourth and final store in Japan during the third quarter of fiscal 2008 and classified our Japanese operations as discontinued operations in the second quarter of fiscal 2008. Japan represented less than 1.5% of our revenues in fiscal 2007 and required a disproportionate amount of management time and attention during fiscal 2007. We agreed with Descente to end all operations as a joint venture in the third quarter of fiscal 2008. We believe that our time, attention and capital resources are best spent focused on our top priorities, which are growth in the United States, where we plan to open six stores during fiscal 2009, and the development of an e-commerce business. Management expects lululemon to continue to face a very difficult economic environment throughout fiscal 2009, in both North America and internationally. We expect to report negative comparable store sales for fiscal 2009. Additionally, our earnings for fiscal 2009 may be impacted by additional provisions for asset impairment and lease exit costs if management identifies additional underperforming corporate-owned store locations to close. lululemon plans to be disciplined in its approach to new store openings, in both existing and new markets, and adjust as needed in response to further worsening in the world economy. Operating Segment Overview lululemon is a designer and retailer of technical athletic apparel operating primarily in North America. Our yoga-inspired apparel is marketed under the lululemon athletica brand name. We offer a comprehensive line of apparel and accessories including fitness pants, shorts, tops and jackets designed for athletic pursuits such as yoga, dance, running and general fitness. As of February 1, 2009, our branded apparel was principally sold through 113 corporate-owned and franchise stores that are primarily located in Canada and the United States. We believe our vertical retail strategy allows us to interact more directly with and gain insights from our customers while providing us with greater control of our brand. In fiscal 2008, 68.9% of our net revenue was derived from sales of our products in Canada, 31.1% of our net revenue was derived from the sales of our products in the United States and an immaterial amount of our net revenue was derived from sales of our products outside of North America. In fiscal 2007, 80.3% of our net revenue was derived from sales of our products in Canada, 19.7% of our net revenue was derived from the sales of our products in the United States and an immaterial amount of our net revenue was derived from sales of our products outside of North America. In fiscal 2006, 87.1% of our net revenue was derived from sales of our products in Canada, 11.7% of our net revenue was derived from the sales of our products in the United States and 1.2% of our net revenue was derived from sales of our products outside of North America. Our net revenue has grown from $40.7 million in fiscal 2004 to $353.5 million in fiscal 2008. This represents a compound net annual growth rate of 71.6%. Our net revenue from continuing operations also increased from $269.9 million in fiscal 2007 to $353.5 million in fiscal 2008, representing an 30.9% increase. Our increase in net revenue from fiscal 2004 to fiscal 2008 resulted from the addition of 35 retail locations in fiscal 2008, 31 retail locations in fiscal 2007, 14 retail locations in fiscal 2006 and 17 retail locations in fiscal 2005, and comparable store sales growth of 0%, 34%, 25% and 19% in fiscal 2008, fiscal 2007, fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005, respectively. Our ability to open new stores and grow sales in existing stores has been driven by increasing demand for our technical athletic apparel and a growing recognition of the lululemon athletica brand. We believe our superior products, strategic store locations, inviting store environment, grassroots marketing approach and distinctive corporate culture are responsible for our strong financial performance. We have recently increased our focus on our men’s apparel line, net revenue from which increased 39% in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 and represented approximately 12% of net revenue in fiscal 2008 versus 10% of net revenue in fiscal 2007, and our accessories business, which represented approximately 9% and 10% of net revenue for each of fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007, respectively. We have three reportable segments: corporate-owned stores, franchises and other. We report our segments based on the financial information we use in managing our businesses. While we receive financial information for each corporate-owned store, we have aggregated all of the corporate-owned stores into one reportable segment due to the similarities in the economic and other characteristics of these stores. Our franchises segment accounted for 4.6% of our net revenues from continuing operations in fiscal 2008, 6.7% in fiscal 2007 and 14.3% in fiscal 2006. Opening new franchise stores is not a significant part of our near-term growth strategy, and we therefore expect that if the revenue derived from our franchise stores continues to comprise less than 10% of the net revenue we report in 29 Table of Contents future fiscal years, we will re-evaluate our segment reporting disclosures. Our other operations accounted for less than 10% of our net revenues from continuing operations in each of fiscal 2008, fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006. As of February 1, 2009, we sold our products through 103 corporate-owned stores located in Canada and the United States. As previously disclosed, we discontinued our operations in Japan in the third quarter of fiscal 2008. We plan to increase our net revenue in North America by opening additional corporate-owned stores in new and existing markets. Corporate-owned stores net revenue accounted for 89.3% of total net revenue in fiscal 2008 and 89.1% of total net revenue in fiscal 2007. As of February 1, 2009, we also had five franchise stores located in North America and five franchise stores located in Australia. In the past, we have entered into franchise agreements to distribute lululemon athletica branded products to more quickly disseminate our brand name and increase our net revenue and net income. In exchange for the use of our brand name and the ability to operate lululemon athletica stores in certain regions, our franchisees generally pay us a one-time franchise fee and ongoing royalties based on their gross revenue. Additionally, unless otherwise approved by us, our franchisees are required to sell only lululemon athletica branded products, which are purchased from us at a discount to the suggested retail price. Pursuing new franchise partnerships or opening new franchise stores is not a significant part of our near-term store growth strategy. In some cases, we may exercise our contractual rights to purchase franchises where it is attractive to us. We believe that our athletic apparel has and will continue to appeal to consumers outside of North America who value its technical attributes as well as its function and style. In 2004, we opened our first franchise store in Australia. During fiscal 2008 we invested in LULULEMON ATHLETICA (AUSTRALIA) PTY LTD. which operates five franchise stores. In 2005, we opened a franchise store in Japan. In 2006, we terminated our franchise arrangement and entered into a joint venture agreement with Japanese apparel company Descente Ltd, or Descente, a global leader in fabric technology, to operate our stores in Japan, which were discontinued in fiscal 2008. In addition to deriving revenue from sales through our corporate-owned stores and our franchises, we also derive other net revenue, which includes the sale of our products directly to wholesale customers, telephone sales to retail customers, including related shipping and handling charges, warehouse sales and sales through a limited number of company-operated showrooms. Wholesale customers include select premium yoga studios, health clubs and fitness centers. Telephone sales are taken directly from retail customers through our call center. Warehouse sales are typically held one or more times a year to sell slow moving inventory or inventory from prior seasons to retail customers at discounted prices. Our showrooms are typically small locations that we open from time to time when we enter new markets and feature a limited selection of our product offering during select hours. Other net revenue accounted for 6.1% of total net revenue in fiscal 2008 and 4.2% of total net revenue in fiscal 2007. Basis of Presentation Net revenue is comprised of: • corporate-owned store net revenue, which includes sales to customers through corporate-owned stores; • franchises net revenue, which consists of licensing fees and royalties as well as sales of our products to franchises; and • other net revenue, which includes sales to wholesale accounts, telephone sales, warehouse sales and sales from company-operated showrooms. in each case, less returns and discounts. In addition, we separately track comparable store sales, which reflect net revenue at corporate-owned stores that have been open for at least 12 months. Therefore, net revenue from a store is included in comparable store sales beginning with the first month for which the store has a full month of comparable prior year sales. Comparable store sales include stores that have been remodeled or relocated. Non-comparable store sales include sales from new stores that have not been open for 12 months, sales from showrooms, and sales from stores that were closed within the past 12 months. 30 Table of Contents By measuring the change in year-over-year net revenue in stores that have been open for 12 months or more, comparable store sales allows us to evaluate how our core store base is performing. Various factors affect comparable store sales, including: • the location of new stores relative to existing stores; • consumer preferences, buying trends and overall economic trends; • our ability to anticipate and respond effectively to customer preferences for technical athletic apparel; • competition; • changes in our merchandise mix; • pricing; • the timing of our releases of new merchandise and promotional events; • the effectiveness of our grassroots marketing efforts; • the level of customer service that we provide in our stores; • our ability to source and distribute products efficiently; and • the number of stores we open, close (including for temporary renovations) and expand in any period. As we continue our store expansion program, we expect that a greater percentage of our net revenue will come from non-comparable store sales. Opening new stores is an important part of our growth strategy. Accordingly, comparable store sales has limited utility for assessing the success of our growth strategy insofar as comparable store sales do not reflect the performance of stores open less than 12 months. Cost of goods sold includes: • the cost of purchased merchandise, inbound freight, duty and non-refundable taxes incurred in delivering goods to our distribution centers; • the cost of our production, merchandise and design departments including salaries, stock-based compensation and benefits, and operating expenses; • the cost of occupancy related to store operations (such as rent and utilities) and the depreciation and amortization related to store-level capital expenditures; • the cost of our distribution centers (such as rent and utilities) as well as other fees we pay to third parties to operate our distribution centers and the depreciation and amortization related to our distribution centers; • hemming; and • shrink and valuation reserves. Cost of goods sold also may change as we open or close stores because of the resulting change in related occupancy costs. The primary drivers of the costs of individual goods are the costs of raw materials and labor in the countries where we source our merchandise. In fiscal 2008, fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006, cost of goods sold included $0.8 million, $0.7 million and $0.4 million, respectively, of charges related to stock-based compensation. Our selling, general and administrative expenses consist of all operating costs not otherwise included in cost of goods sold, provision for impairment and lease exit costs and settlement of lawsuit. Our selling, general and administrative expenses include marketing costs, accounting costs, information technology costs, professional fees, corporate facility costs, corporate and store-level payroll and benefits expenses including stock-based compensation (other than the salaries and benefits and stock-based compensation for our production, merchandise and design departments included in cost of goods sold and other corporate costs). In fiscal 2008, fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006, selling, general and administrative expenses included $5.8 million, $5.2 million and $2.3 million, respectively, of charges related to stock-based compensation. Our selling, general and administrative expenses also include depreciation and amortization expense for all assets other than depreciation and amortization expenses related to store-level capital expenditures and our distribution centers, each of which are included in cost of goods sold. We anticipate that our selling, general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars due to anticipated continued growth of our corporate support staff and store-level employees. 31 Table of Contents Provision for impairment and lease exit costs consists of asset impairments, lease exit and other related costs associated with the closure of one US corporate-owned store in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 as well as an asset impairment provision based on management’s ongoing evaluation of its portfolio of corporate-owned store locations. Long-lived assets are reviewed at the store level periodically for impairment or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that full recoverability of net assets through future cash flows is in question. Factors used in the evaluation include, but are not limited to, management’s plans for future operations, recent operating results and projected cash flows. Settlement of lawsuit consists of a payment we made in February 2007 in the amount of $7.2 million to a third party website developer arising from the termination of a profit sharing arrangement associated with our retail website for our products. We accrued for the entire settlement amount in fiscal 2006. Stock-based compensation expense includes charges incurred in recognition of compensation expense associated with grants of stock options, grants of restricted stock units, and stock purchases. In December 2005, we adopted the fair value recognition and measurement provisions of SFAS No. 123(R), Share-Based Payment (SFAS 123(R)). SFAS 123(R) is applicable to stock-based awards exchanged for employee services and in certain circumstances for non-employee directors. We recognize stock-based compensation expense for both awards granted by us and awards granted under a stockholder sponsored plan. Pursuant to SFAS 123(R), stock-based compensation expense is measured at the grant date, based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as an expense over the requisite service period. Prior to our initial public offering in July 2007, the fair value of the shares of common stock that underlie the stock options we granted was determined by our board of directors. Our board of directors determined a valuation of lululemon as of April 30, 2006. The valuation was calculated based upon the equity value implied by the December 2005 transaction in which Mr. Wilson sold 48% of his interest in lululemon to a group of private equity investors for approximately $193.3 million. At the time, our board of directors believed the December 2005 transaction was a valid indication of fair value because the terms of the December 2005 transaction were the result of arms-length negotiations among independent parties. Because there had been no public market for our common stock, our board used this valuation to determine the fair value of our common stock at the time of grant of the options. In connection with the preparation of the financial statements necessary for our initial public offering and based in part on discussions with prospective underwriters for the planned offering, in March 2007 we reassessed the estimated accounting fair value as of January 2007 of common stock in light of the potential completion of the initial public offering. After reviewing its valuation, our board of directors determined that the valuation would not be appropriate for valuing the options as the valuation did not fully consider requirements under SFAS 123(R) and other relevant regulatory guidelines, specifically: • the valuation did not coincide with the option grant dates; and • the valuation incorrectly included a minority interest discount. As a result, management determined that it would be necessary to retrospectively calculate a new valuation for the July 2006 option grants. Based upon the reassessment, we determined that the accounting fair value of the options granted to employees from February 1, 2006 to January 31, 2007 was greater than the exercise price for certain of those options. The comparison of the originally determined fair value and reassessed fair value is as follows for all dates on which an option was granted, assuming that our corporate reorganization had occurred and using the initial public offering price of $18.00 per share: Initial Original Number of Public Fair Value Reassessed Options Exercise Offering Assessment Fair Value Grant Date Granted Price Price of Options of Options July 3, 2006 2,899,186 $ 0.58 $ 18.00 $ 0.33 $ 0.91 December 6, 2006 5,955 $ 0.58 $ 18.00 $ 0.33 $ 8.09 December 27, 2006 1,309,008 $ 0.58 $ 18.00 $ 0.33 $ 8.09 January 3, 2007 357,335 $ 0.58 $ 18.00 $ 0.33 $ 8.09 Based upon the reassessment discussed above, we determined the reassessed accounting fair value of the options to purchase 4,571,484 shares of common stock granted to employees during the period from February 1, 32 Table of Contents 2006 to January 31, 2007 ranged from $0.91 to $8.09 per share. As a result of the reassessed fair value of our grants of stock options, the aggregate fair value of our stock options increased by $14.6 million. Stock-based compensation expense for the year ended January 31, 2007 includes the difference between the reassessed accounting fair value per share of the common stock on the date of grant and the exercise price per share and is amortized over the vesting period of the underlying options using the straight-line method. There are significant judgments and estimates inherent in the determination of the reassessed accounting fair values. For this and other reasons, the reassessed accounting fair value used to compute the stock-based compensation expense may not be reflective of the fair market value that would result from the application of other valuation methods, including accepted valuation methods for tax purposes. We record our stock-based compensation expense in cost of goods sold and selling, general and administrative expenses as stock-based awards have been made to employees whose salaries are classified in both expense categories. Interest income includes interest earned on our cash balances and our advances to franchise. We expect to continue to generate interest income to the extent that our cash generated from operations exceeds our cash used for investment. Interest expense includes interest costs associated with our credit facilities and with letters of credit drawn under these facilities for the purchase of merchandise. We have maintained relatively small outstanding balances on our credit facilities and expect to continue to do so. Provision for income taxes depends on the statutory tax rates in the countries where we sell our products. Historically we have generated taxable income in Canada and we have generated tax losses in the United States. For periods up to and including the second quarter of fiscal 2007, we recorded a full valuation allowance against our losses in the United States. In the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2007, we earned taxable income in the United States. During the second quarter of fiscal 2008, after considering a number of factors, including recent taxable income, utilization of previously unrealized NOL’s, our growth strategy as well as other business and macroeconomic factors, we determined that we would more likely than not realize the benefit of deferred tax assets through future taxable income. As a result of this analysis, we have recorded deferred tax assets in respect of the United States NOL’s, foreign tax credits and other deductible temporary differences of $17.9 million, of which $5.9 million has been recorded though income tax expense and $12.0 million through additional paid-in capital. Several factors have contributed to our effective tax rate in recent periods being significantly higher than our anticipated long-term effective tax rate. First, in fiscal 2008, fiscal 2007, fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005, we generated losses in the United States which we were unable to offset against our income in Canada. Second, in fiscal 2008, fiscal 2007, fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 we incurred stock-based compensation expense of $6.5 million, $5.9 million, $2.6 million and $2.7 million, respectively, a portion of which were not deductible for tax purposes in Canada and the United States during these periods. The impact of these losses and non-deductible expenses on our effective tax rate was exacerbated in fiscal 2005 by the payment of a bonus to our principal stockholder in that period. Prior to December 2005 our sole stockholder, Mr. Wilson, received a bonus payout each year representing a substantial percentage of our earnings before income taxes. Following Mr. Wilson’s sale of 48% of his interest in lululemon to a group of private equity investors in December 2005 we discontinued this practice. Payments of these bonuses therefore were eliminated in fiscal 2006 from $12.8 million in fiscal 2005. This payment in fiscal 2005 significantly decreased our income before income taxes in this period and accordingly resulted in us realizing a higher effective tax rate in this period as we gave effect to the non-deductible nature of the losses and the stock-based compensation expenses. Our effective tax rate in fiscal 2008 was 29.4%, compared to 38.9% in fiscal 2007, and 52.3% in fiscal 2006. We anticipate that in the future we may start to sell our products directly to some customers located outside of Canada, the United States and Australia, in which case we would become subject to taxation based on the foreign statutory rates in the countries where these sales take place and our effective tax rate could fluctuate accordingly. 33 Table of Contents Results of Operations The following tables summarize key components of our results of operations for the periods indicated, both in dollars and as a percentage of net revenue: Fiscal Year Ended February 1, February 3, January 31, 2009 2008 2007 (In thousands) Consolidated statements of operations: Net revenue $ 353,488 $ 269,942 $ 147,964 Cost of goods sold 174,421 125,015 72,249 Gross profit 179,067 144,927 75,715 Operating expenses: Selling, general and administrative expenses 118,098 93,376 51,863 Provision for impairment and lease exit costs 4,405 — — Settlement of lawsuit — — 7,228 Income from operations 56,564 51,551 16,624 Other income (expense), net 821 1,029 104 Income before provision for income taxes 57,385 52,580 16,728 Provision for income taxes 16,884 20,464 8,752 Net income from continuing operations 40,501 32,116 7,976 Net loss from discontinued operations (1,138 ) (1,273 ) (310 ) Net income $ 39,363 $ 30,843 $ 7,666 Fiscal Year Ended February 1, February 3, January 31, 2009 2008 2007 (% of net revenue) Net revenue 100.0 100.0 100.0 Cost of goods sold 49.3 46.3 48.8 Gross profit 50.7 53.7 51.2 Operating expenses: Selling, general and administrative expenses 33.4 34.6 35.1 Provision for impairment and lease exit costs 1.2 — — Settlement of lawsuit — — 4.9 Income from operations 16.0 19.1 11.2 Other income (expense), net 0.2 0.4 0.1 Income before provision for income taxes 16.2 19.5 11.3 Provision for income taxes 4.8 7.6 5.9 Net income from continuing operations 11.5 11.9 5.4 Net loss from discontinued operations (0.3 ) (0.5 ) (0.2 ) Net income 11.1 11.4 5.2 Comparison of Fiscal 2008 to Fiscal 2007 Net Revenue Net revenue increased $83.5 million, or 31%, to $353.5 million in fiscal 2008 from $269.9 million in fiscal 2007. This increase was primarily the result of sales from new stores opened. Assuming the average exchange rate between the Canadian and United States dollars in fiscal 2007 remained constant, our net revenue would have increased $92.6 million, or 34%, in fiscal 2008. The constant dollar increase in comparable store sales was driven 34 Table of Contents primarily by the strength of our existing product lines, successful introduction of new products and increasing recognition of the lululemon athletica brand name. Fiscal Year Ended February 1, February 3, 2009 2008 (In thousands) Net revenue by segment: Corporate-owned stores $ 315,548 $ 240,441 Franchises 16,198 18,141 Other 21,742 11,360 Total net revenue $ 353,488 $ 269,942 Corporate-Owned Stores. Net revenue from our corporate-owned stores segment increased $75.1 million, or 31%, to $315.5 million in fiscal 2008 from $240.4 million in fiscal 2007. The following contributed to the $75.1 million increase in net revenue from our corporate-owned stores segment: • New stores opened during fiscal 2008 contributed $37.3 million, or 16%, of the increase. During fiscal 2008, we opened 34 corporate-owned stores, consisting of three in Canada and 31 in the United States; • New stores opened during fiscal 2007 prior to sales from such stores becoming part of our comparable store sales base contributed $34.3 million, or 14%, of the increase. This consisted of five stores in Canada and 21 stores in the United States; and • The acquisition of two Victoria, British Columbia and one Bellevue, Washington franchise stores in September 2008 contributed $3.7 million, or 2%, of the increase. The increase was partially offset by comparable store sales decline in fiscal 2008, resulting in a $0.2 million decrease to net revenue. Assuming the average exchange rate between the Canadian and U.S. dollar in fiscal 2007 remained constant, our comparable store sales would have increased 3% in fiscal 2008 and contributed $7.5 million, or 3%, of the increase. Franchises. Net revenue from our franchises segment decreased $1.9 million, or 11%, to $16.2 million in fiscal 2008 from $18.1 million in fiscal 2007. The decrease in net revenue from our franchises segment consisted primarily of franchises net revenue of $2.7 million that shifted to corporate-owned stores net revenue when we acquired two franchise stores in Victoria, British Columbia and one franchise store in Bellevue, Washington. This was partially offset by increased franchise revenue of $0.8 million from our one remaining Canadian franchise location and four franchise locations in the United States. Other. Net revenue from our other segment increased $10.4 million, or 91%, to $21.7 million in fiscal 2008 from $11.4 million in fiscal 2007. The following contributed to the $10.4 million increase in net revenue from our other segment: • temporary store locations opened in fiscal 2008 contributed sales revenue of $3.2 million; • an additional warehouse sale in fiscal 2008 contributed increased sales revenue of $2.8 million; • two new outlet locations opened in fiscal 2008 contributed sales revenue of $2.0 million; • new and existing wholesale accounts contributed $1.2 million of the increase; • showroom sales revenue increased $0.9 million; and • phonesale revenue accounted for $0.4 million of the increase. 35 Table of Contents Gross Profit Gross profit increased $34.1 million, or 24%, to $179.1 million in fiscal 2008 from $144.9 million in fiscal 2007. The increase in gross profit was driven principally by: • an increase of $75.1 million in net revenue from our corporate-owned stores segment; and • an increase of $10.4 million in net revenue from our other segment. This amount was partially offset by: • an increase in product costs of $28.8 million associated with our sale of goods through corporate-owned stores, franchises and other segments; • an increase in occupancy costs of $12.8 million related to an increase in corporate-owned stores; • an increase in depreciation of $4.4 million primarily related to an increase in corporate-owned stores; • an increase of $2.1 million in expenses related to our production, design and merchandising departments; • a decrease of $1.9 million in net revenue from our franchise segment; and • an increase of $1.4 million in expenses related to distribution costs as a result of increased production to support our growth. Gross profit, as a percentage of net revenue, or gross margin, decreased 3.0%, to 50.7% in fiscal 2008 from 53.7% in fiscal 2007. The decrease in gross margin resulted from: • an increase in occupancy costs as a percentage of net revenue that contributed to a decrease in gross margin of 2.0% as a result of decreased sales per store and a resulting deleverage on fixed occupancy costs; • an increase in store depreciation expense as a percentage of net revenue in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 as a result of new store openings in new markets, which contributed to a decrease in gross margin of 0.7%; • an increase in product costs as a percentage of net revenue that contributed to a decrease in gross margin of 0.3%, primarily due to an increase in corporate-owned store product costs and increased mark-downs in consideration of the current economic climate; and • an increase in expenses related to our production, design and merchandising departments as a percentage of net revenue in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007, which contributed to a decrease in gross margin of 0.1%. Our costs of goods sold in fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007 included $0.8 million and $0.7 million, respectively, of stock-based compensation expense. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $24.7 million, or 26%, to $118.1 million in fiscal 2008 from $93.4 million in fiscal 2007. As a percentage of net revenue, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 1.2%, to 33.4%, in 2008 from 34.6% in 2007. Of the $24.7 million increase in selling, general and administrative expenses: • $8.7 million resulted from an increase in store employee compensation related to opening additional corporate-owned stores; • $7.0 million resulted from an increase in other store operating expenses primarily related to an increase of $2.6 million in employee costs such as commissions, bonuses, benefits and other employee costs, $1.6 million in credit card fees, $1.0 million in communications, phone and fax expense, $0.8 million in occupancy cost, $0.6 million in repairs and maintenance expense, and $0.3 million in travel expense; • $4.9 million resulted from an increase in corporate compensation principally due to hiring of additional employees to support our growth; 36 Table of Contents • $3.2 million resulted from an increase in depreciation related to property and equipment at the store support centre, including depreciation our recently implemented software systems; • $2.3 million resulted from an increase in professional fees as a result of increased regulatory requirements associated with being a public company such as advisory fees for internal control compliance and legal fees; and • $0.6 million resulted from an increase in stock-based compensation expense. This amount was partially offset by a decrease in distribution costs of $1.6 million and a decrease in foreign exchange losses of $0.4 million. Our selling, general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007 included $5.8 million and $5.2 million, respectively, of stock-based compensation expense. Income from Operations Income from operations increased $5.0 million, or 10%, to $56.6 million in fiscal 2008 from $51.6 million in fiscal 2007. The increase of $5.0 million in income from operations for fiscal 2008 was primarily due to a $34.1 million increase in gross profit resulting from sales from additional corporate-owned stores opened during fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007, offset by an increase of $24.7 million in selling, general and administrative expenses and a $4.4 million provision for impairment and lease exit costs. On a segment basis, we determine income from operations without taking into account our general corporate expenses such as corporate employee costs, travel expenses and corporate rent. For purposes of our management’s analysis of our financial results, we have allocated some general product expenses to our corporate-owned stores segment. For example, all expenses related to our production, design, merchandise and distribution departments have been allocated to this segment. Income from operations (before general corporate expenses) from: • our corporate-owned stores segment increased $15.0 million, or 19%, to $94.9 million for fiscal 2008 from $79.8 million for fiscal 2007 primarily due to an increase in corporate-owned stores gross profit of $32.9 million, offset by an increase of $12.8 million in store employee expenses, $3.4 million in administrative expenses, and an increase of $1.2 million in other store expenses; • our franchises segment decreased $1.2 million, or 14%, to $7.5 million in fiscal 2008 from $8.8 million in fiscal 2007 primarily as a result of franchise income from operations of $1.8 million included in the comparative period shifting to corporate-owned stores income from operations when we acquired two franchise stores in Victoria, British Columbia and one franchise store in Bellevue, Washington, partially offset by increased franchise income from operations of $0.6 million from our remaining franchise locations; and • our other segment increased $6.3 million, or 113%, to $11.9 million in fiscal 2008 from $5.6 million in fiscal 2007 primarily due to an increase in revenue of $10.4 million, offset by an increase of $4.1 million in product costs. Income from operations also includes general corporate expenses. General corporate expenses increased $15.0 million, or 35%, to $57.7 million in fiscal 2008 from $42.7 million in fiscal 2007 primarily due to an increase in corporate employee costs of $4.8 million, a provision for impairment and lease exit costs of $4.4 million, an increase in depreciation and amortization expense of $3.2 million, and an increase in other corporate expenses of $2.6 million. Our $4.4 million provision for impairment and lease exit costs was a result of management’s review of our portfolio of corporate-owned store locations. In conjunction with our ongoing evaluation to ensure that each of our corporate-owned stores fit into our long-term growth strategy we closed one of our corporate-owned stores in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008. We recorded a $0.7 million charge related to this closure, which included a $0.5 million asset impairment and a $0.2 million accrual for lease exit costs. The fair market values were estimated using an expected present value technique. We identified four other corporate-owned store locations where the carrying amount of the assets exceeded management’s estimate of the fair value of the location. Asset 37 Table of Contents impairment of $2.5 million was recorded as at February 1, 2009 related to these locations. Further, we accrued $1.2 million for lease exit costs related to certain locations which management has identified as underperforming corporate-owned store locations. Other Income, Net Other income, net decreased $0.2 million, or 20%, to $0.8 million in fiscal 2008 from $1.0 million in fiscal 2007. Of the $0.2 million decrease in other income, net: • $0.2 million resulted from a decrease in interest income; and • $0.1 million resulted from an increase in equity loss associated with our investment in Australia. This amount was partially offset by a $0.1 million decrease in interest expense. Provision for Income Taxes Provision for income taxes decreased $3.6 million, or 17%, to $16.9 million in fiscal 2008 from $20.5 million in fiscal 2007. In fiscal 2008, our effective tax rate was 29.4% compared to 38.9% in fiscal 2007. The reduction in the effective tax rate in fiscal 2008 resulted from the decrease in the Canadian corporate tax rate from 35% to 32% as well as the release of the valuation against U.S. loss carryforwards. Net Income Net income increased $8.5 million, or 28%, to $39.4 million in fiscal 2008 from $30.8 million in fiscal 2007. The increase in net income of $8.5 million in fiscal 2008 was a result of an increase in gross profit of $34.1 million resulting from sales from additional corporate-owned stores opened and an increase of $3.5 million in provision for income taxes, offset by increases in selling, general and administrative expenses of $24.7 million and a $4.4 million provision for impairment and lease exit costs. Comparison of Fiscal 2007 to Fiscal 2006 Net Revenue Net revenue increased $122.0 million, or 82%, to $269.9 million in fiscal 2007 from $148.0 million in fiscal 2006. This increase was primarily the result of increased comparable store sales, sales from new stores opened, and the strengthening of the average exchange rate for the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar during the period. Assuming the average exchange rate between the Canadian and United States dollars in fiscal 2006 remained constant, our net revenue would have increased $104.5 million, or 71%, in fiscal 2007. Fiscal Year Ended February 3, January 31, 2008 2007 (In thousands) Net revenue by segment: Corporate-owned stores $ 240,441 $ 119,812 Franchises 18,141 21,360 Other 11,360 6,792 Total net revenue $ 269,942 $ 147,964 Corporate-Owned Stores. Net revenue from our corporate-owned stores segment increased $120.6 million, or 101%, to $240.4 million in fiscal 2007 from $119.8 million in fiscal 2006. The following contributed to the $120.6 million increase in net revenue from our corporate-owned stores segment: • Comparable store sales growth of 34% in fiscal 2007 contributed $39.6 million, or 32%, of the increase. Assuming the average exchange rate between the Canadian and U.S. dollar in fiscal 2006 remained constant, our comparable store sales would have increased 24% in fiscal 2007 and contributed $28.6 million, or 23%, of the increase. The increase in comparable store sales was driven primarily by the strength of our existing 38 Table of Contents product lines, successful introduction of new products and increasing recognition of the lululemon athletica brand name; • New stores opened during fiscal 2007 contributed $29.8 million, or 24.3%, of the increase. During fiscal 2007, we opened 26 corporate-owned stores, consisting of five in Canada and 21 in the United States; • New stores opened during fiscal 2006 prior to sales from such stores becoming part of our comparable store sales base contributed $28.1 million, or 22.9%, of the increase. This consisted of five stores in Canada and five stores in the United States; • The acquisition of three Calgary franchise stores in April 2007 contributed $22.8 million, or 18.6%, of the increase; and • The inclusion of three additional days in our fiscal year in order to align our year-end to a 52/53 week fiscal year contributed an additional $2.5 million. Franchises. Net revenue from our franchises segment decreased $3.3 million, or 15%, to $18.1 million in fiscal 2007 from $21.4 million in fiscal 2006. The decrease in net revenue from our franchises segment consisted primarily of franchises net revenue of $9.7 million that shifted to corporate-owned stores net revenue when we acquired three franchise stores in Calgary. This was partially offset by increased franchise revenue of $6.5 million from our remaining franchise locations and one new franchise location in the United States and one new location in Australia. Other. Net revenue from our other segment increased $4.6 million, or 67%, to $11.4 million in fiscal 2007 from $6.8 million in fiscal 2006. The following contributed to the $4.6 million increase in net revenue from our other segment: • new and existing wholesale accounts contributed $1.7 million of the increase; • showroom sales revenue increased $1.7 million; • phone sale revenue accounted for $0.6 million of the increase; and • warehouse sales revenue increased $0.6 million. Gross Profit Gross profit increased $69.2 million, or 91%, to $144.9 million in fiscal 2007 from $75.7 million in fiscal 2006. The increase in gross profit was driven principally by: • an increase of $120.6 million in net revenue from our corporate-owned stores segment; and • an increase of $4.6 million in net revenue from our other segment. This amount was partially offset by: • an increase in product costs of $37.9 million associated with our sale of goods through corporate-owned stores, franchises and other segments; • an increase in occupancy costs of $7.6 million related to an increase in corporate-owned stores; • a decrease in franchise revenue of $3.3 million primarily related to our acquisition of three franchise locations in Calgary; • an increase in depreciation of $3.1 million primarily related to an increase in the number of corporate-owned stores; • an increase of $2.9 million in expenses related to our production, design and merchandising departments; • an increase of $2.0 million in expenses related to distribution costs as a result of increased production to support our growth. 39 Table of Contents Gross profit as a percentage of net revenue, or gross margin, increased 2.5%, to 53.7% in fiscal 2007 from 51.2% in fiscal 2006. The increase in gross margin resulted from: • a reduction in product costs as a percentage of net revenue that contributed to an increase in gross margin of 1.8%, primarily related to our acquisition of three franchise stores in Calgary; • a decrease in expenses related to our production, design and distribution departments (including stock-based compensation expense) as a percentage of net revenue in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006, which contributed to an increase in gross margin of 0.7%; and • a decrease in occupancy costs as a percentage of net revenue that contributed to an increase in gross margin of 0.1%. This amount was partially offset by an increase in store depreciation expense as a percentage of net revenue in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 as a result of new store openings in new markets, which contributed to a decrease in gross margin of 0.2%. Our costs of goods sold in fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006 included $0.7 million and $0.4 million, respectively, of stock-based compensation expense. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $41.6 million, or 80%, to $93.4 million in fiscal 2007 from $51.9 million in fiscal 2006. As a percentage of net revenue, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 0.5%, to 34.6%, in 2007 from 35.1% in 2006. Of the $41.6 million increase in selling, general and administrative expenses: • $17.1 million resulted from an increase in store employee compensation related to opening additional corporate-owned stores; • $7.4 million resulted from an increase in corporate compensation principally due to hiring of additional employees to support our growth; • $13.5 million resulted from an increase in other operating expenses primarily related to an increase of $4.0 million in distribution costs, $1.7 million in credit card fees, $1.5 million in supplies, $1.2 million in packaging costs, $1.8 million in marketing costs, $1.0 million in repairs and maintenance $1.0 million in miscellaneous expense, $0.7 million in communications costs, $0.3 million in insurance costs and $0.2 million in meals and entertainment; • $2.9 million resulted from an increase in stock-based compensation expense; • $1.4 million resulted from an increase in other operating expenses such as travel expenses and rent associated with corporate facilities; and • a foreign exchange loss of $0.7 million. This amount was partially offset by a decrease in professional fees of $1.4 million. Our selling, general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006 included $5.2 million and $2.5 million, respectively, of stock-based compensation expense. Income from Operations Income from operations increased $35.0 million, or 210%, to $51.6 million in fiscal 2007 from $16.6 million in fiscal 2006. The increase of $35.0 million in income from operations for fiscal 2007 was primarily due to a $69.2 million increase in gross profit resulting from increased comparable store sales and additional sales from corporate-owned stores opened during fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2007, the settlement of a lawsuit in fiscal 2006 of $7.2 million, and partially offset by an increase of $41.6 million in selling, general and administrative expenses. 40 Table of Contents On a segment basis, we determine income from operations without taking into account our general corporate expenses such as corporate employee costs, travel expenses and corporate rent. For purposes of our management’s analysis of our financial results, we have allocated some general product expenses to our corporate-owned stores segment. For example, all expenses related to our production, design, merchandise and distribution departments have been allocated to this segment. Income from operations (before general corporate expenses) from: • our corporate-owned stores segment increased $42.4 million, or 113%, to $79.8 million for fiscal 2007 from $37.4 million for fiscal 2006 primarily due to an increase in corporate-owned stores gross profit of $68.5 million, offset by an increase of $17.1 million in store employee expenses and an increase of $9.0 million in other store expenses; • our franchises segment decreased $1.9 million, or 18%, to $8.8 million in fiscal 2007 from $10.7 million in fiscal 2006 primarily as a result of franchises income from operations of $4.5 million included in the comparative period shifting to corporate-owned stores income from operations when we acquired three franchise stores in Calgary, partially offset by increased franchise income from operations of $2.6 million from our remaining franchise locations; and • our other segment increased $2.9 million, or 108%, to $5.6 million in fiscal 2007 from $2.7 million in fiscal 2006 primarily due to an increase in revenue of $4.6 million, offset by an increase of $3.0 million in product costs. Income from operations also includes general corporate expenses. General corporate expenses increased $10.3 million, or 32%, to $42.7 million in fiscal 2007 from $32.4 million in fiscal 2006 primarily due to an increase in corporate employee costs of $6.0 million, an increase in depreciation and amortization expense of $0.6 million, and an increase in other corporate expenses of $1.4 million, partially offset by a $1.4 million decrease in professional fees. Other Income, net Interest income increased $1.0 million, to $1.2 million in fiscal 2007 from $0.2 million in fiscal 2006 due to higher average cash balances. Interest expense increased $0.1 million, to $0.2 million in fiscal 2007 from $0.1 million in fiscal 2006 due to higher average borrowings on our line of credit. Provision for Income Taxes Provision for income taxes increased $11.7 million, to $20.5 million in fiscal 2007 from $8.8 million in fiscal 2006. In fiscal 2007, our effective tax rate was 38.9% compared to 52.3% in fiscal 2006. In both fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2007, we generated losses in the United States which we were unable to offset against our income in Canada for tax purposes. In fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2007, we also incurred stock-based compensation expenses of $2.6 million and $5.9 million, respectively, a portion of which were not deductible for tax purposes during these periods. Net Income Net income increased $23.2 million, to $30.8 million in fiscal 2007 from $7.7 million in fiscal 2006. The increase in net income of $23.2 million in fiscal 2007 was a result of an increase in gross profit of $69.2 million resulting from increased comparable store sales, additional sales from corporate-owned stores opened and the strengthening of the average rate for the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar during the period and the settlement of a lawsuit in fiscal 2006 of $7.2 million, offset by increases in selling, general and administrative expenses of $41.5 million and an increase of $11.7 million in provision for income taxes. 41 Table of Contents Seasonality In fiscal 2008, fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006, we recognized a significant amount of our net revenue in the fourth quarter due to significant increases in sales during the holiday season. We recognized 29%, 39% and 35% of our full year gross profit in the fourth quarter in fiscal 2008, fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006, respectively. Despite the fact that we have experienced a significant amount of our net revenue and gross profit in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year, we believe that the true extent of the seasonality or cyclical nature of our business may have been overshadowed by our rapid growth to date. The level of our working capital reflects the seasonality of our business. We expect inventory, accounts payable and accrued expenses to be higher in the third and fourth quarters in preparation for the holiday selling season. Because our products are sold primarily through our stores, order backlog is not material to our business. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our cash requirements are principally for working capital and capital expenditures, principally the build-out cost of new stores, renovations of existing stores, and improvements to our distribution facility and corporate infrastructure. Our need for working capital is seasonal, with the greatest requirements from August through the end of November each year as a result of our inventory build-up during this period for our holiday selling season. Historically, our main sources of liquidity have been cash flow from operating activities, borrowings under our existing and previous revolving credit facilities, and proceeds from equity offerings, including our initial public offering. As of February 1, 2009, our working capital (excluding cash and cash equivalents) was $14.9 million and our cash and cash equivalents was $56.8 million. The following table summarizes our net cash flows provided by and used in operating, investing and financing activities for the periods indicated: Fiscal Year Ended February 1, February 3, January 31, 2009 2008 2007 (In thousands) Total cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 46,443 $ 36,481 $ 25,449 Investing activities (46,795 ) (35,235 ) (13,350 ) Financing activities 13,461 31,412 669 Effect of exchange rate changes (8,857 ) 4,393 (616 ) Increase in cash and cash equivalents $ 4,252 $ 37,051 $ 12,152 Operating Activities Operating Activities consist primarily of net income adjusted for certain non-cash items, including depreciation and amortization, deferred income taxes, realized gains and losses on property and equipment, stock-based compensation expense and the effect of the changes in non-cash working capital items, principally accounts receivable, inventories, accounts payable and accrued expenses. In fiscal 2008, cash provided by operating activities increased $10.0 million, to $46.4 million compared to cash provided by operating activities of $36.5 million in fiscal 2007. The $10.0 million increase was primarily a result of increased net income as we expanded our store base and a net decrease in the change in other working capital balances, partially offset by a decrease in items not affecting cash. The net decrease in the change in other working capital balances was primarily due to an increase in accrued liabilities resulting from a provision for impairment and lease exit costs and was partially offset by an increase in the change in inventories as we build up spring and summer inventories for a larger store base. The decrease in items not affecting cash was primarily due to decreases in excess 42 Table of Contents tax benefits from stock-based compensation and deferred income taxes, and was partially offset by an increase in depreciation and amortization related to our increased store base. Depreciation and amortization relate almost entirely to leasehold improvements, furniture and fixtures, computer hardware and software, equipment and vehicles in our stores and other corporate buildings. Depreciation and amortization increased $7.5 million to $15.8 million in fiscal 2008 from $8.2 million in fiscal 2007. Depreciation for our corporate-owned store segment was $10.6 million, $6.1 million and $3.1 million in fiscal 2008, fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006, respectively. Depreciation related to corporate activities was $5.3 million, $2.1 million and $1.1 million in fiscal 2008, fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006, respectively. We have not allocated any depreciation to our franchises or other segments as these amounts to date have been immaterial. Investing Activities Investing Activities relate entirely to capital expenditures, investments in and advances to franchises, and acquisitions of franchised stores. Cash used in investing activities increased $11.6 million, to $46.8 million in fiscal 2008 from $35.2 million in fiscal 2007. This increase in cash used in investing activities represents an increase in the number of new stores as well as store improvements on a larger store base. Capital expenditures for our corporate-owned stores segment were $30.1 million in fiscal 2008 which included $27.0 million to open 34 corporate-owned stores (not including three acquired franchise stores), and $20.7 million in fiscal 2007, which included $17.0 million to open 28 stores (not including three acquired franchise store). The remaining capital expenditures for our corporate-owned stores segment in each period were for ongoing store refurbishment. Capital expenditures related to corporate activities and administration were $10.9 million and $9.3 million in fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007, respectively. The capital expenditures in each period for corporate activities and administration were for improvements at our head office and other corporate buildings as well as investments in information technology. There were no capital expenditures associated with our franchises and other segments. Investment in and advances to franchises are to LULULEMON ATHLETICA (AUSTRALIA) PTY LTD. In fiscal 2008, fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006, we purchased our franchises in Victoria, British Columbia and Bellevue, Washington for $3.4 million, Calgary, Alberta for $5.6 million and Portland, Oregon for $0.5 million, respectively. Capital expenditures are expected to range between $12.0 million to $13.0 million in fiscal 2009, including approximately $3.2 million for approximately six new stores, approximately $4.0 million for information technology enhancements and the remainder for ongoing store maintenance and for corporate activities. This does not include capital expenditures for our internet retail website which we expect to launch in early 2009. Financing Activities Financing Activities consist primarily of costs related to our initial public offering, cash received on the exercise of stock options and excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation. Cash provided by financing activities decreased $18.0 million, to $13.5 million in fiscal 2008 from $31.4 million in fiscal 2007. The decrease in cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to a decrease of $31.4 million in proceeds from our initial public offering, net of offering costs offset by an increase of excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation of $12.0 million and proceeds from exercise of stock options $1.4 million. We believe that our cash from operations, proceeds from our initial public offering and borrowings available to us under our revolving credit facility will be adequate to meet our liquidity needs and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 24 months. Our cash from operations may be negatively impacted by a decrease in demand for our products as well as the other factors described in “Risk Factors.” In addition, we may make discretionary capital improvements with respect to our stores, distribution facility, headquarters, or other systems, which we would expect to fund through the issuance of debt or equity securities or other external financing sources to the extent we were unable to fund such capital expenditures out of our cash from operations. 43 Table of Contents Revolving Credit Facility In April 2007, we entered into an uncommitted senior secured demand revolving credit facility with Royal Bank of Canada. The revolving credit facility provides us with available borrowings in an amount up to CDN$20.0 million. The revolving credit facility must be repaid in full on demand and is available by way of prime loans in Canadian currency, U.S. base rate loans in U.S. currency, bankers’ acceptances, LIBOR based loans in U.S. currency or Euro currency, letters of credit in Canadian currency or U.S. currency and letters of guaranty in Canadian currency or U.S. currency. The revolving credit facility bears interest on the outstanding balance in accordance with the following: (i) prime rate for prime loans; (ii) U.S. base rate for U.S. based loans; (iii) a fee of 1.125% per annum on bankers’ acceptances; (iv) LIBOR plus 1.125% per annum for LIBOR based loans; (v) a 1.125% annual fee for letters of credit; and (vi) a 1.125% annual fee for letters of guaranty. Both lululemon usa inc. and lululemon FC USA inc., Inc. provided Royal Bank of Canada with guarantees and postponements of claims in the amounts of CDN$20.0 million with respect to lululemon athletica canada inc.’s obligations under the revolving credit facility. The revolving credit facility is also secured by all of our present and after acquired personal property, including all intellectual property and all of the outstanding shares we own in our subsidiaries. As of February 1, 2009, aside from the letters of credit and guarantees, we had $nil in borrowings outstanding under this credit facility. Contractual Obligations and Commitments Leases. We lease certain corporate-owned store locations, storage spaces, building and equipment under non-cancelable operating leases. Our leases generally have initial terms of between five and 10 years, and generally can be extended only in five-year increments, if at all. Our leases expire at various dates between 2009 and 2019, excluding extensions at our option. A substantial number of our leases for corporate-owned store premises include renewal options and certain of our leases include rent escalation clauses, rent holidays and leasehold rental incentives, none of which are reflected in the following table. Most of our leases for corporate-owned store premises also include contingent rental payments based on sales volume, the impact of which also are not reflected in the following table. During the third quarter of fiscal 2008 we were released from our contractual obligation related to the new store support center head office location in Vancouver, British Columbia. The following table summarizes our contractual arrangements as of February 1, 2009, and the timing and effect that such commitments are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods: Payments Due by Year Ending Total 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Thereafter (In thousands) Operating Leases (minimum rent)* $ 211,598 $ 23,754 $ 24,439 $ 23,270 $ 23,624 $ 23,522 $ 92,989 * Includes $250, $250 and $270 for each of the years ending in 2010, 2011 and thereafter for one store lease which was terminated on May 15, 2007. Franchise Agreements. As of February 1, 2009, we operated five stores in North America and five stores in Australia through franchise agreements. Under the terms of our franchise agreements, unless otherwise approved by us, franchisees are permitted to sell only lululemon athletica products, are required to purchase their inventory from us, which we sell at a slight premium to our cost, and are required to pay us a royalty based on a percentage of their gross sales. Additionally, under some of our franchise agreements, we have the ability to repurchase franchises at a price equal to a specified percentage of trailing 12-month sales. During the year ended January 31, 2007, we and a franchisee mutually terminated our franchise agreement. The franchisee had commenced operations during the prior year. We paid the franchisee a negotiated amount of $527,590 that was recognized as a loss on the termination of the agreement and charged to selling, general and administrative expenses. The amount represented compensation for working capital that we abandoned and the return of the initial franchise fee of $10,000. 44 Table of Contents Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We enter into documentary letters of credit to facilitate the international purchase of merchandise. We also enter into standby letters of credit to secure certain of our obligations, including insurance programs and duties related to import purchases. As of February 1, 2009, letters of credit and letters of guarantee totaling $1.7 million have been issued. Other than these standby letters of credit, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, investments in special purpose entities or undisclosed borrowings or debt. In addition, we have not entered into any derivative contracts or synthetic leases. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions. Predicting future events is inherently an imprecise activity and, as such, requires the use of judgment. Actual results may vary from estimates in amounts that may be material to the financial statements. An accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically, could materially impact our consolidated financial statements. We believe that the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements: Revenue Recognition. Net revenue is comprised of corporate-owned store net revenue, which includes sales to customers through corporate-owned stores (including stores operated by our majority-owned joint venture), franchise licensing fees and royalties as well as sales of products to franchisees, and other net revenue, which includes sales to wholesale accounts, telephone sales, warehouse sales and sales from company-operated showrooms, in each case, less returns and discounts. Sales to customers through corporate-owned stores are recognized at the point of sale, net of an estimated allowance for sales returns. Franchise licensing fees and royalties are recognized when earned, in accordance with the terms of the franchise/license agreements. Royalties are based on a percentage of the franchisees’ sales and recognized when those sales occur. Franchise fee net revenue arising from the sale of a franchise is recognized when the agreement has been signed and all of our substantial obligations have been completed. Other net revenue, generated by sales to wholesale accounts, telephone sales, including related shipping and handling charges, and showroom sales are recognized when those sales occur, net of an estimated allowance for sales returns. Other net revenue related to warehouse sales are recognized when these sales occur. Amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling are recognized at the time of shipment. Sales are reported on a net revenue basis, which is computed by deducting from our gross sales the amount of sales taxes, actual product returns received, discounts and an amount established for anticipated sales returns. Our estimated allowance for sales returns is a subjective critical estimate that has a direct impact on reported net revenue. This allowance is calculated based on a history of actual returns, estimated future returns and any significant future known or anticipated events. Consideration of these factors results in an estimated allowance for sales returns. Our standard terms for retail sales limit returns to approximately 14 days after the sale of the merchandise. For our wholesale sales, we allow returns from our wholesale customers if properly requested and approved. Employee discounts are classified as a reduction of net revenue. We account for gift cards by recognizing a liability at the time a gift card is sold, and recognizing net revenue at the time the gift card is redeemed for merchandise. We review our gift card liability on an ongoing basis and recognize our estimate of the unredeemed gift card liability on a ratable basis over the estimated period of redemption. Accounts Receivable. Accounts receivable primarily arise out of sales to wholesale accounts, sales of products and royalties on sales owed to us by our franchises. The allowance for doubtful accounts represents management’s best estimate of probable credit losses in accounts receivable. This allowance is established based on the specific circumstances associated with the credit risk of the receivable, the size of the accounts receivable balance, aging of accounts receivable balances and our collection history and other relevant information. The 45 Table of Contents allowance for doubtful accounts is reviewed on a monthly basis. Receivables are charged to the allowance when management believes the account will not be recovered. Inventory. Inventory is valued at the lower of cost and market. Cost is determined using weighted-average costs. For finished goods and work-in-process, market is defined as net realizable value, and for raw materials, market is defined as replacement cost. Cost of inventories includes all costs incurred to deliver inventory to our distribution centers including freight, duty and other landing costs. During fiscal 2006, we initiated a new purchasing strategy that requires our manufacturers to acquire the raw materials used in the manufacturing of our apparel products. Because we will no longer be required to acquire these raw materials, we expect raw materials and work in process inventories to decline. We periodically review our inventories and make provisions as necessary to appropriately value obsolete or damaged goods. The amount of the markdown is equal to the difference between the book cost of the inventory and its estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demands, selling prices and market conditions. In fiscal 2008, we wrote-off $0.9 million of inventory and in fiscal 2007 we wrote-off $0.8 million of inventory. Property and Equipment. Property and equipment are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation. Costs related to software used for internal purposes are capitalized in accordance with the provisions of the Statement of Position 98-1, “Accounting for Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use” whereby direct internal and external costs incurred during the application development stage or for upgrades that add functionality are capitalized. All other costs related to internal use software are expensed as incurred. Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the lesser of the length of the lease, without consideration of option renewal periods and the estimated useful life of the assets, up to a maximum of five years. All other property and equipment are amortized using the declining balance method as follows: Furniture and fixtures 20 % Computer hardware and software 30 % Equipment and vehicles 30 % We account for asset retirement obligations under FASB Interpretation No. 47 (“FIN 47”), “Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations — an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143.” FIN 47 requires recognition of a liability for the fair value of a required asset retirement obligation (“ARO”) when such obligation is incurred. Our AROs are primarily associated with leasehold improvements which, at the end of a lease, we are contractually obligated to remove in order to comply with the lease agreement. At the inception of a lease with such conditions, we record an ARO liability and a corresponding capital asset in an amount equal to the estimated fair value of the obligation. The liability is estimated based on a number of assumptions requiring management’s judgment, including store closing costs, cost inflation rates and discount rates, and is accreted to its projected future value over time. The capitalized asset is depreciated using the convention for depreciation of leasehold improvement assets. Upon satisfaction of the ARO conditions, any difference between the recorded ARO liability and the actual retirement costs incurred is recognized as an operating gain or loss in the consolidated statements of earnings. Prior to fiscal 2008 these obligations were not material. We account for lease termination costs under FASB Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 146 (“SFAS 146”), “Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities.” SFAS 146 requires a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity to be recognized and measured initially at its fair value in the period in which the liability is incurred. We estimate fair value at the cease-use date of its operating leases as the remaining lease rentals, reduced by estimated sublease rentals that could be reasonably obtained for the property, even where we does not intend to enter into a sublease. Estimating the cost of certain lease exit costs involves subjective assumptions, including the time it would take to sublease the leased location and the related potential sublease income. The estimated accruals for these costs could be significantly affected if future experience differs from that used in the initial estimate. Lease exit costs are included in provision for impairment and lease exit costs. 46 Table of Contents Long-Lived Assets. Long-lived assets, including intangible assets with finite useful lives, held for use are evaluated for impairment when the occurrence of events or changes in circumstances indicates that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable as measured by comparing their net book value to the estimated future cash flows generated by their use and eventual disposition. Impaired assets are recorded at fair value, determined principally by discounting the future cash flows expected from their use and eventual disposition. Reductions in asset values resulting from impairment valuations are recognized in earnings in the period that the impairment is determined. Long-lived assets, including intangible assets with finite useful lives, held for sale are reported at the lower of the carrying value of the asset and fair value less cost to sell. Any write-downs to reflect fair value less selling cost is recognized in income when the asset is classified as held for sale. Gains or losses on assets held for sale and asset dispositions are included in provision for impairment and lease exit costs. Income Taxes. We follow the liability method with respect to accounting for income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates that will be in effect when these differences are expected to reverse. Deferred income tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance, if based on the weight of available positive and negative evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. On February 1, 2007 the Company adopted the provisions of Financial Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (“FIN 48”), which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a company’s financial statements in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement process for recording in the financial statements uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Additionally, FIN 48 provides guidance on the de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, and disclosure requirements for uncertain tax positions. The recognition of a deferred income tax asset is based upon several assumptions and management forecasts, including current and proposed tax legislation, current and anticipated taxable income, utilization of previously unrealized non-operating loss carry forwards and regulatory reviews of tax filings. Given the judgments and estimates required and the sensitivity of the results to the significant assumptions used, we believe the accounting estimates used in relation to the recognition of deferred income tax assets are subject to measurement uncertainty and are susceptible to a material change if the underlying assumptions change. We file income tax returns in the United States, Canada and various foreign and state jurisdictions. We are subject to income tax examination by tax authorities in all jurisdictions from our inception to date. Our policy is to recognize interest expense and penalties related to income tax matters as tax expense. At February 1, 2009, we do not have any significant accruals for interest related to unrecognized tax benefits or tax penalties. Our intercompany transfer pricing policies will be subject to audits by various foreign tax jurisdictions. Although we believe that our intercompany transfer pricing policies and tax positions are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits or potential tax disputes may be materially different from that which is reflected in our income tax provisions and accruals. Goodwill and Intangible Assets. Intangible assets are recorded at cost. Non-competition agreements are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life of five years. Reacquired franchise rights are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives of 10 years. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair market value of identifiable net assets acquired and is not amortized. Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested for impairment annually or more frequently when an event or circumstance indicates that goodwill or indefinite useful live intangible assets might be impaired. We use our best estimates and judgment based on available evidence in conducting the impairment testing. When the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess of the carrying value over its fair market value. Stock-Based Compensation. We account for stock-based compensation using the fair value method as required by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 — (Revised 2004), “Share Based Payments” (“SFAS 123(R)”). The fair value of awards granted is estimated at the date of grant and recognized as employee compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period with the offsetting credit to 47 Table of Contents additional paid-in capital. Our calculation of stock-based compensation requires us to make a number of complex and subjective estimates and assumptions, including future forfeitures, stock price volatility, expected life of the options and related tax effects. Prior to our initial public offering, our board of directors determined the estimated fair value of our common stock on the date of grant based on a number of factors, most significantly our implied enterprise value based upon the purchase price of our securities sold in December 2005 pursuant to an arms-length private placement to a group of private equity investors. The estimation of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment, and to the extent actual results differ from our estimates, such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised. We consider several factors when estimating expected forfeitures, such as types of awards, size of option holder group and anticipated employee retention. Actual results may differ substantially from these estimates. Expected volatility of the stock is based on our review of companies we believe of similar growth and maturity and our peer group in the industry in which we do business because we do not have sufficient historical volatility data for our own stock. The expected term of options granted is derived from the output of the option valuation model and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding. In the future, as we gain historical data for volatility in our own stock and the actual term employees hold our options, expected volatility and expected term may change which could substantially change the grant-date fair value of future awards of stock options and, ultimately, the expense we record. For awards with service and/or performance conditions, the total amount of compensation expense to be recognized is based on the number of awards that are expected to vest and is adjusted to reflect those awards that do ultimately vest. For awards with performance conditions, we recognize the compensation expense over the requisite service period as determined by a range of probability weighted outcomes. For awards with market and or performance conditions, all compensation expense is recognized if the underlying market or performance conditions are fulfilled. Certain employees are entitled to share-based awards from one of our stockholders. These awards are accounted for as employee compensation expense in accordance with the above noted policies. We commenced applying SFAS 123(R) when we introduced share based awards for our employees in the year ended January 31, 2006. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In February 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (“SFAS 159”). This Statement permits entities to choose to measure various financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected are reported in earnings. We adopted SFAS 159 on February 4, 2008 and did not elect the fair value option for any of its eligible financial assets or liabilities. In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (“SFAS 157”). SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with GAAP, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS 157 applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements and accordingly does not require any new fair value measurements. The provisions of SFAS 157 are to be applied prospectively as of the beginning of the fiscal year in which it is initially applied, with any transition adjustment recognized as a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings. The provisions of SFAS 157 are effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, however the FASB has delayed the effective date of SFAS 157 to fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008 for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities, except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis. The adoption of SFAS 157 for financial assets and liabilities in the first two quarters of fiscal 2008 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of SFAS 157 for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities on its financial position and results of operations. In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 141R, Business Combinations (revised 2007) (“SFAS 141R”). SFAS 141R replaces SFAS 141 and requires the acquirer of a business to recognize and measure the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any non-controlling interest in the acquiree at fair value. SFAS 141R also requires transaction costs related to the business combination to be expensed as incurred. SFAS 141R is effective for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. We do not believe the adoption of SFAS 141R will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 48 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates. Our market risk exposure is primarily a result of fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. We do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. Foreign Currency Exchange Risk. We currently generate a majority of our net revenue in Canada. The reporting currency for our consolidated financial statements is the U.S. dollar. Historically, our operations were based largely in Canada. As of February 1, 2009, we operated 42 stores in Canada. As a result, we have been impacted by changes in exchange rates and may be impacted materially for the foreseeable future. As we recognize net revenue from sales in Canada in Canadian dollars, and the U.S. dollar has strengthened during fiscal 2008, it has had a negative impact on our Canadian operating results upon translation of those results into U.S. dollars for the purposes of consolidation. However, the loss in net revenue was partially offset by lower cost of sales and lower selling, general and administrative expenses that are generated in Canadian dollars. The 2% depreciation in the relative value of the U.S. dollar compared to the Canadian dollar in fiscal 2008 versus fiscal 2007 has resulted in lost income from operations of approximately $3.7 million for fiscal 2008. To the extent the ratio between our net revenue generated in Canadian dollars increases as compared to our expenses generated in Canadian dollars, we expect that our results of operations will be further impacted by changes in exchange rates. We do not currently hedge foreign currency fluctuations. However, in the future, in an effort to mitigate losses associated with these risks, we may at times enter into derivative financial instruments, although we have not historically done so. We do not, and do not intend to, engage in the practice of trading derivative securities for profit. Interest Rate Risk. In April 2007, we entered into an uncommitted senior secured demand revolving credit facility with Royal Bank of Canada. The revolving credit facility provides us with available borrowings in an amount up to CDN$20.0 million. Because our revolving credit facility bears interest at a variable rate, we will be exposed to market risks relating to changes in interest rates, if we have a meaningful outstanding balance. As of February 1, 2009, we had no outstanding borrowings under our revolving facility. We had small outstanding balances under our revolving facility during fiscal 2008 as we built inventory and working capital for the holiday selling season, but we do not believe we are significantly exposed to changes in interest rate risk. We currently do not engage in any interest rate hedging activity and currently have no intention to do so in the foreseeable future. However, in the future, if we have a meaningful outstanding balance under our revolving facility, in an effort to mitigate losses associated with these risks, we may at times enter into derivative financial instruments, although we have not historically done so. These may take the form of forward sales contracts, option contracts, and interest rate swaps. We do not, and do not intend to, engage in the practice of trading derivative securities for profit. Inflation Inflationary factors such as increases in the cost of our product and overhead costs may adversely affect our operating results. Although we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations to date, a high rate of inflation in the future may have an adverse effect on our ability to maintain current levels of gross margin and selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenue if the selling prices of our products do not increase with these increased costs. 49 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 21:53:32.771973

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS This discussion summarizes our consolidated operating results, financial condition and liquidity during the three-year period ending January 31, 2010. Our fiscal year ends on the Sunday closest to January 31 of the following year, typically resulting in a 52 week year, but occasionally giving rise to an additional week, resulting in a 53 week year. Fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007 ended on January 31, 2010, February 1, 2009 and February 3, 2008, respectively. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K. This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements based on current expectations that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions, such as our plans, objectives, expectations and intentions set forth in the “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.” Our actual results and the timing of events may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth in the “Item 1A — Risk Factors” section and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Overview The world economy and capital markets are continuing to experience the effects of unprecedented volatility. During fiscal 2008, there was a considerable slow down as problems in global financial markets became more widespread and consumers cut back on retail spending amid fears of a global recession. Our sales growth slowed in the latter part of fiscal 2008, driven in part by this reduced spending. This challenging economic climate and the continued weakness of the Canadian dollar continued to negatively affect our financial results during the beginning of fiscal 2009. Recently, the global economy has shown some signs of improvement, as reflected in our current quarter net revenue growth, and the Canadian dollar has strengthened relative to the United States dollar. This growth however, does not match the rapid growth we realized in prior years. Management recognizes the difficult economic situation that many of our consumers are still facing and does not expect our rate of growth to change significantly in the next fiscal year. In response to the changes in the world economy and the impact on our operating results, we have taken several steps to address the deterioration in the retail environment and to address our support structure. These steps, which we discussed in our annual report on Form 10-K for fiscal 2008 filed with the SEC on March 27, 2009, included the development and implementation of several important initiatives as part of our strategy designed to increase customer traffic in our corporate-owned store locations, reduce infrastructure expenses and improve our operating results. We continue to realize the positive effects of our cost reductions and efficiency initiatives, and expect that such initiatives, combined with modest net revenue growth, will continue to impact our financial results during fiscal 2010. These targeted cost reductions and associated efficiency efforts were designed to structure our business for long-term profitable growth and to protect our brand integrity. We believe our continued strong cash flow generation, solid balance sheet and healthy liquidity provide us with the financial flexibility to continue executing the initiatives we implemented at the end of fiscal 2008, as well as make investments at strategic times going forward which will benefit our company. Operating Segment Overview lululemon is a designer and retailer of technical athletic apparel operating primarily in North America. Our yoga-inspired apparel is primarily marketed under the lululemon athletica brand name. We offer a comprehensive line of apparel and accessories including fitness pants, shorts, tops and jackets designed for athletic pursuits such as yoga, running and general fitness. As of January 31, 2010, our branded apparel was principally sold through 124 corporate-owned and franchise stores that are primarily located in Canada and the United States and via our retail website through our direct to consumers sales channel. We believe our vertical retail strategy allows us to interact more directly with and gain insights from our customers while providing us with greater control of our brand. In fiscal 2009, 59.9% of our net revenue was derived from sales of our products in Canada, 40.0% of our net revenue was derived from the sales of our products in the United States and an immaterial amount of our net revenue was derived from sales of our products outside of North America. In fiscal 2008, 68.9% of our net revenue was derived 28 Table of Contents from sales of our products in Canada, 31.1% of our net revenue was derived from the sales of our products in the United States and an immaterial amount of our net revenue was derived from sales of our products outside of North America. In fiscal 2007, 80.3% of our net revenue was derived from sales of our products in Canada, 19.7% of our net revenue was derived from the sales of our products in the United States and an immaterial amount of our net revenue was derived from sales of our products outside of North America. Our net revenue has grown from $40.7 million in fiscal 2004 to $452.9 million in fiscal 2009. This represents a compound net annual growth rate of 61.9%. Our net revenue from continuing operations also increased from $353.5 million in fiscal 2008 to $452.9 million in fiscal 2009, representing a 28.1% increase. Our increase in net revenue from fiscal 2004 to fiscal 2009 resulted from the net addition of seven retail locations and our e-commerce sales channel in fiscal 2009, 35 retail locations in fiscal 2008, 31 retail locations in fiscal 2007, 14 retail locations in fiscal 2006 and 17 retail locations in fiscal 2005, and comparable store sales growth of 9%, 0%, 34% and 25% in fiscal 2009, fiscal 2008, fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006, respectively. Our ability to open new stores and grow sales in existing stores has been driven by increasing demand for our technical athletic apparel and a growing recognition of the lululemon athletica brand. We believe our superior products, strategic store locations, inviting store environment, grassroots marketing approach and distinctive corporate culture are responsible for our strong financial performance. We have recently increased our focus on our men’s apparel line, net revenue from which increased 30% in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 and represented approximately 12.1% of net revenue in fiscal 2009 versus 11.5% of net revenue in fiscal 2008, and our accessories line, which also increased in proportion to net revenue in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008. We have three reportable segments: corporate-owned stores, franchises and other. We report our segments based on the financial information we use in managing our businesses. While we receive financial information for each corporate-owned store, we have aggregated all of the corporate-owned stores into one reportable segment due to the similarities in the economic and other characteristics of these stores. Our franchises segment accounted for 3.2% of our net revenues from continuing operations in fiscal 2009, 4.6% in fiscal 2008 and 6.7% in fiscal 2007. Opening new franchise stores is not a significant part of our near-term growth strategy, and we therefore expect that if the revenue derived from our franchise stores continues to comprise less than 10% of the net revenue we report in future fiscal years. Our other operations, consisting of direct to consumer sales, wholesale accounts, warehouse sales and sales from company-operated showrooms, accounted for less than 10% of our net revenues from continuing operations in each of fiscal 2009, fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007. We will re-evaluate our segment reporting disclosures in fiscal 2010. As of January 31, 2010, we sold our products through 110 corporate-owned stores located in Canada and the United States. As previously disclosed, we discontinued our operations in Japan. We plan to increase our net revenue in North America by opening additional corporate-owned stores in new and existing markets. Corporate-owned stores net revenue accounted for 86.9% of total net revenue in fiscal 2009 and 89.3% of total net revenue in fiscal 2008. As of January 31, 2010, we also had five franchise stores located in North America and nine franchise stores located in Australia. In the past, we have entered into franchise agreements to distribute lululemon athletica branded products to more quickly disseminate our brand name and increase our net revenue and net income. In exchange for the use of our brand name and the ability to operate lululemon athletica stores in certain regions, our franchisees generally pay us a one-time franchise fee and ongoing royalties based on their gross revenue. Additionally, unless otherwise approved by us, our franchisees are required to sell only lululemon athletica branded products, which are purchased from us at a discount to the suggested retail price. Pursuing new franchise partnerships or opening new franchise stores is not a significant part of our near-term store growth strategy. In some cases, we may exercise our contractual rights to purchase franchises where it is attractive to us. We believe that our athletic apparel has and will continue to appeal to consumers outside of North America who value its technical attributes as well as its function and style. In 2004, we opened our first franchise store in Australia. During fiscal 2008 we invested in NEW HARBOUR YOGA PTY LTD. (formerly known as lululemon athletica (australia) pty ltd.) which operates nine franchise stores. In 2005, we opened a franchise store in Japan. In 2006, we terminated our franchise arrangement and entered into a joint venture agreement with Japanese apparel 29 Table of Contents company Descente Ltd, or Descente, a global leader in fabric technology, to operate our stores in Japan, which were discontinued in fiscal 2008. In addition to deriving revenue from sales through our corporate-owned stores and our franchises, we also derive other net revenue, which includes the sale of our products direct to consumers through our e-commerce and phone sales channels, as well as wholesale customers, including related shipping and handling charges, warehouse sales and sales through a number of company-operated showrooms. E-commerce sales are taken directly from retail customers through www.lululemon.com. Wholesale customers include select premium yoga studios, health clubs and fitness centers. Phone sales are taken directly from retail customers through our call center. Warehouse sales are typically held one or more times a year to sell slow moving inventory or inventory from prior seasons to retail customers at discounted prices. Our showrooms are typically small locations that we open from time to time when we enter new markets and feature a limited selection of our product offering during select hours. Other net revenue accounted for 9.9% of total net revenue in fiscal 2009 and 6.1% of total net revenue in fiscal 2008. Basis of Presentation Net revenue is comprised of: • corporate-owned store net revenue, which includes sales to customers through corporate-owned stores; • franchises net revenue, which consists of licensing fees and royalties as well as sales of our products to franchises; and • other net revenue, which includes direct to consumer sales, wholesale accounts, warehouse sales and sales from company-operated showrooms. in each case, net of an estimated allowance for sales returns and discounts. In addition, we separately track comparable store sales, which reflect net revenue at corporate-owned stores that have been open for at least 12 months. Therefore, net revenue from a store is included in comparable store sales beginning with the first month for which the store has a full month of comparable prior year sales. Non-comparable store sales include sales from new stores that have not been open for 12 months, sales from franchises, direct to consumer sales, wholesale and showrooms, and sales from corporate-owned stores which we have closed. By measuring the change in year-over-year net revenue in stores that have been open for 12 months or more, comparable store sales allows us to evaluate how our core store base is performing. Various factors affect comparable store sales, including: • the location of new stores relative to existing stores; • consumer preferences, buying trends and overall economic trends; • our ability to anticipate and respond effectively to customer preferences for technical athletic apparel; • competition; • changes in our merchandise mix; • pricing; • the timing of our releases of new merchandise and promotional events; • the effectiveness of our grassroots marketing efforts; • the level of customer service that we provide in our stores; • our ability to source and distribute products efficiently; and • the number of stores we open, close (including for temporary renovations) and expand in any period. Opening new stores is an important part of our growth strategy. Accordingly, comparable store sales has limited utility for assessing the success of our growth strategy insofar as comparable store sales do not reflect the performance of stores open less than 12 months. 30 Table of Contents Cost of goods sold includes: • the cost of purchased merchandise, inbound freight, duty and non-refundable taxes incurred in delivering goods to our distribution centers; • the cost of our distribution centers (such as rent and utilities) as well as other fees we pay to third parties to operate our distribution centers and the depreciation and amortization related to our distribution centers; • the cost of our production, merchandise and design departments including salaries, stock-based compensation and benefits, and operating expenses; • the cost of occupancy related to store operations (such as rent and utilities) and the depreciation and amortization related to store-level capital expenditures; • hemming; and • shrink and valuation reserves. Cost of goods sold also may change as we open or close stores because of the resulting change in related occupancy costs. The primary drivers of the costs of individual goods are the costs of raw materials and labor in the countries where we source our merchandise. Selling, general and administrative expenses consist of all operating costs not otherwise included in cost of goods sold and provision for impairment and lease exit costs. Our selling, general and administrative expenses include marketing costs, accounting costs, information technology costs, professional fees, corporate facility costs, corporate and store-level payroll and benefits expenses, and depreciation and amortization expense for all assets other than depreciation and amortization expenses related to store-level capital expenditures and our distribution centers, each of which are included in cost of goods sold. We anticipate that our selling, general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars due to anticipated continued growth of our corporate support staff and store-level employees. Provision for impairment and lease exit costs consists of asset impairments, lease exit and other related costs associated with the closure of one US corporate-owned store in the first quarter of fiscal 2009 and one US corporate-owned store in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 as well as an asset impairment provision based on management’s ongoing evaluation of its portfolio of corporate-owned store locations. Long-lived assets are reviewed at the store-level periodically for impairment or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that full recoverability of net assets through future cash flows is in question. Factors used in the evaluation include, but are not limited to, management’s plans for future operations, recent operating results and projected cash flows. Stock-based compensation expense includes charges incurred in recognition of compensation expense associated with grants of stock options and grants of restricted stock units. We recognize stock-based compensation expense for both awards granted by us and awards granted under a stockholder sponsored plan. Stock-based compensation expense is measured at the grant date, based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as an expense over the requisite service period. Prior to our initial public offering in July 2007, the fair value of the shares of common stock that underlie the stock options we granted was determined by our board of directors. Our board of directors determined a valuation of lululemon as of April 30, 2006. The valuation was calculated based upon the equity value implied by the December 2005 transaction in which Mr. Wilson sold 48% of his interest in lululemon to a group of private equity investors for approximately $193.3 million. At the time, our board of directors believed the December 2005 transaction was a valid indication of fair value because the terms of the December 2005 transaction were the result of arms-length negotiations among independent parties. Because there had been no public market for our common stock, our board used this valuation to determine the fair value of our common stock at the time of grant of the options. In connection with the preparation of the financial statements necessary for our initial public offering and based in part on discussions with prospective underwriters for the planned offering, in March 2007 we reassessed the estimated accounting fair value as of January 2007 of common stock in light of the potential completion of the initial public offering. After reviewing its valuation, our board of directors determined that the valuation would not be appropriate for valuing the options as the valuation did not fully consider requirements under FASB ASC Topic 31 Table of Contents 718 “Compensation — Stock Compensation” (which codified former Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123(R) “Share-Based Payments”) and other relevant regulatory guidelines, specifically: • the valuation did not coincide with the option grant dates; and • the valuation incorrectly included a minority interest discount. As a result, management determined that it would be necessary to retrospectively calculate a new valuation for the July 2006 option grants. Based upon the reassessment, we determined that the accounting fair value of the options granted to employees from February 1, 2006 to January 31, 2007 was greater than the exercise price for certain of those options. The comparison of the originally determined fair value and reassessed fair value is as follows for all dates on which an option was granted, assuming that our corporate reorganization had occurred and using the initial public offering price of $18.00 per share: Weighted- Weghted- Initial Original Average Number of Average Public Fair Value Reassessed Options Exercise Offering Assessment Fair Value Grant Date Granted Price Price of Options of Options July 3, 2006 2,899,186 $ 0.58 $ 18.00 $ 0.33 $ 0.91 December 6, 2006 5,955 $ 0.58 $ 18.00 $ 0.33 $ 8.09 December 27, 2006 1,309,008 $ 0.58 $ 18.00 $ 0.33 $ 8.09 January 3, 2007 357,335 $ 0.58 $ 18.00 $ 0.33 $ 8.09 Based upon the reassessment discussed above, we determined the reassessed accounting fair value of the options to purchase 4,571,484 shares of common stock granted to employees during the period from February 1, 2006 to January 31, 2007 ranged from a weighted-average price of $0.91 to $8.09 per share. As a result of the reassessed fair value of our grants of stock options, the aggregate fair value of our stock options increased by $14.6 million. There are significant judgments and estimates inherent in the determination of the reassessed accounting fair values. For this and other reasons, the reassessed accounting fair value used to compute the stock-based compensation expense may not be reflective of the fair market value that would result from the application of other valuation methods, including accepted valuation methods for tax purposes. We record our stock-based compensation expense in cost of goods sold and selling, general and administrative expenses as stock-based awards have been made to employees whose salaries are classified in both expense categories. Other income (expense), net includes interest earned on our cash balances and our advances to franchise, interest costs associated with our credit facilities and with letters of credit drawn under these facilities for the purchase of merchandise and our share of the operations of our investment in NEW HARBOUR YOGA PTY LTD. (the Australian franchise operator). We expect to continue to generate interest income to the extent that our cash generated from operations exceeds our cash used for investment. We have maintained relatively small outstanding balances on our credit facilities and expect to continue to do so. Provision for income taxes depends on the statutory tax rates in the countries where we sell our products. Historically we have generated taxable income in Canada and we have generated tax losses in the United States. For periods up to and including the second quarter of fiscal 2007, we recorded a full valuation allowance against our losses in the United States. In the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2007, we earned taxable income in the United States. During the second quarter of fiscal 2008, after considering a number of factors, including recent taxable income, utilization of previously unrealized net operating losses, or NOLs, our growth strategy as well as other business and macroeconomic factors, we determined that we would more likely than not realize the benefit of deferred tax assets through future taxable income. We have recorded deferred tax assets in respect of foreign tax credits and other deductible temporary differences of $15.1 million as at January 31, 2010. Several factors have contributed to our effective tax rate fluctuating in recent periods. First, in fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007, we generated losses in the United States which we were unable to offset against our income in Canada. 32 Table of Contents Second, we incurred stock-based compensation expense of $5.6 million, $6.5 million and $5.9 million in fiscal 2009, fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007, respectively, a portion of which were not deductible for tax purposes in Canada and the United States during these periods. Third, the Canadian corporate tax rate decrease in fiscal 2008 from 35% to 32%. Fourth, in fiscal 2008 we began to release the valuation against US loss carry forwards. Our effective tax rate in fiscal 2009 was 32.8%, compared to 29.4% in fiscal 2008, and 38.9% in fiscal 2007. We anticipate that in the future we may start to sell our products directly to some customers located outside of Canada, the United States and Australia, in which case we would become subject to taxation based on the foreign statutory rates in the countries where these sales take place and our effective tax rate could fluctuate accordingly. Results of Operations The following tables summarize key components of our results of operations for the periods indicated, both in dollars and as a percentage of net revenue: Fiscal Year Ended January 31, February 1, February 3, 2010 2009 2008 (In thousands) Consolidated statements of operations: Net revenue $ 452,898 $ 353,488 $ 269,942 Cost of goods sold 229,812 174,421 125,015 Gross profit 223,086 179,067 144,927 Operating expenses: Selling, general and administrative expenses 136,161 118,098 93,376 Provision for impairment and lease exit costs 379 4,405 — Income from operations 86,546 56,564 51,551 Other income (expense), net 164 821 1,029 Income before provision for income taxes 86,710 57,385 52,580 Provision for income taxes 28,429 16,884 20,464 Net income from continuing operations 58,281 40,501 32,116 Net loss from discontinued operations — (1,138 ) (1,273 ) Net income $ 58,281 $ 39,363 $ 30,843 Fiscal Year Ended January 31, February 1, February 3, 2010 2009 2008 (% of net revenue) Net revenue 100.0 100.0 100.0 Cost of goods sold 50.7 49.3 46.3 Gross profit 49.3 50.7 53.7 Operating expenses: Selling, general and administrative expenses 30.1 33.4 34.6 Provision for impairment and lease exit costs 0.1 1.2 — Income from operations 19.1 16.0 19.1 Other income (expense), net 0.1 0.2 0.4 Income before provision for income taxes 19.2 16.2 19.5 Provision for income taxes 6.3 4.8 7.6 Net income from continuing operations 12.9 11.5 11.9 Net loss from discontinued operations — (0.3 ) (0.5 ) Net income 12.9 11.1 11.4 33 Table of Contents Comparison of Fiscal 2009 to Fiscal 2008 Net Revenue Net revenue increased $99.4 million, or 28%, to $452.9 million in fiscal 2009 from $353.5 million in fiscal 2008. This increase was primarily the result of increased sales at locations in our comparable stores base as well as sales from new stores opened. Assuming the average exchange rate between the Canadian and United States dollars in fiscal 2008 remained constant, our net revenue would have increased $103.0 million, or 29%, in fiscal 2009. The constant dollar increase in comparable store sales was driven primarily by the strength of our existing product lines, successful introduction of new products and increasing recognition of the lululemon athletica brand name. Fiscal Year Ended January 31, February 1, 2010 2009 (In thousands) Net revenue by segment: Corporate-owned stores $ 393,451 $ 315,548 Franchises 14,554 16,198 Other 44,893 21,742 Total net revenue $ 452,898 $ 353,488 Corporate-Owned Stores. Net revenue from our corporate-owned stores segment increased $77.9 million, or 25%, to $393.5 million in fiscal 2009 from $315.5 million in fiscal 2008. The following contributed to the $77.9 million increase in net revenue from our corporate-owned stores segment: • Net revenue from corporate-owned stores we opened during fiscal 2009, and during fiscal 2008 prior to sales from such stores becoming part of our comparable stores base, contributed $46.5 million of the increase. Net new store openings in fiscal 2009 included two stores in Canada and five stores in the United States; • Comparable store sales increase of 9% in fiscal 2009 resulted in a $26.6 million increase to net revenue, excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations. Including the effect of foreign currency fluctuations, comparable store sales increased 8%, or $24.1 million, in fiscal 2009; • Net revenue related to gift card breakage contributed $2.2 million of the increase. Based on historical gift card breakage, we recognize into revenue a portion of gift card sales for which we estimate redemption is remote over the estimated period of redemption. This includes a one-time credit of $1.3 million recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2009 related to a change in our estimated rate of redemption; and • The acquisition of two Victoria, British Columbia and one Bellevue, Washington franchise stores in September 2008 contributed $5.1 million before entering the comparative store base. Franchises. Net revenue from our franchises segment decreased $1.6 million, or 10%, to $14.6 million in fiscal 2009 from $16.2 million in fiscal 2008. The decrease in net revenue from our franchises segment consisted primarily of franchises net revenue of $2.2 million that shifted to corporate-owned stores net revenue when we acquired two franchise stores in Victoria, British Columbia and one franchise store in Bellevue, Washington. This was partially offset by increased franchise revenue of $0.6 million from our one remaining Canadian franchise location and four franchise locations in the United States. Opening new franchise stores is not a significant part of our near-term store growth strategy, and as such we expect net revenue from our franchises segment to continue to decrease in future years. Other. Net revenue from our other segment increased $23.2 million, or 106%, to $44.9 million in fiscal 2009 from $21.7 million in fiscal 2008. The following contributed to the $23.2 million increase in net revenue from our other segment: • an increase in sales from the launch of our e-commerce, which is included in our direct to consumer channel, in fiscal 2009 which contributed $16.8 million in net revenues; • an increase in outlet revenues of $5.0 million due to existing outlet locations increase of $3.2 million and two new outlet locations opened in fiscal 2009 which contributed sales revenue of $1.8 million; 34 Table of Contents • new and existing wholesale accounts contributed $4.4 million of the increase; and • showroom sales revenue increased $1.6 million. The increase in net revenue from our other segment was offset by: • temporary store locations opened in fiscal 2008, which contributed $3.2 million, were not opened in fiscal 2009; • decreased warehouse revenue, due to fewer warehouse sales in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008, of $0.6 million; and • decreased phonesale revenue, which shifted to e-commerce, of $0.2 million. Gross Profit Gross profit increased $44.0 million, or 25%, to $223.1 million in fiscal 2009 from $179.1 million in fiscal 2008. The increase in gross profit was driven principally by: • an increase of $77.3 million in net revenue from our corporate-owned stores segment; and • an increase of $23.2 million in net revenue from our other segment. This amount was partially offset by: • an increase in product costs of $39.5 million associated with our sale of goods through corporate-owned stores, franchises and other segments; • an increase in occupancy costs of $8.5 million related to an increase in corporate-owned stores; • an increase in depreciation of $3.2 million primarily related to an increase in corporate-owned stores; • an increase of $1.8 million in expenses related to our production, design and merchandising departments; • an increase of $1.7 million in discounts, shrinkage and other as a result of increased sales volume; and • a decrease of $1.6 million in net revenue from our franchise segment. Gross profit, as a percentage of net revenue, or gross margin, decreased 1.4%, to 49.3% in fiscal 2009 from 50.7% in fiscal 2008. The decrease in gross margin resulted from: • unfavorable foreign exchange differences of 1.3% on product costs, depreciation, occupancy and production, design, merchandising and distribution departments as a result of the strengthening Canadian dollar; • a decrease in corporate-owned stores, franchise and other product margins, which contributed a decrease in gross margin of 0.6% as a result of increased direct product costs, markdowns and discounts; and • an increase in reduced write-downs and other of 0.1%. This was partially offset by a decrease in expenses related to our production, design, merchandising and distribution departments, relative to the increase in net revenue, which had a leveraging effect on gross margin and contributed an increase of 0.6%. Our costs of goods sold in fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008 included $0.8 million and $0.8 million, respectively, of stock-based compensation expense. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $18.0 million, or 15%, to $136.2 million in fiscal 2009 from $118.1 million in fiscal 2008. As a percentage of net revenue, selling, general and administrative expenses 35 Table of Contents decreased 3.3%, to 30.1%, in fiscal 2009 from 33.4% in fiscal 2008. Of the $18.0 million increase in selling, general and administrative expenses: • an increase in administrative costs related to our direct to consumer segment, primarily associated with the launch in fiscal 2009 of our new e-commerce website, of $5.6 million; • an increase of $3.8 million primarily associated with employment-related legal matters, professional fees and legal costs associated with ongoing litigation, including legal settlement costs; • an increase in employee compensation, including options expense, of $2.7 million related to an increase in employee head count in our corporate-owned store locations and store support center, as our net revenue growth recovered in the latter half of fiscal 2009, as well as increased store labor hours due to opening additional corporate-owned stores, partially offset by a one-time charge in fiscal 2008 related to the acceleration of performance-based awards; • an increase of $2.3 million related to higher management incentive-based compensation; • an increase in credit card fees of $1.9 million resulting from increased sales volume at corporate-owned stores and the addition of e-commerce sales; • an increase in depreciation costs of $1.8 million primarily related to IT projects placed in use as well as the retirement of fixed assets no longer in use; • an increase in other costs of $0.7 million as a result of the expansion of our business; • an increase in distribution costs of $0.5 million as a result of increased sales volume; and • an increase in occupancy costs of $0.4 million related to our other segment as we opened additional outlet locations in fiscal 2009. These amounts were partially offset by a decrease in discretionary spending of $1.7 million related to travel, meals and entertainment and supplies. We expect selling, general and administrative expenses to increase throughout fiscal 2010 as we add administrative and sales personnel and increase our infrastructure to support the growth in our store base and our e-commerce channel. Our selling, general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008 included $4.8 million and $5.8 million, respectively, of stock-based compensation expense. Income from Operations Income from operations increased $30.0 million, or 53%, to $86.5 million in fiscal 2009 from $56.6 million in fiscal 2008. The increase of $30.0 million in income from operations for fiscal 2009 was primarily due to a $44.0 million increase in gross profit resulting from sales by additional corporate-owned stores opened during fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008 and a decrease of $4.0 million in provision for impairment and lease exit costs, offset by an increase of $18.0 million in selling, general and administrative expenses. On a segment basis, we determine income from operations without taking into account our general corporate expenses such as corporate employee costs, travel expenses and corporate rent. For purposes of our management’s analysis of our financial results, we have allocated some general product expenses to our corporate-owned stores segment. For example, all expenses related to our production, design, merchandise and distribution departments have been allocated to this segment. Income from operations (before general corporate expenses) from: • our corporate-owned stores segment increased $26.7 million, or 28%, to $121.6 million for fiscal 2009 from $94.9 million for fiscal 2008 primarily due to an increase in corporate-owned stores product margin of $45.9 million, offset by an increase of $11.6 million in occupancy and depreciation costs, $4.5 million in store employee expenses, $1.5 million in administrative expenses and $1.5 million in other store expenses; 36 Table of Contents • our franchises segment decreased $2.1 million, or 27%, to $5.5 million in fiscal 2009 from $7.5 million in fiscal 2008, primarily as a result of franchise income from operations of $2.2 million included in the comparative period shifting to corporate-owned stores income from operations when we acquired two franchise stores in Victoria, British Columbia and one franchise store in Bellevue, Washington, partially offset by increased franchise income from operations of $0.6 million from our remaining franchise locations. Opening new franchise stores is not a significant part of our near-term store growth strategy, and as such we do not expect income from operations from our franchises segment to grow in future years as a result of adding franchise locations; and • our other segment increased $7.6 million, or 161%, to $12.4 million in fiscal 2009 from $4.7 million in fiscal 2008 primarily due to an increase in revenue of $23.2 million, offset by an increase of $9.5 million in product costs and an increase of $6.1 million in other administrative expenses. Our direct to consumer sales channel, which is included in our other segment, is an increasingly substantial part of our business and we expect income from operations to continue to increase in future years as a result of this growth. Income from operations also includes general corporate expenses. General corporate expenses increased $2.3 million, or 5%, to $52.9 million in fiscal 2009 from $50.6 million in fiscal 2008 primarily due to an increase in expenses related to our production, design, merchandising and distribution departments of $5.7 million and an increase in depreciation and amortization expense of $1.8 million, offset by a decrease in provision for impairment and lease exit costs of $4.0 million and a decrease in other corporate expenses of $1.2 million. General corporate expenses are expected to continue to increase in future years as we grow our overall business and require increased efforts at our head office to support our corporate-owned stores, franchises and other segments. Our $0.4 million provision for impairment and lease exit costs was a result of management’s review of our portfolio of corporate-owned store locations. In conjunction with our ongoing evaluation to ensure that each of our corporate-owned stores fit into our long-term growth strategy, we closed one of our corporate-owned stores in the first quarter of fiscal 2009. This closure was fully accrued in fiscal 2008. We also closed one of our corporate-owned stores in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008. We recorded a $0.7 million charge related to this closure, which included a $0.5 million asset impairment and a $0.2 million accrual for lease exit costs. The fair market values were estimated using an expected present value technique. Other Income (Expense), Net Other income (expense), net decreased $0.7 million, or 87%, to $0.2 million in fiscal 2009 from $0.8 million in fiscal 2008. Of the $0.7 million decrease in other income (expense), net: • $0.5 million resulted from a decrease in interest income due to lower interest rates offered on cash balances; and • $0.1 million resulted from an increase in interest expense. Provision for Income Taxes Provision for income taxes increased $11.5 million, or 68%, to $28.4 million in fiscal 2009 from $16.9 million in fiscal 2008. In fiscal 2009, our effective tax rate was 32.8% compared to 29.4% in fiscal 2008. The lower effective tax rate in fiscal 2008 was due to the release of the valuation allowance against U.S. loss carry forwards in fiscal 2008. We generated taxable income in the United States in fiscal 2009 which contributed to the increase in the effective tax rate. During fiscal 2009 an adjustment was made to deferred tax assets and additional paid-in capital in the amount of $4,963 relating to windfall recorded in the year ended February 1, 2009 in excess of taxes payable. The Company has concluded that the adjustment was not material to the financial statements. Net Income Net income increased $18.9 million, or 48%, to $58.3 million in fiscal 2009 from $39.4 million in fiscal 2008. The increase in net income of $18.9 million in fiscal 2009 was a result of an increase in gross profit of $44.0 million increase in gross profit resulting from sales by additional corporate-owned stores opened during fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008 and a decrease of $4.0 million in provision for impairment and lease exit costs, offset by an increase of $18.0 million in selling, general and administrative expenses, an increase of $11.5 million in provision for income taxes and a decrease of $0.7 million in other income (expense), net. 37 Table of Contents Comparison of Fiscal 2008 to Fiscal 2007 Net Revenue Net revenue increased $83.5 million, or 31%, to $353.5 million in fiscal 2008 from $269.9 million in fiscal 2007. This increase was primarily the result of sales from new stores opened. Assuming the average exchange rate between the Canadian and United States dollars in fiscal 2007 remained constant, our net revenue would have increased $92.6 million, or 34%, in fiscal 2008. The constant dollar increase in comparable store sales was driven primarily by the strength of our existing product lines, successful introduction of new products and increasing recognition of the lululemon athletica brand name. Fiscal Year Ended February 1, February 3, 2009 2008 (In thousands) Net revenue by segment: Corporate-owned stores $ 315,548 $ 240,441 Franchises 16,198 18,141 Other 21,742 11,360 Total net revenue $ 353,488 $ 269,942 Corporate-Owned Stores. Net revenue from our corporate-owned stores segment increased $75.1 million, or 31%, to $315.5 million in fiscal 2008 from $240.4 million in fiscal 2007. The following contributed to the $75.1 million increase in net revenue from our corporate-owned stores segment: • New stores opened during fiscal 2008 contributed $37.3 million, or 16%, of the increase. During fiscal 2008, we opened 34 corporate-owned stores, consisting of three in Canada and 31 in the United States; • New stores opened during fiscal 2007 prior to sales from such stores becoming part of our comparable store sales base contributed $34.3 million, or 14%, of the increase. This consisted of five stores in Canada and 21 stores in the United States; and • The acquisition of two Victoria, British Columbia and one Bellevue, Washington franchise stores in September 2008 contributed $3.7 million, or 2%, of the increase. The increase was partially offset by comparable store sales decline in fiscal 2008, resulting in a $0.2 million decrease to net revenue. Assuming the average exchange rate between the Canadian and U.S. dollar in fiscal 2007 remained constant, our comparable store sales would have increased 3% in fiscal 2008 and contributed $7.5 million, or 3%, of the increase. Franchises. Net revenue from our franchises segment decreased $1.9 million, or 11%, to $16.2 million in fiscal 2008 from $18.1 million in fiscal 2007. The decrease in net revenue from our franchises segment consisted primarily of franchises net revenue of $2.7 million that shifted to corporate-owned stores net revenue when we acquired two franchise stores in Victoria, British Columbia and one franchise store in Bellevue, Washington. This was partially offset by increased franchise revenue of $0.8 million from our one remaining Canadian franchise location and four franchise locations in the United States. Other. Net revenue from our other segment increased $10.4 million, or 91%, to $21.7 million in fiscal 2008 from $11.4 million in fiscal 2007. The following contributed to the $10.4 million increase in net revenue from our other segment: • temporary store locations opened in fiscal 2008 contributed sales revenue of $3.2 million; • an additional warehouse sale in fiscal 2008 contributed increased sales revenue of $2.8 million; • two new outlet locations opened in fiscal 2008 contributed sales revenue of $2.0 million; • new and existing wholesale accounts contributed $1.2 million of the increase; • showroom sales revenue increased $0.9 million; and • phonesale revenue accounted for $0.4 million of the increase. 38 Table of Contents Gross Profit Gross profit increased $34.1 million, or 24%, to $179.1 million in fiscal 2008 from $144.9 million in fiscal 2007. The increase in gross profit was driven principally by: • an increase of $75.1 million in net revenue from our corporate-owned stores segment; and • an increase of $10.4 million in net revenue from our other segment. This amount was partially offset by: • an increase in product costs of $28.8 million associated with our sale of goods through corporate-owned stores, franchises and other segments; • an increase in occupancy costs of $12.8 million related to an increase in corporate-owned stores; • an increase in depreciation of $4.4 million primarily related to an increase in corporate-owned stores; • an increase of $2.1 million in expenses related to our production, design and merchandising departments; • a decrease of $1.9 million in net revenue from our franchise segment; and • an increase of $1.4 million in expenses related to distribution costs as a result of increased production to support our growth. Gross profit, as a percentage of net revenue, or gross margin, decreased 3.0%, to 50.7% in fiscal 2008 from 53.7% in fiscal 2007. The decrease in gross margin resulted from: • an increase in occupancy costs as a percentage of net revenue that contributed to a decrease in gross margin of 2.0% as a result of decreased sales per store and a resulting deleverage on fixed occupancy costs; • an increase in store depreciation expense as a percentage of net revenue in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 as a result of new store openings in new markets, which contributed to a decrease in gross margin of 0.7%; • an increase in product costs as a percentage of net revenue that contributed to a decrease in gross margin of 0.3%, primarily due to an increase in corporate-owned store product costs and increased mark-downs in consideration of the current economic climate; and • an increase in expenses related to our production, design and merchandising departments as a percentage of net revenue in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007, which contributed to a decrease in gross margin of 0.1%. Our costs of goods sold in fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007 included $0.8 million and $0.7 million, respectively, of stock-based compensation expense. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $24.7 million, or 26%, to $118.1 million in fiscal 2008 from $93.4 million in fiscal 2007. As a percentage of net revenue, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 1.2%, to 33.4%, in fiscal 2008 from 34.6% in fiscal 2007. Of the $24.7 million increase in selling, general and administrative expenses: • $8.7 million resulted from an increase in store employee compensation related to opening additional corporate-owned stores; • $7.0 million resulted from an increase in other store operating expenses primarily related to an increase of $2.6 million in employee costs such as commissions, bonuses, benefits and other employee costs, $1.6 million in credit card fees, $1.0 million in communications, phone and fax expense, $0.8 million in occupancy cost, $0.6 million in repairs and maintenance expense, and $0.3 million in travel expense; • $4.9 million resulted from an increase in corporate compensation principally due to hiring of additional employees to support our growth; 39 Table of Contents • $3.2 million resulted from an increase in depreciation related to property and equipment at the store support centre, including depreciation of our recently implemented software systems; • $2.3 million resulted from an increase in professional fees as a result of increased regulatory requirements associated with being a public company such as advisory fees for internal control compliance and legal fees; and • $0.6 million resulted from an increase in stock-based compensation expense. This amount was partially offset by a decrease in distribution costs of $1.6 million and a decrease in foreign exchange losses of $0.4 million. Our selling, general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007 included $5.8 million and $5.2 million, respectively, of stock-based compensation expense. Income from Operations Income from operations increased $5.0 million, or 10%, to $56.6 million in fiscal 2008 from $51.6 million in fiscal 2007. The increase of $5.0 million in income from operations for fiscal 2008 was primarily due to a $34.1 million increase in gross profit resulting from sales from additional corporate-owned stores opened during fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007, offset by an increase of $24.7 million in selling, general and administrative expenses and a $4.4 million provision for impairment and lease exit costs. On a segment basis, we determine income from operations without taking into account our general corporate expenses such as corporate employee costs, travel expenses and corporate rent. For purposes of our management’s analysis of our financial results, we have allocated some general product expenses to our corporate-owned stores segment. For example, all expenses related to our production, design, merchandise and distribution departments have been allocated to this segment. Income from operations (before general corporate expenses) from: • our corporate-owned stores segment increased $15.0 million, or 19%, to $94.9 million for fiscal 2008 from $79.8 million for fiscal 2007 primarily due to an increase in corporate-owned stores gross profit of $32.9 million, offset by an increase of $12.8 million in store employee expenses, $3.4 million in administrative expenses, and an increase of $1.2 million in other store expenses; • our franchises segment decreased $1.2 million, or 14%, to $7.5 million in fiscal 2008 from $8.8 million in fiscal 2007 primarily as a result of franchise income from operations of $1.8 million included in the comparative period shifting to corporate-owned stores income from operations when we acquired two franchise stores in Victoria, British Columbia and one franchise store in Bellevue, Washington, partially offset by increased franchise income from operations of $0.6 million from our remaining franchise locations; and • our other segment decreased $0.9 million, or 16%, to $4.7 million in fiscal 2008 from $5.6 million in fiscal 2007 primarily due to an increase of $11.3 million in product costs, offset by an increase in revenue of $10.4 million. Income from operations also includes general corporate expenses. General corporate expenses increased $7.9 million, or 19%, to $50.6 million in fiscal 2008 from $42.7 million in fiscal 2007 primarily due to an increase in corporate employee costs of $4.8 million, a provision for impairment and lease exit costs of $4.4 million and an increase in depreciation and amortization expense of $3.2 million, offset by a decrease in other corporate expenses of $4.5 million. Our $4.4 million provision for impairment and lease exit costs was a result of management’s review of our portfolio of corporate-owned store locations. In conjunction with our ongoing evaluation to ensure that each of our corporate-owned stores fit into our long-term growth strategy we closed one of our corporate-owned stores in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008. We recorded a $0.7 million charge related to this closure, which included a $0.5 million asset impairment and a $0.2 million accrual for lease exit costs. The fair market values were estimated using an expected present value technique. We identified four other corporate-owned store locations 40 Table of Contents where the carrying amount of the assets exceeded management’s estimate of the fair value of the location. Asset impairment of $2.5 million was recorded as at February 1, 2009 related to these locations. Further, we accrued $1.2 million for lease exit costs related to certain locations which management has identified as underperforming corporate-owned stores. Other Income (Expense), Net Other income (expense), net decreased $0.2 million, or 20%, to $0.8 million in fiscal 2008 from $1.0 million in fiscal 2007. Of the $0.2 million decrease in other income (expense), net: • $0.2 million resulted from a decrease in interest income; and • $0.1 million resulted from an increase in equity loss associated with our investment in Australia. This amount was partially offset by a $0.1 million decrease in interest expense. Provision for Income Taxes Provision for income taxes decreased $3.6 million, or 17%, to $16.9 million in fiscal 2008 from $20.5 million in fiscal 2007. In fiscal 2008, our effective tax rate was 29.4% compared to 38.9% in fiscal 2007. The reduction in the effective tax rate in fiscal 2008 resulted from the decrease in the Canadian corporate tax rate from 35% to 32% as well as the release of the valuation against U.S. loss carryforwards. Net Income Net income increased $8.5 million, or 28%, to $39.4 million in fiscal 2008 from $30.8 million in fiscal 2007. The increase in net income of $8.5 million in fiscal 2008 was a result of an increase in gross profit of $34.1 million resulting from sales from additional corporate-owned stores opened and an increase of $3.5 million in provision for income taxes, offset by increases in selling, general and administrative expenses of $24.7 million and a $4.4 million provision for impairment and lease exit costs. Seasonality In fiscal 2009, fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007, we recognized a significant amount of our net revenue in the fourth quarter due to significant increases in sales during the holiday season. We recognized 39%, 29% and 39% of our full year gross profit in the fourth quarter in fiscal 2009, fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007, respectively. Despite the fact that we have experienced a significant amount of our net revenue and gross profit in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year, we believe that the true extent of the seasonality or cyclical nature of our business may have been overshadowed by our rapid growth to date. As our expected growth rate slows, we believe that we will experience fourth quarter gross profits as a percentage of full year gross profits as high, or higher, than in the current year. The level of our working capital reflects the seasonality of our business. We expect inventory, accounts payable and accrued expenses to be higher in the third and fourth quarters in preparation for the holiday selling season. Because our products are sold primarily through our stores, order backlog is not material to our business. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our primary sources of liquidity are our current balances of cash and cash equivalents, cash flows from operations and borrowings available under our revolving credit facility. Our primary cash needs are capital expenditures for opening new stores and remodeling existing stores, making information technology system enhancements and funding working capital requirements. Cash and cash equivalents in excess of our needs are held in interest bearing accounts with financial institutions. As of January 31, 2010, our working capital deficit (excluding cash and cash equivalents) was $1.8 million and our cash and cash equivalents were $159.6 million. 41 Table of Contents The following table summarizes our net cash flows provided by and used in operating, investing and financing activities for the periods indicated: Fiscal Year Ended January 31, February 1, February 3, 2010 2009 2008 (In thousands) Total cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 117,960 $ 46,438 $ 36,481 Investing activities (16,307 ) (46,795 ) (35,235 ) Financing activities (2,649 ) 13,460 31,412 Effect of exchange rate changes 3,772 (8,851 ) 4,393 Increase in cash and cash equivalents $ 102,776 $ 4,252 $ 37,051 Operating Activities Operating Activities consist primarily of net income adjusted for certain non-cash items, including depreciation and amortization, deferred income taxes, realized gains and losses on property and equipment, stock-based compensation expense and the effect of the changes in non-cash working capital items, principally accounts receivable, inventories, accounts payable and accrued expenses. In fiscal 2009, cash provided by operating activities increased $71.5 million, to $118.0 million compared to cash provided by operating activities of $46.4 million in fiscal 2008. The $71.5 million increase was primarily a result of increased net income as we expanded our store base and a net decrease in the change in other working capital balances, partially offset by a decrease in items not affecting cash. The net decrease in the change in other working capital balances was primarily due to an increase in accrued liabilities resulting from a provision for impairment and lease exit costs and was partially offset by an increase in the change in inventories as we build up spring and summer inventories for a larger store base. The decrease in items not affecting cash was primarily due to decreases in excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation and deferred income taxes, and was partially offset by an increase in depreciation and amortization related to our increased store base. Depreciation and amortization relate almost entirely to leasehold improvements, furniture and fixtures, computer hardware and software, equipment and vehicles in our stores and other corporate buildings. Depreciation and amortization increased $5.0 million to $20.8 million in fiscal 2009 from $15.8 million in fiscal 2008. Depreciation for our corporate-owned store segment was $13.7 million, $10.6 million and $6.1 million in fiscal 2009, fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007, respectively. Depreciation related to corporate activities was $7.1 million, $5.3 million and $2.1 million in fiscal 2009, fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007, respectively. We have not allocated any depreciation to our franchises or other segments as these amounts to date have been immaterial. Investing Activities Investing Activities relate entirely to capital expenditures, investments in and advances to franchises, and acquisitions of franchises. Cash used in investing activities decreased $30.5 million, to $16.3 million in fiscal 2009 from $46.8 million in fiscal 2008. This decrease in cash used in investing activities represents a decrease in the number of new stores opened in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008, offset by store improvements on a larger store base. Capital expenditures for our corporate-owned stores segment were $10.2 million in fiscal 2009 which included $4.8 million to open ten corporate-owned stores and $30.1 million in fiscal 2008, which included $27.0 million to open 34 corporate-owned stores (not including three acquired franchise stores). The remaining capital expenditures for our corporate-owned stores segment in each period were for ongoing store refurbishment. Capital expenditures related to corporate activities and administration were $5.3 million and $10.9 million in fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008, respectively. The capital expenditures in each period for corporate activities and administration were for improvements at our head office and other corporate buildings as well as investments in information technology. There were no capital expenditures associated with our franchises and other segments. Investment in and advances to franchises 42 Table of Contents are to NEW HARBOUR YOGA PTY LTD. In fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007, we purchased our franchises in Victoria, British Columbia and Bellevue, Washington for $3.4 million and Calgary, Alberta for $5.6 million, respectively. Capital expenditures are expected to range between $27 million to $30 million in fiscal 2010, including approximately $7.0 million to $8.5 million for approximately 12 to 15 new stores and the remainder reflecting renovation capital for existing stores, information technology enhancements and other corporate activities. Financing Activities Financing Activities consist primarily of cash received on the exercise of stock options and excess tax benefits from stock based compensation. Cash provided by financing activities decreased $16.1 million, to cash used of $2.6 million in fiscal 2009 from cash provided of $13.5 million in fiscal 2008. We believe that our cash from operations and borrowings available to us under our revolving credit facility will be adequate to meet our liquidity needs and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 24 months. Our cash from operations may be negatively impacted by a decrease in demand for our products as well as the other factors described in “Risk Factors.” In addition, we may make discretionary capital improvements with respect to our stores, distribution facility, headquarters, or other systems, which we would expect to fund through the issuance of debt or equity securities or other external financing sources to the extent we were unable to fund such capital expenditures out of our cash from operations. Revolving Credit Facility In April 2007, we entered into an uncommitted senior secured demand revolving credit facility with Royal Bank of Canada. The revolving credit facility provides us with available borrowings in an amount up to CDN$20.0 million. The revolving credit facility must be repaid in full on demand and is available by way of prime loans in Canadian currency, U.S. base rate loans in U.S. currency, bankers’ acceptances, LIBOR based loans in U.S. currency or Euro currency, letters of credit in Canadian currency or U.S. currency and letters of guaranty in Canadian currency or U.S. currency. The revolving credit facility bears interest on the outstanding balance in accordance with the following: (i) prime rate for prime loans; (ii) U.S. base rate for U.S. based loans; (iii) a fee of 1.125% per annum on bankers’ acceptances; (iv) LIBOR plus 1.125% per annum for LIBOR based loans; (v) a 1.125% annual fee for letters of credit; and (vi) a 1.125% annual fee for letters of guaranty. Both lululemon usa inc. and lululemon FC USA inc., Inc. provided Royal Bank of Canada with guarantees and postponements of claims in the amounts of CDN$20.0 million with respect to lululemon athletica canada inc.’s obligations under the revolving credit facility. The revolving credit facility is also secured by all of our present and after acquired personal property, including all intellectual property and all of the outstanding shares we own in our subsidiaries. As of January 31, 2010, aside from the letters of credit and guarantees, we had $nil in borrowings outstanding under this credit facility. Contractual Obligations and Commitments Leases. We lease certain corporate-owned store locations, storage spaces, building and equipment under non-cancelable operating leases. Our leases generally have initial terms of between five and 10 years, and generally can be extended only in five-year increments, if at all. Our leases expire at various dates between 2010 and 2020, excluding extensions at our option. A substantial number of our leases for corporate-owned store premises include renewal options and certain of our leases include rent escalation clauses, rent holidays and leasehold rental incentives, none of which are reflected in the following table. Most of our leases for corporate-owned store premises also include contingent rental payments based on sales volume, the impact of which also are not reflected in the following table. During the third quarter of fiscal 2008 we were released from our contractual obligation related to the new head office location in Vancouver, British Columbia. The following table summarizes our contractual arrangements as of January 31, 2010, and the timing and effect that such commitments are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods: Payments Due by Fiscal Year Total 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Thereafter (In thousands) Operating Leases (minimum rent)* $ 207,477 $ 29,551 $ 29,220 $ 29,209 $ 28,726 $ 27,710 $ 63,061 * Includes $250 and $270 for each of the years ending in 2011 and thereafter for one store lease which was terminated on May 15, 2007. 43 Table of Contents Franchise Agreements. As of January 31, 2010, we operated five stores in North America and nine stores in Australia through franchise agreements. Under the terms of our franchise agreements, unless otherwise approved by us, franchisees are permitted to sell only lululemon athletica products, are required to purchase their inventory from us, which we sell at a slight premium to our cost, and are required to pay us a royalty based on a percentage of their gross sales. Under some of our franchise agreements, we have the ability to repurchase franchises at a price equal to a specified percentage of trailing 12-month sales. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We enter into documentary letters of credit to facilitate the international purchase of merchandise. We also enter into standby letters of credit to secure certain of our obligations, including insurance programs and duties related to import purchases. As of January 31, 2010, letters of credit and letters of guarantee totaling $2.6 million have been issued. Other than these standby letters of credit, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, investments in special purpose entities or undisclosed borrowings or debt. In addition, we have not entered into any derivative contracts or synthetic leases. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions. Predicting future events is inherently an imprecise activity and, as such, requires the use of judgment. Actual results may vary from estimates in amounts that may be material to the financial statements. An accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically, could materially impact our consolidated financial statements. We believe that the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements: Revenue Recognition. Net revenue is comprised of corporate-owned store net revenue, franchise licensing fees and royalties as well as sales of products to franchisees, and other net revenue, which includes direct to consumer sales through www.lululemon.com, sales to wholesale accounts, phone sales, warehouse sales and sales from company-operated showrooms, in each case, net of an estimated allowance for sales returns and discounts. Sales to customers through corporate-owned stores are recognized at the point of sale, net of an estimated allowance for sales returns. Franchise licensing fees and royalties are recognized when earned, in accordance with the terms of the franchise/license agreements. Royalties are based on a percentage of the franchisees’ sales and recognized when those sales occur. Franchise fee net revenue arising from the sale of a franchise is recognized when the agreement has been signed and all of our substantial obligations have been completed. Other net revenue is recognized when goods are shipped and collection is reasonably assured, net of an estimated allowance for sales returns. Other net revenue related to warehouse sales is recognized when these sales occur. Amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling are recognized at the time of shipment. Sales are reported on a net revenue basis, which is computed by deducting from our gross sales the amount of sales taxes, actual product returns received, discounts and an amount established for anticipated sales returns. Our estimated allowance for sales returns is a subjective critical estimate that has a direct impact on reported net revenue. This allowance is calculated based on a history of actual returns, estimated future returns and any significant future known or anticipated events. Consideration of these factors results in an estimated allowance for sales returns. Our standard terms for retail sales limit returns to approximately 14 days after the sale of the merchandise. For our wholesale sales, we allow returns from our wholesale customers if properly requested and approved. Employee discounts are classified as a reduction of net revenue. Revenues from the Company’s gift cards are recognized when tendered for payment, or upon redemption. Outstanding customer balances are included in “Unredeemed gift card liability” on the consolidated balance sheets. 44 Table of Contents There are no expiration dates on the Company’s gift cards, and lululemon does not charge any service fees that cause a decrement to customer balances. While the Company will continue to honor all gift cards presented for payment, management may determine the likelihood of redemption to be remote for certain card balances due to, among other things, long periods of inactivity. In these circumstances, to the extent management determines there is no requirement for remitting card balances to government agencies under unclaimed property laws, card balances may be recognized in the consolidated statements of operations in “Net revenue.” Accounts Receivable. Accounts receivable primarily arise out of sales to wholesale accounts, sales of products and royalties on sales owed to us by our franchises. The allowance for doubtful accounts represents management’s best estimate of probable credit losses in accounts receivable. This allowance is established based on the specific circumstances associated with the credit risk of the receivable, the size of the accounts receivable balance, aging of accounts receivable balances and our collection history and other relevant information. The allowance for doubtful accounts is reviewed on a monthly basis. Receivables are charged to the allowance when management believes the account will not be recovered. Inventory. Inventory is valued at the lower of cost and market. Cost is determined using weighted-average costs. For finished goods, market is defined as net realizable value, and for raw materials, market is defined as replacement cost. Cost of inventories includes acquisition and production costs including raw material and labor, as applicable, and all costs incurred to deliver inventory to our distribution centers including freight, non-refundable taxes, duty and other landing costs. We periodically review our inventories and make provisions as necessary to appropriately value obsolete or damaged goods. The amount of the provision is equal to the difference between the book cost of the inventory and its estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demands, selling prices and market conditions. In addition, as part of inventory valuations, we review for inventory shrinkage based on historical trends from actual physical inventories. Inventory shrinkage estimates are made to reduce the inventory value for lost or stolen items. We perform physical inventory counts throughout the year and adjust the shrink reserve accordingly. In fiscal 2009, we wrote-off $0.8 million of inventory and in fiscal 2008 we wrote-off $0.9 million of inventory. Property and Equipment. Property and equipment are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation. Direct internal and external costs related to software used for internal purposes which are incurred during the application development stage or for upgrades that add functionality are capitalized. All other costs related to internal use software are expensed as incurred. Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the lesser of the length of the lease, without consideration of option renewal periods and the estimated useful life of the assets, up to a maximum of five years. All other property and equipment are amortized using the declining balance method as follows: Furniture and fixtures 20 % Computer hardware and software 30 % Equipment and vehicles 30 % We recognize a liability for the fair value of a required asset retirement obligation, or ARO, when such obligation is incurred. Our AROs are primarily associated with leasehold improvements which, at the end of a lease, we are contractually obligated to remove in order to comply with the lease agreement. At the inception of a lease with such conditions, we record an ARO liability and a corresponding capital asset in an amount equal to the estimated fair value of the obligation. The liability is estimated based on a number of assumptions requiring management’s judgment, including store closing costs, cost inflation rates and discount rates, and is accreted to its projected future value over time. The capitalized asset is depreciated using the convention for depreciation of leasehold improvement assets. Upon satisfaction of the ARO conditions, any difference between the recorded ARO liability and the actual retirement costs incurred is recognized as an operating gain or loss in the consolidated statements of operations. Prior to fiscal 2008 these obligations were not material. We recognize a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity when such obligation is incurred. An exit or disposal activity is measured initially at its fair value in the period in which the liability is incurred. We estimate fair value at the cease-use date of its operating leases as the remaining lease rentals, reduced by estimated 45 Table of Contents sublease rentals that could be reasonably obtained for the property, even where we does not intend to enter into a sublease. Estimating the cost of certain lease exit costs involves subjective assumptions, including the time it would take to sublease the leased location and the related potential sublease income. The estimated accruals for these costs could be significantly affected if future experience differs from that used in the initial estimate. Lease exit costs are included in provision for impairment and lease exit costs. Long-Lived Assets. Long-lived assets, including intangible assets with finite useful lives, held for use are evaluated for impairment when the occurrence of events or changes in circumstances indicates that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable as measured by comparing their net book value to the estimated future cash flows generated by their use and eventual disposition. Impaired assets are recorded at fair value, determined principally by discounting the future cash flows expected from their use and eventual disposition. Reductions in asset values resulting from impairment valuations are recognized in income in the period that the impairment is determined. Long-lived assets, including intangible assets with finite useful lives, held for sale are reported at the lower of the carrying value of the asset and fair value less cost to sell. Any write-downs to reflect fair value less selling cost is recognized in income when the asset is classified as held for sale. Gains or losses on assets held for sale and asset dispositions are included in provision for impairment and lease exit costs. Income Taxes. We follow the liability method with respect to accounting for income taxes. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates that are expected to be in effect when these differences are anticipated to reverse. Deferred income tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance, if based on the weight of available positive and negative evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The recognition of a deferred income tax asset is based upon several assumptions and management forecasts, including current and proposed tax legislation, current and anticipated taxable income, utilization of previously unrealized non-operating loss carry forwards and regulatory reviews of tax filings. Given the judgments and estimates required and the sensitivity of the results to the significant assumptions used, we believe the accounting estimates used in relation to the recognition of deferred income tax assets are subject to measurement uncertainty and are susceptible to a material change if the underlying assumptions change. For financial reporting purposes, we generally provide taxes at the rate applicable for the appropriate tax jurisdiction. Because our present intention is to reinvest the unremitted earnings in our foreign operations, we do not provide U.S. income taxes on unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries. Management periodically assesses the need to utilize these unremitted earnings to finance our foreign operations. This assessment is based on cash flow projections that are the result of estimates of future production, fiscal requirements by tax jurisdiction of our operations and operational and fiscal objectives by tax jurisdiction for our operations. Such estimates are inherently imprecise since many assumptions utilized in the cash flow projections are subject to revision in the future. We file income tax returns in the United States, Canada and various foreign and state jurisdictions. We are subject to income tax examination by tax authorities in all jurisdictions from our inception to date. Our policy is to recognize interest expense and penalties related to income tax matters as tax expense. At January 31, 2010, we do not have any significant accruals for interest related to unrecognized tax benefits or tax penalties. Our intercompany transfer pricing policies will be subject to audits by various foreign tax jurisdictions. Although we believe that our intercompany transfer pricing policies and tax positions are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits or potential tax disputes may be materially different from that which is reflected in our income tax provisions and accruals. Goodwill and Intangible Assets. Intangible assets are recorded at cost. Non-competition agreements are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life of five years. Reacquired franchise rights are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives of 10 years. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair market value of identifiable net assets acquired and is not amortized. Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested for impairment annually or more frequently when an event or circumstance indicates that goodwill or indefinite useful live intangible assets might be impaired. We use our best estimates and judgment based on available evidence in conducting the impairment testing. When the carrying 46 Table of Contents amount exceeds the fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess of the carrying value over its fair market value. Stock-Based Compensation. We account for stock-based compensation using the fair value method. The fair value of awards granted is estimated at the date of grant and recognized as employee compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period with the offsetting credit to additional paid-in capital. Our calculation of stock-based compensation requires us to make a number of complex and subjective estimates and assumptions, including future forfeitures, stock price volatility, expected life of the options and related tax effects. Prior to our initial public offering, our board of directors determined the estimated fair value of our common stock on the date of grant based on a number of factors, most significantly our implied enterprise value based upon the purchase price of our securities sold in December 2005 pursuant to an arms-length private placement to a group of private equity investors. The estimation of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment, and to the extent actual results differ from our estimates, such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised. We consider several factors when estimating expected forfeitures, such as types of awards, size of option holder group and anticipated employee retention. Actual results may differ substantially from these estimates. Expected volatility of the stock is based on our review of companies we believe of similar growth and maturity and our peer group in the industry in which we do business because we do not have sufficient historical volatility data for our own stock. The expected term of options granted is derived from the output of the option valuation model and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding. In the future, as we gain historical data for volatility in our own stock and the actual term employees hold our options, expected volatility and expected term may change which could substantially change the grant-date fair value of future awards of stock options and, ultimately, the expense we record. For awards with service and/or performance conditions, the total amount of compensation expense to be recognized is based on the number of awards that are expected to vest and is adjusted to reflect those awards that do ultimately vest. For awards with performance conditions, we recognize the compensation expense over the requisite service period as determined by a range of probability weighted outcomes. For awards with market and or performance conditions, all compensation expense is recognized if the underlying market or performance conditions are fulfilled. Certain employees are entitled to share-based awards from the principal stockholders of the Company. These awards are accounted for as employee compensation expense in accordance with the above noted policies. We commenced applying this guidance when we introduced share-based awards for our employees in the year ended January 31, 2006. Recent Accounting Pronouncements On July 1, 2009, the Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, became the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s, or FASB, officially recognized source of authoritative GAAP, superseding existing FASB, the American Institute of Certified Accountants, the Emerging Issues Task Force and related literature. Rules and interpretive releases of the SEC under the authority of federal securities law are also sources of authoritative GAAP for SEC registrants. All other accounting literature is considered non-authoritative. The switch to the ASC affects the way companies refer to GAAP in financial statements and accounting policies. Citing particular content in the ASC involves specifying the unique numeric path to the content through the Topic, Section and Paragraph structure. This standard was effective prospectively for reporting periods ended after September 15, 2009 and, accordingly, we adopted it during the third quarter of fiscal 2009. The adoption of this standard did not have an effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. As a result of adopting this standard, our references to GAAP standards have been changed to refer to topics, subtopics, sections or subsections of the ASC, as appropriate. In June 2009, the FASB amended ASC Topic 810, Consolidation, which requires a qualitative approach to identifying a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity, or VIE, and requires ongoing assessment of whether an entity is a VIE and whether an interest in a VIE makes the holder a primary beneficiary of the VIE. The amendment will be effective for us at the beginning of fiscal 2010. We are currently evaluating the impact that adoption may have on its consolidated financial statements. In May 2009, the FASB issued ASC Topic 855, Subsequent Events, or ASC 855. ASC 855 establishes general standards of accounting for and disclosures of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued. In particular, ASC 855 sets forth the period after the balance sheet 47 Table of Contents date during which management of a reporting entity should evaluate events or transactions that may occur for potential recognition or disclosure in the consolidated financial statements, the circumstances under which an entity should recognize events or transactions occurring after the balance sheet date in its consolidated financial statements, and the disclosures that an entity should make about events or transactions that occurred after the balance sheet date. Subsequent events were evaluated through March 24, 2010 which is the date the financial statements were issued. We have determined that the standard did not have any impact on our consolidated financial statements. In April 2008, the FASB amended ASC Topic 350, Intangibles and Other, or ASC 350. This new accounting standard, currently contained in ASC 350-30-35, specifically amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset. The objective of this amendment is to improve the consistency between the useful life of a recognized intangible asset and the period of expected cash flows used to measure the fair value of the asset. This new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. The effective date, as well as the adoption date for us, was February 2, 2009. Although ASC 350 may impact our reporting in future financial periods, we have determined that the standard did not have any impact on our historical consolidated financial statements at the time of adoption. In February 2008, the FASB partially delayed the effective date of ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, or ASC 820, for one year for non-financial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a non-recurring basis. The effective date, as well as the adoption date for us, was February 2, 2009. We have determined that the provisions of the topic which were delayed did not have any impact on our consolidated financial statements. In December 2007, the FASB revised the accounting standards for business combinations. This new standard (currently contained in ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations, or ASC 805), among other things, generally requires that an acquirer recognize the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their “full fair values” on the acquisition date. This practice replaces the practice, under predecessor accounting standards, of allocating the cost of an acquisition to the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their relative estimated fair values. This new standard further requires that acquisition-related costs be recognized separately from the related acquisition. In April 2009, the FASB issued ASC 805-20, Business Combinations — Identifiable Assets and Liabilities and Any Non-controlling Interest, which further amends and clarifies ASC 805 and applies to assets acquired and liabilities assumed that arise from contingencies in a business combination. This new standard and the amendment must be applied prospectively to business combinations consummated on or after the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2008. The effective date, as well as the adoption date for us, was February 2, 2009. Although ASC 805 may impact our reporting in future financial periods, we have determined that the standard did not have any impact on our historical consolidated financial statements at the time of adoption. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates. Our market risk exposure is primarily a result of fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. We do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. Foreign Currency Exchange Risk. We currently generate the majority of our net revenue in Canada. The reporting currency for our consolidated financial statements is the U.S. dollar. Historically, our operations were based largely in Canada. As of January 31, 2010, we operated 44 stores in Canada. As a result, we have been impacted by changes in exchange rates and may be impacted materially for the foreseeable future. As we recognize net revenue from sales in Canada in Canadian dollars, and the U.S. dollar has weakened during fiscal 2009, it has had a positive impact on our Canadian operating results upon translation of those results into U.S. dollars for the purposes of consolidation. However, the gain in net revenue was partially offset by higher cost of sales and higher selling, general and administrative expenses that are generated in Canadian dollars. A 10% depreciation in the relative value of the Canadian dollar compared to the U.S. dollar would have resulted in lost income from operations of approximately $11.2 million in fiscal 2009 and approximately $11.1 million in fiscal 2008. To the extent the ratio between our net revenue generated in Canadian dollars increases as compared to our expenses generated in Canadian dollars, we expect that our results of operations will be further impacted by changes in exchange rates. We 48 Table of Contents do not currently hedge foreign currency fluctuations. However, in the future, in an effort to mitigate losses associated with these risks, we may at times enter into derivative financial instruments, although we have not historically done so. We do not, and do not intend to, engage in the practice of trading derivative securities for profit. Interest Rate Risk. In April 2007, we entered into an uncommitted senior secured demand revolving credit facility with Royal Bank of Canada. The revolving credit facility provides us with available borrowings in an amount up to CDN$20.0 million. Because our revolving credit facility bears interest at a variable rate, we will be exposed to market risks relating to changes in interest rates, if we have a meaningful outstanding balance. As of January 31, 2010, we had no outstanding borrowings under our revolving facility. We had small outstanding balances under our revolving facility during fiscal 2009 as we built inventory and working capital for the holiday selling season, but we do not believe we are significantly exposed to changes in interest rate risk. We currently do not engage in any interest rate hedging activity and currently have no intention to do so in the foreseeable future. However, in the future, if we have a meaningful outstanding balance under our revolving facility, in an effort to mitigate losses associated with these risks, we may at times enter into derivative financial instruments, although we have not historically done so. These may take the form of forward sales contracts, option contracts, and interest rate swaps. We do not, and do not intend to, engage in the practice of trading derivative securities for profit. Inflation Inflationary factors such as increases in the cost of our product and overhead costs may adversely affect our operating results. Although we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations to date, a high rate of inflation in the future may have an adverse effect on our ability to maintain current levels of gross margin and selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenue if the selling prices of our products do not increase with these increased costs. 49",2023-12-30 21:53:32.785464
1397187,LULU,lululemon athletica inc.,2011,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS This discussion summarizes our consolidated operating results, financial condition and liquidity during the three-year period ending January 30, 2011. Our fiscal year ends on the Sunday closest to January 31 of the following year, typically resulting in a 52 week year, but occasionally giving rise to an additional week, resulting in a 53 week year. Fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008 ended on January 30, 2011, January 31, 2010 and February 1, 2009, respectively. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements based on current expectations that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions, such as our plans, objectives, expectations and intentions set forth in the “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.” Our actual results and the timing of events may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth in the “Item 1A — Risk Factors” section and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Overview Our results for fiscal 2010 demonstrate the ongoing success of our efforts to overcome the instability in the economy for the last two fiscal years. In fiscal 2010, we committed to investing in our stores and our people, making infrastructure enhancements and funding working capital requirements, while remaining conscious of our discretionary spending. These expenditures were designed to position our business for long-term profitable growth and protect our brand integrity. We continually assess the economic environment and market conditions when making decisions regarding timing of our investments. These strong efforts to execute our strategic plan are reflected in our comparable stores net revenue growth, which leveraged our fixed operating costs and in turn led to higher income from operations. We believe that our brand is recognized as premium in our offerings of run and yoga assortment, as well as a leader in technical fabrics and quality construction. This has made our product desirable to our consumers and has driven demand. Throughout fiscal 2010, we were able to grow our e-commerce website which has further increased our brand awareness and has made our product available in new markets, including those outside of North America. This sales channel offers product assortment with a higher margin than our other segments. We also increased our store base through execution of our real estate strategy, when and where we saw opportunities for success. For example, we opened 23 net new corporate-owned stores and 39 net new showrooms in North America and Australia since fiscal 2009, including reacquired franchises. We believe our strong cash flow generation, solid balance sheet and healthy liquidity provide us with the financial flexibility to continue executing the initiatives which we believe will be beneficial for the Company. In fiscal 2011, we will continue to focus on the execution of our strategic plan. Where we have found opportunities for growth through opening showrooms, or other community presence efforts, we will expand our store base and therefore our business. 12 to 15 of our planned store openings in fiscal 2011 will be in markets seeded by showrooms in fiscal 2010. Continuing increases in traffic and conversion rates on our e-commerce website lead us to believe that there is potential for our direct to consumer segment to become an increasingly substantial part of our business and we continue to commit a portion of our resources to further developing this channel. Further, we see our e-commerce website as an opportunity to increase our brand awareness in international markets. Operating Segment Overview lululemon is a designer and retailer of technical athletic apparel operating primarily in North America and Australia. Our yoga-inspired apparel is primarily marketed under the lululemon athletica and ivivva athletica brand names. We offer a comprehensive line of apparel and accessories including fitness pants, shorts, tops and jackets designed for athletic pursuits such as yoga, running and general fitness, and dance-inspired apparel for female youth. As of January 30, 2011, our branded apparel was principally sold through 137 corporate-owned and franchise stores that are primarily located in Canada, the United States, and Australia and via our e-commerce website through our direct to consumer sales channel. We believe our vertical retail strategy allows us to interact more directly with and gain insights from our customers while providing us with greater control of our brand. In fiscal 29 Table of Contents 2010, 52% of our net revenue was derived from sales of our products in Canada, 46% of our net revenue was derived from the sales of our products in the United States and 2% of our net revenue was derived from sales of our products outside of North America. In fiscal 2009, 60% of our net revenue was derived from sales of our products in Canada, 40% of our net revenue was derived from the sales of our products in the United States and an immaterial amount of our net revenue was derived from sales of our products outside of North America. In fiscal 2008, 69% of our net revenue was derived from sales of our products in Canada, 31% of our net revenue was derived from the sales of our products in the United States and an immaterial amount of our net revenue was derived from sales of our products outside of North America. Our net revenue increased from $40.7 million in fiscal 2004 to $711.7 million in fiscal 2010 representing a 61% compound annual growth rate. Our net revenue from continuing operations also increased from $452.9 million in fiscal 2009 to $711.7 million in fiscal 2010, representing a 57% increase. Our increase in net revenue from fiscal 2004 to fiscal 2010 resulted from the net addition of 23 retail locations in fiscal 2010, seven retail locations and our e-commerce sales channel in fiscal 2009, 35 retail locations in fiscal 2008, 31 retail locations in fiscal 2007, 14 retail locations in fiscal 2006 and 17 retail locations in fiscal 2005, including reacquired franchises, and comparable store sales growth of 37%, 9%, 0%, 34% and 25% in fiscal 2010, fiscal 2009, fiscal 2008, fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006, respectively. Our ability to open new stores and grow sales in existing stores has been driven by increasing demand for our technical athletic apparel and a growing recognition of the lululemon athletica brand. We believe our superior products, strategic store locations, inviting store environment, grassroots marketing approach and distinctive corporate culture are responsible for our strong financial performance. We have three reportable segments: corporate-owned stores, direct to consumer and other. We report our segments based on the financial information we use in managing our businesses. While we receive financial information for each corporate-owned store, we have aggregated all of the corporate-owned stores into one reportable segment due to the similarities in the economic and other characteristics of these stores. Our direct to consumer segment accounted for 8% of our net revenues from continuing operations in fiscal 2010, 4% in fiscal 2009 and 1% in fiscal 2008. Our other segment, consisting of franchise sales, wholesale accounts, sales from company-operated showrooms, warehouse sales and outlets, each accounted for less than 10% of our net revenues from continuing operations in each of fiscal 2010, fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008. We previously reported our franchise channel as an operating segment; however, opening new franchise stores is not part of our near-term store growth strategy, and as such we expect net revenue from our franchise stores to continue to decrease, including as a percentage of total net revenue, in future years. As of January 30, 2011, we sold our products through 133 corporate-owned stores located in Canada, the United States and Australia. We plan to increase our net revenue in North America and Australia by opening additional corporate-owned stores in new and existing markets. Corporate-owned stores accounted for 83% of total net revenue in fiscal 2010, 87% of total net revenue in fiscal 2009 and 89% of total net revenue in fiscal 2008. As of January 30, 2011, our direct to consumer segment included our e-commerce and phone sales channels. E-commerce sales are taken directly from retail customers through www.lululemon.com. Phone sales are taken directly from retail customers through our call center. Our direct to consumer segment is an increasingly substantial part of our growth strategy, and we therefore expect the revenue derived from our direct to consumer sales to comprise more than 10% of the net revenue we report in future fiscal years. In addition to deriving revenue from sales through our corporate-owned stores and direct to consumer, we also derive other net revenue, which includes wholesale customers, as well as franchise sales, warehouse sales and sales through a number of company-operated showrooms. Wholesale customers include select premium yoga studios, health clubs and fitness centers. Franchise sales include inventory sales and royalties related to our four franchise stores located in the United States. Warehouse sales are typically held one or more times a year to sell slow moving inventory or inventory from prior seasons to retail customers at discounted prices. Our showrooms are typically small locations that we open from time to time when we enter new markets and feature a limited selection of our product offering during select hours. Other net revenue accounted for 9% of total revenue in fiscal 2010, 9% of total net revenue in fiscal 2009 and 10% of total net revenue in fiscal 2008. We believe that our athletic apparel has and will continue to appeal to consumers outside of North America who value its technical attributes as well as its function and style. In 2004, we opened our first store in Australia 30 Table of Contents which was operated under a franchise license. In fiscal 2008 we made a 13% equity investment in lululemon athletica australia Pty, our franchise operator. During fiscal 2010 we increased our investment to 80% which has provided us control over lululemon athletica australia Pty. In fiscal 2008, we opened a company-operated showroom in Hong Kong. In the past, we have entered into franchise agreements to distribute lululemon athletica branded products to more quickly disseminate our brand name and increase our net revenue and net income. In exchange for the use of our brand name and the ability to operate lululemon athletica stores in certain regions, our franchisees generally pay us a one-time franchise fee and ongoing royalties based on their gross revenue. Additionally, unless otherwise approved by us, our franchisees are required to sell only lululemon athletica branded products, which are purchased from us at a discount to the suggested retail price. Pursuing new franchise partnerships or opening new franchise stores is not part of our near-term store growth strategy. In some cases, we may exercise our contractual rights to purchase franchises where it is attractive to us. Basis of Presentation Net revenue is comprised of: • corporate-owned store net revenue, which includes sales to customers through corporate-owned stores in North America and Australia; • direct to consumer revenue, which includes sales from our e-commerce website and phone sales; and • other net revenue, which includes wholesale accounts, franchises net revenue, which consists of royalties as well as sales of our products to franchises, warehouse sales, outlets and sales from company-operated showrooms. in each case, net of an estimated allowance for sales returns and discounts. In addition, we separately track comparable store sales, which reflect net revenue at corporate-owned stores that have been open for at least 12 months. Therefore, net revenue from a store is included in comparable store sales beginning with the first month for which the store has a full month of comparable prior year sales. Non-comparable store sales include sales from new stores that have not been open or otherwise not operated by us for 12 months or from stores which have been significantly remodeled or relocated. Also included in non-comparable stores sales are sales from direct to consumer sales, wholesale, franchises, warehouse sales and showrooms, and sales from corporate-owned stores which we have closed. By measuring the change in year-over-year net revenue in stores that have been open for 12 months or more, comparable store sales allows us to evaluate how our core store base is performing. Various factors affect comparable store sales, including: • the location of new stores relative to existing stores; • consumer preferences, buying trends and overall economic trends; • our ability to anticipate and respond effectively to customer preferences for technical athletic apparel; • competition; • changes in our merchandise mix; • pricing; • the timing of our releases of new merchandise and promotional events; • the effectiveness of our grassroots marketing efforts; • the level of customer service that we provide in our stores; • our ability to source and distribute products efficiently; and • the number of stores we open, close (including for temporary renovations) and expand in any period. 31 Table of Contents Opening new stores is an important part of our growth strategy. Accordingly, comparable store sales has limited utility for assessing the success of our growth strategy insofar as comparable store sales do not reflect the performance of stores open less than 12 months. Cost of goods sold includes: • the cost of purchased merchandise, inbound freight, duty and non-refundable taxes incurred in delivering goods to our distribution centers; • the cost of our distribution centers (such as labor, rent and utilities) and the depreciation and amortization related to our distribution centers; • the cost of our production, merchandise and design departments including salaries, stock-based compensation and benefits, and operating expenses; • the cost of occupancy related to store operations (such as rent and utilities) and the depreciation and amortization related to store-level capital expenditures; • hemming; and • shrink and valuation reserves. Cost of goods sold also may change as we open or close stores because of the resulting change in related occupancy costs. The primary drivers of the costs of individual goods are the costs of raw materials and labor in the countries where we source our merchandise. Selling, general and administrative expenses consist of all operating costs not otherwise included in cost of goods sold and provision for impairment and lease exit costs. Our selling, general and administrative expenses include marketing costs, accounting costs, information technology costs, human resource costs, professional fees, corporate facility costs, corporate and store-level payroll and benefits expenses, stock-based compensation and occupancy, depreciation and amortization expense for all assets other than depreciation and amortization expenses related to store-level capital expenditures and our distribution centers, each of which are included in cost of goods sold. We anticipate that our selling, general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars due to anticipated continued growth of our corporate support staff and store-level employees. Provision for impairment and lease exit costs consists of asset impairments, lease exit and other related costs associated with the relocation of our administrative offices and the closure of one Canadian corporate-owned store in fiscal 2010, as well as management’s evaluation of corporate-owned locations. Also included in prior years, are one US corporate-owned store in the first quarter of fiscal 2009 and one US corporate-owned store in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 as well as an asset impairment provision based on management’s ongoing evaluation of its portfolio of corporate-owned store locations. Long-lived assets are reviewed at the store-level periodically for impairment or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that full recoverability of net assets through future cash flows is in question. Factors used in the evaluation include, but are not limited to, management’s plans for future operations, recent operating results and projected cash flows. Stock-based compensation expense includes charges incurred in recognition of compensation expense associated with grants of stock options, performance stock units and restricted stock units. We recognize stock-based compensation expense for both awards granted by us and awards granted under a stockholder sponsored plan. Stock-based compensation expense is measured at the grant date, based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as an expense over the requisite service period. We record our stock-based compensation expense in cost of goods sold and selling, general and administrative expenses as stock-based awards have been made to employees whose salaries are classified in both expense categories. Other income (expense), net includes interest earned on our cash balances and our advances to franchise, interest costs associated with our credit facilities and with letters of credit drawn under these facilities for the purchase of merchandise and our share of the operations of our investment in lululemon athletica australia PTY, including the remeasurement of our investment immediately before obtaining control of the business. We expect to 32 Table of Contents continue to generate interest income to the extent that our cash generated from operations exceeds our cash used for investment. We have maintained relatively small outstanding balances on our credit facilities and expect to continue to do so. Provision for income taxes depends on the statutory tax rates in the countries where we sell our products. Historically we have generated taxable income in Canada and we have generated tax losses in the United States. For periods up to and including the second quarter of fiscal 2007, we recorded a full valuation allowance against our losses in the United States. In the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2007, we earned taxable income in the United States. During the second quarter of fiscal 2008, after considering a number of factors, including recent taxable income, utilization of previously unrealized net operating losses, or NOLs, our growth strategy as well as other business and macroeconomic factors, we determined that we would more likely than not realize the benefit of deferred tax assets through future taxable income. We have recorded deferred tax assets in respect of foreign tax credits and other deductible temporary differences of $7.9 million as at January 30, 2011. Several factors have contributed to our effective tax rate fluctuating in recent periods. First, in fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007, we generated losses in the United States which we were unable to offset against our income in Canada. Second, we incurred stock-based compensation expense of $7.3 million, $5.6 million and $6.5 million in fiscal 2010, fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008, respectively, a portion of which were not deductible for tax purposes in Canada and the United States during these periods. Third, the Canadian corporate tax rate decreased from 35% to 32% in fiscal 2008. Fourth, in fiscal 2008 we began to release the valuation against US loss carry forwards. Our effective tax rate in fiscal 2010 was 33%, compared to 33% in fiscal 2009 and 29% in fiscal 2008. We anticipate that in the future we may start to sell our products directly to some customers located outside of Canada, the United States and Australia, in which case we would become subject to taxation based on the foreign statutory rates in the countries where these sales take place and our effective tax rate could fluctuate accordingly. Results of Operations The following tables summarize key components of our results of operations for the periods indicated, both in dollars and as a percentage of net revenue: Fiscal Year Ended January 30, January 31, February 1, 2011 2010 2009 (In thousands) Consolidated statements of operations: Net revenue $ 711,704 $ 452,898 $ 353,488 Cost of goods sold 316,757 229,812 174,421 Gross profit 394,947 223,086 179,067 Operating expenses: Selling, general and administrative expenses 212,784 136,161 118,098 Provision for impairment and lease exit costs 1,772 379 4,405 Income from operations 180,391 86,546 56,564 Other income (expense), net 2,886 164 821 Income before provision for income taxes 183,277 86,710 57,385 Provision for income taxes 61,080 28,429 16,884 Net income from continuing operations 122,197 58,281 40,501 Net income attributable to non-controlling interest 350 — — Net loss from discontinued operations — — (1,138 ) Net income attributable to lululemon athletica inc. $ 121,847 $ 58,281 $ 39,363 33 Table of Contents Fiscal Year Ended January 30, January 31, February 1, 2011 2010 2009 (% of net revenue)} Net revenue 100.0 100.0 100.0 Cost of goods sold 44.5 50.7 49.3 Gross profit 55.5 49.3 50.7 Operating expenses: Selling, general and administrative expenses 29.9 30.1 33.5 Provision for impairment and lease exit costs 0.2 0.1 1.2 Income from operations 25.4 19.1 16.0 Other income (expense), net 0.4 0.1 0.2 Income before provision for income taxes 25.8 19.2 16.2 Provision for income taxes 8.6 6.3 4.8 Net income from continuing operations 17.2 12.9 11.4 Net income attributable to non-controlling interest 0.1 — — Net loss from discontinued operations — — (0.3 ) Net income attributable to lululemon athletica inc 17.1 12.9 11.1 Comparison of Fiscal 2010 to Fiscal 2009 Net Revenue Net revenue increased $258.8 million, or 57%, to $711.7 million in fiscal 2010 from $452.9 million for in fiscal 2009. Assuming the average exchange rate between the Canadian and United States dollars in fiscal 2009 remained constant, our net revenue would have increased $229.6 million, or 51%, in fiscal 2010. The net revenue increase was driven by increased sales at locations in our comparable stores base, sales from new stores and showrooms opened, sales from franchised stores that were reacquired during fiscal 2010 and the growth of our e-commerce website sales included in our direct to consumer segment. The constant dollar increase in comparable store sales was driven primarily by the strength of our existing product lines, the successful introduction of new products and increasing recognition of the lululemon athletica brand name, especially at our U.S. stores. Our net revenue on a segment basis for fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009 are expressed in dollar amounts as well as relevant percentages, presented as a percentage of total net revenue below. Fiscal Year Ended January 30, 2011 and January 31, 2010 2010 2009 2010 2009 (In thousands) (Percentages) Corporate-owned stores $ 591,031 $ 393,451 83.0 86.9 Direct to consumer 57,348 18,257 8.1 4.0 Other 63,325 41,190 8.9 9.1 Net revenue $ 711,704 $ 452,898 100.0 100.0 Corporate-Owned Stores. Net revenue from our corporate-owned stores segment increased $197.6 million, or 50%, to $591.0 million in fiscal 2010 from $393.5 million in fiscal 2009. The following contributed to the $197.6 million increase in net revenue from our corporate-owned stores segment: • Comparable store sales increase of 37% in fiscal 2010 resulted in a $136.1 million increase to net revenue, including the effect of foreign currency fluctuations. Excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations, comparable store sales increased 30%, or $112.2 million, in fiscal 2010; • Net revenue from corporate-owned stores we opened during fiscal 2010, and during fiscal 2009 prior to sales from such stores becoming part of our comparable stores base, contributed $42.3 million of the increase. Net new store openings in fiscal 2010 included 12 stores in the United States and two in Australia; and 34 Table of Contents • The acquisition of one Canadian and nine Australian franchise stores in fiscal 2010 contributed $20.4 million of the increase. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in net revenue related to gift card breakage. In fiscal 2009 we recorded a one-time credit of $1.3 million related to a change in our estimated rate of redemption. Direct to Consumer. Net revenue from our direct to consumer segment increased $39.1 million, or 214%, to $57.3 million in fiscal 2010 from $18.3 million in fiscal 2009. The increase in net revenue from our direct to consumer segment was a result of increasing traffic and conversion rates on our e-commerce website since it launched near the beginning of fiscal 2009. Prior to the launch of our e-commerce website, our direct to consumer segment consisted only of phone sales, and ultimately resulted in an increased gross profit. Other. Net revenue from our other segment increased $22.1 million, or 54%, to $63.3 million in fiscal 2010 from $41.2 million in fiscal 2009. There were increases in net revenues across most of our sales channels included in our other segment: wholesale, showrooms, warehouse sales and outlets. Net revenues from our franchise channel decreased due to our reacquisition of one franchised store in Canada and nine franchised stores in Australia. Our other segment continues to grow year over year through new showroom locations, new wholesale partners and net revenue growth at existing locations attributable to a strong product offering and brand interest. We continue to employ our other segment strategy to increase interest in our product in markets we have not otherwise entered with corporate-owned stores. Gross Profit Gross profit increased 171.9 million, or 77%, to 394.9 million in fiscal 2010 from $223.1 million in fiscal 2009. The increase in gross profit was driven principally by increased net revenues as well as a strengthening Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar, which improved product margin in all of our operating segments, and ultimately resulted in an increased gross profit. The increase in gross profit was partially offset by increases in fixed costs, such as occupancy costs and depreciation, as well as increased costs related to our design, production, distribution and merchandising departments. Gross profit, as a percentage of net revenue, or gross margin, increased 620 basis points, to 55.5% in fiscal 2010 from 49.3% in fiscal 2009. The increase in gross margin resulted primarily from: • a decrease in fixed costs, such as occupancy costs and depreciation, relative to the increase in net revenue, which had a leveraging effect on gross margin and contributed to an increase in gross margin of 250 basis points; • an increase in product margins in corporate-owned stores, direct to consumer and other segments, which contributed to an increase in gross margin of 180 basis points primarily as a result of improved product costing on our spring, summer, and fall assortment of merchandise and a higher proportion of total sales coming from our direct to consumer segment; • an improvement in the Canadian dollar, relative to the U.S. dollar, decreased foreign exchange impacts on product costs and contributed to an increase in gross margin of 140 basis points; and • a decrease in costs related to design, production, distribution and merchandising, relative to the increase in net revenue, which had a leveraging effect on gross margin and contributed to an increase in gross margin of 50 basis points. Our costs of goods sold in fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009 included $1.4 million and $0.8 million, respectively, of stock-based compensation expense. 35 Table of Contents Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses, including provision for impairment and lease exit costs, increased $78.0 million, or 57%, to $214.6 million in fiscal 2010 from $136.5 million in fiscal 2009. The $78.0 million increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was principally comprised of: • an increase in employee costs of $24.8 million as we experience natural growth in labor hours associated with new corporate-owned stores, showrooms, outlets and other, and growth at existing locations; • an increase in variable administrative costs of $18.4 million related to our direct to consumer segment, primarily associated with revenue growth in our e-commerce website sales channel; • an increase in other costs, including occupancy costs, depreciation, distribution and provision for impairment and lease exist costs not included in cost of goods sold, of $14.5 million as a result of the expansion of our business; • an increase in head office employee costs, including stock-based compensation expense and management incentive-based compensation, of $9.6 million incurred in order to position us for long-term growth; • an increase in administrative costs of $6.5 million related to our Australian business, in which we increased our investment significantly in the second quarter of fiscal 2010, which we now report on a consolidated basis; • an increase in marketing efforts, including initiatives associated with the Olympic games, of $3.3 million to increase our brand awareness in both new and existing markets; and • an increase in professional fees of $0.9 million which includes consulting fees for recruiting, store development and information systems, legal fees associated with reacquisition of franchise rights, and employment matters. As a percentage of net revenue, selling, general and administrative expenses were 30.1% in both fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009. We expect selling, general and administrative expenses to increase throughout fiscal 2011 as we add administrative and sales personnel and increase our infrastructure to support the growth in our store base and invest in our e-commerce channel. Our selling, general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009 included $5.9 million and $4.8 million, respectively, of stock-based compensation expense. Income from Operations Income from operations increased $93.8 million, or 108%, to $180.4 million in fiscal 2010 from $86.5 million in fiscal 2009. The increase of $93.8 million in income from operations for fiscal 2010 was primarily due to a $171.9 million increase in gross profit resulting from sales growth at existing and additional corporate-owned stores opened during fiscal 2010 and increasing traffic on our e-commerce website, offset by an increase of $78.0 million in selling, general and administrative expenses including provision for impairment and lease exit costs. On a segment basis, we determine income from operations without taking into account our general corporate expenses such as corporate employee costs, travel expenses and corporate rent. For purposes of our management’s analysis of our financial results, we have allocated some general product expenses to our corporate-owned stores segment. For example, all expenses related to our production, design, merchandise and distribution departments have been allocated to this segment. 36 Table of Contents Income from operations (before general corporate expenses) for fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009 are expressed in dollar amounts as well as percentages, presented as a percentage of net revenue of their respective operating segments below. Fiscal Year Ended January 30, 2011 and January 31, 2010 2010 2009 2010 2009 (In thousands) (Percentages) Corporate-owned stores $ 215,154 $ 121,614 36.4 30.9 Direct to consumer 16,364 6,288 28.5 34.4 Other 18,004 10,845 28.4 26.3 Income from operations before general corporate expense $ 249,522 $ 138,747 Corporate-Owned Stores. Net income from our corporate-owned stores segment increased $93.5 million, or 77%, to $215.2 million for fiscal 2010 from $121.6 million for fiscal 2009 primarily due to an increase of $134.0 million in gross profit, which was offset partially by a natural increase in selling, general and administrative expenses related to employee costs as well as operating expenses associated with new stores and net revenue growth at existing stores. Direct to consumer. Net income from our direct to consumer segment increased $10.1 million, or 160%, to $16.4 million in fiscal 2010 from $6.3 million in fiscal 2009. Prior to the launch of our e-commerce website, our direct to consumer segment consisted only of phone sales. The addition of our e-commerce website near the beginning of fiscal 2009 has driven the increase in income from operations for our direct to consumer segment. Income from operations as a percentage of direct to consumer revenues decreased in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 due to the introduction of promotional shipping and increased costs related to our digital strategy associated with this selling channel. Other. Net income from our other segment increased $7.2 million, or 66%, to $18.0 million in fiscal 2010 from $10.8 million in fiscal 2009. Gross profit related to our other segment increased in fiscal 2010 from fiscal 2009 primarily due to a higher proportion of full margin sales channels in the current year, such as our showroom sales channel, than in the prior year. There was an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses as a result of opening and operating an increased number of showrooms in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009, which offset a portion of the gross profit increase. Income from operations also includes general corporate expenses. General corporate expenses increased $16.9 million, or 32%, to $69.1 million in fiscal 2010 from $52.2 million in fiscal 2009 primarily due to an increase in expenses related to our head office growth of $13.6 million, as well as increased depreciation and amortization expense of $1.2 million, increased stock-based compensation expense of $1.0 million and increased provision for impairment and lease exist costs of $1.4 million. The increase was partially offset by increases in realized foreign exchange gains of $0.3 million. General corporate expenses are expected to continue to increase in future years as we grow our overall business and require increased efforts at our head office to support our corporate-owned stores, franchises and other segments. Our $1.8 million provision for impairment and lease exit costs was a result of management’s review of our portfolio of corporate-owned store locations and the relocation of our administrative offices. In conjunction with our ongoing evaluation to ensure that each of our corporate-owned stores fit into our long-term growth strategy, we closed two of our corporate-owned stores in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010. We recorded a $0.7 million provision for impairment and lease exit costs related to the two fiscal 2010 closures, and a $0.9 million provision for impairment and lease exit costs related to the relocation of our administrative offices. We also closed one of our corporate-owned stores in the first quarter of fiscal 2009; this closure was fully accrued in fiscal 2008. The fair market values were estimated using an expected present value technique. Other Income (Expense), Net Other income (expense), net increased $2.7 million, to $2.9 million in fiscal 2010 from $0.2 million in fiscal 2009. The increase was primarily a result of re-measuring our 13 percent non-controlling equity investment in Australia immediately prior to obtaining control of the business, which led to a $1.8 million gain on investment. 37 Table of Contents Additionally, we earned more interest income in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 on our increased cash balances. Provision for Income Taxes Provision for income taxes increased $32.7 million, or 115%, to $61.1 million in fiscal 2010 from $28.4 million in fiscal 2009. In fiscal 2010, our effective tax rate was 33.3% compared to 32.8% in fiscal 2009. The higher effective tax rate was due to the proportional increase of taxable income in the United States in fiscal 2010 compared to taxable income in Canada which is taxed at a rate lower than the US statutory rate combined with the declining Canadian Corporate tax rate. We expect this trend to continue as we expect to generate a higher proportion of our future taxable income in the United States. We have not recorded deferred taxes on undistributed earnings and other temporary differences of our Canadian subsidiary which are considered to be indefinitely reinvested. If management’s intentions with respect to these undistributed earnings and other temporary differences were to change in the future, deferred taxes may need to be provided that could materially impact our financial results. Net Income Net income increased $63.6 million, or 109%, to $121.8 million in fiscal 2010 from $58.3 million in fiscal 2009. The increase in net income of $63.6 million in fiscal 2010 was primarily due to a $171.9 million increase in gross profit resulting from sales growth at existing and additional corporate-owned stores opened during fiscal 2010 and increasing traffic on our e-commerce website, and a $2.7 million increase in other income (expense), net, offset by an increase of $78.0 million in selling, general and administrative expenses including provision for impairment and lease exist costs and an increase of $32.7 million in provision for income taxes. Comparison of Fiscal 2009 to Fiscal 2008 Net Revenue Net revenue increased $99.4 million, or 28%, to $452.9 million in fiscal 2009 from $353.5 million in fiscal 2008. Assuming the average exchange rate between the Canadian and United States dollars in fiscal 2008 remained constant, our net revenue would have increased $103.0 million, or 29%, in fiscal 2009. The net revenue increase was primarily the result of increased sales at locations in our comparable stores base as well as sales from new stores opened. The constant dollar increase in comparable store sales was driven primarily by the strength of our existing product lines, successful introduction of new products and increasing recognition of the lululemon athletica brand name. Our net revenue on a segment basis for fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008 are expressed in dollar amounts as well as relevant percentages, presented as a percentage of total net revenue below. Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2010 and February 1, 2009 2009 2008 2009 2008 (In thousands) (Percentages) Corporate-owned stores $ 393,451 $ 315,548 86.9 89.3 Direct to consumer 18,257 1,629 4.0 0.5 Other 41,190 36,311 9.1 10.2 Net revenue $ 452,898 $ 353,488 100.0 100.0 Corporate-Owned Stores. Net revenue from our corporate-owned stores segment increased $77.9 million, or 25%, to $393.5 million in fiscal 2009 from $315.5 million in fiscal 2008. The following contributed to the $77.9 million increase in net revenue from our corporate-owned stores segment: • Net revenue from corporate-owned stores we opened during fiscal 2009, and during fiscal 2008 prior to sales from such stores becoming part of our comparable stores base, contributed $46.5 million of the increase. Net new store openings in fiscal 2009 included two stores in Canada and five stores in the United States; 38 Table of Contents • Comparable store sales increase of 9% in fiscal 2009 resulted in a $26.6 million increase to net revenue, excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations. Including the effect of foreign currency fluctuations, comparable store sales increased 8%, or $24.1 million, in fiscal 2009; • Net revenue related to gift card breakage contributed $2.2 million of the increase. Based on historical gift card breakage, we recognize into revenue a portion of gift card sales for which we estimate redemption is remote over the estimated period of redemption. This includes a one-time credit of $1.3 million recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2009 related to a change in our estimated rate of redemption; and • The acquisition of two Victoria, British Columbia and one Bellevue, Washington franchise stores in September 2008 contributed $5.1 million before entering the comparative store base. Direct to Consumer. Net revenue from our direct to consumer segment increased $16.6 million, or 1,020%, to $18.3 million in fiscal 2009 from $1.6 million in fiscal 2008. The increase in net revenue from our direct to consumer segment was primarily due to the launch of our e-commerce in fiscal 2009, which contributed $16.8 million in net revenues. This increase was offset by decreased phonesale revenue, which shifted to e-commerce, of $0.2 million. Other. Net revenue from our other segment increased $4.9 million, or 13%, to $41.2 million in fiscal 2009 from $36.3 million in fiscal 2008. An increase in outlet revenues of $5.0 million contributed to the increase in net revenues from our other segment. This increase in outlet revenue resulted from a $3.2 million increase in revenue at existing outlet locations and a $1.8 million increase in net revenue from two new outlet locations that opened in fiscal 2009. New and existing wholesale accounts contributed $4.4 million to the increase, and increased showroom sales revenue contributed $1.6 million. The increase in net revenue from our other segment was offset by temporary store locations opened in fiscal 2008 but not fiscal 2009, which had contributed $3.2 million, and decreased warehouse revenue due to fewer warehouse sales in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008, of $0.6 million. $2.2 million of franchise net revenue shifted to the corporate-owned stores segment when we acquired two franchise stores in Victoria, British Columbia and one franchise store in Bellevue, Washington. Gross Profit Gross profit increased $44.0 million, or 25%, to $223.1 million in fiscal 2009 from $179.1 million in fiscal 2008. The increase in gross profit was driven principally by increased net revenues which ultimately resulted in an increased gross profit. The increase in gross profit was partially offset by increased fixed costs, such as occupancy and depreciation, increased costs related to our design, production, distribution and merchandising departments, as well as increased discounts, shrinkage and other as a result of increased sales volume. Gross profit, as a percentage of net revenue, or gross margin, decreased 140 basis points, to 49.3% in fiscal 2009 from 50.7% in fiscal 2008. The decrease in gross margin resulted from: • unfavorable foreign exchange differences of 130 basis points on product costs, depreciation, occupancy and production, design, merchandising and distribution departments as a result of the weakening Canadian dollar; • a decrease in corporate-owned stores, franchise and other product margins, which contributed a decrease in gross margin of 60 basis points as a result of increased direct product costs, markdowns and discounts; and • an increase in write-downs and other of 10 basis points. This was partially offset by a decrease in expenses related to our production, design, merchandising and distribution departments, relative to the increase in net revenue, which had a leveraging effect on gross margin and contributed an increase of 60 basis points. Our costs of goods sold in fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008 included $0.8 million and $0.8 million, respectively, of stock-based compensation expense. 39 Table of Contents Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses, including the provision for impairment and lease exit costs, increased $14.0 million, or 11%, to $136.5 million in fiscal 2009 from $122.5 million in fiscal 2008. As a percentage of net revenue, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 460 basis points, to 30.1%, in fiscal 2009 from 34.7% in fiscal 2008. Of the $14.0 million increase in selling, general and administrative expenses: • an increase in administrative costs related to our direct to consumer segment, primarily associated with the launch in fiscal 2009 of our new e-commerce website, of $5.6 million; • an increase of $3.8 million primarily associated with employment-related legal matters, professional fees and legal costs associated with ongoing litigation, including legal settlement costs; • an increase in employee compensation, including options expense, of $2.7 million related to an increase in employee head count in our corporate-owned store locations and store support center, as our net revenue growth recovered in the latter half of fiscal 2009, as well as increased store labor hours due to opening additional corporate-owned stores, partially offset by a one-time charge in fiscal 2008 related to the acceleration of performance-based awards; • an increase of $2.3 million related to higher management incentive-based compensation; • an increase in credit card fees of $1.9 million resulting from increased sales volume at corporate-owned stores and the addition of e-commerce sales; • an increase in depreciation costs of $1.8 million primarily related to IT projects placed in use as well as the retirement of fixed assets no longer in use; • an increase in other costs of $0.7 million as a result of the expansion of our business; • an increase in distribution costs of $0.5 million as a result of increased sales volume; and • an increase in occupancy costs of $0.4 million related to our other segment as we opened additional outlet locations in fiscal 2009. These amounts were partially offset by a decrease in the provision for impairment and lease exit costs of $4.0 million, and a decrease in discretionary spending of $1.7 million related to travel, meals and entertainment and supplies. Our selling, general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008 included $4.8 million and $5.8 million, respectively, of stock-based compensation expense. Income from Operations Income from operations increased $30.0 million, or 53%, to $86.5 million in fiscal 2009 from $56.6 million in fiscal 2008. The increase of $30.0 million in income from operations for fiscal 2009 was primarily due to a $44.0 million increase in gross profit resulting from sales by additional corporate-owned stores opened during fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008, offset by an increase of $14.0 million in selling, general and administrative expenses including provision for impairment and lease exit costs. On a segment basis, we determine income from operations without taking into account our general corporate expenses such as corporate employee costs, travel expenses and corporate rent. For purposes of our management’s analysis of our financial results, we have allocated some general product expenses to our corporate-owned stores segment. For example, all expenses related to our production, design, merchandise and distribution departments have been allocated to this segment. Income from operations (before general corporate expenses) for fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008 are expressed in dollar amounts as well as percentages, presented as a percentage of net revenue of their respective operating segments below. 40 Table of Contents Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2010 and February 1, 2009 2009 2008 2009 2008 (In thousands) (Percentages) Corporate-owned stores $ 121,614 $ 94,867 30.9 30.1 Direct to consumer 6,288 663 34.4 40.7 Other 10,845 11,550 26.3 31.8 Income from operations before general corporate expense $ 138,747 $ 107,080 Corporate-owned Stores. Net income from our corporate-owned stores segment increased $26.7 million, or 28%, to $121.6 million for fiscal 2009 from $94.9 million for fiscal 2008 primarily due to an increase in corporate-owned stores product margin of $45.9 million, which was offset by an increase of $11.6 million in occupancy and depreciation costs, $4.5 million in store employee expenses, $1.5 million in administrative expenses and $1.5 million in other store expenses. Direct to Consumer. Net income from our direct to consumer segment increased $5.6 million, or 849%, to $6.3 million in fiscal 2009 from $0.7 million in fiscal 2008. This increase was primarily due to the launch of our e-commerce in fiscal 2009. Our direct to consumer sales segment is an increasingly substantial part of our business and we expect income from operations to continue to increase in future years as a result of this growth. Other. Net income from our other segment decreased $0.7 million, or 6%, to $10.8 million in fiscal 2009 from $11.6 million in fiscal 2008. This decrease was partially a result of franchise income from operations of $2.2 million shifting to corporate-owned stores income from operations when we acquired two franchise stores in Victoria, British Columbia and one franchise store in Bellevue, Washington. The decrease was partially offset by increased income from operations from our wholesale channel, showroom, outlet and remaining franchise locations. Opening new franchise stores is not a significant part of our near-term store growth strategy, and as such we do not expect income from operations from our franchises to grow in future years as a result of adding franchise locations. Increased outlet, wholesale, and showroom income from operations contributed to the remaining difference. Income from operations also includes general corporate expenses. General corporate expenses increased $1.7 million, or 3%, to $52.2 million in fiscal 2009 from $50.5 million in fiscal 2008 primarily due to an increase in expenses related to our head office growth of $5.1 million and an increase in depreciation and amortization expense of $1.8 million, offset by a decrease in provision for impairment and lease exit costs of $4.0 million and a decrease in other corporate expenses of $1.2 million. General corporate expenses are expected to continue to increase in future years as we grow our overall business and require increased efforts at our head office to support our corporate-owned stores, franchises and other segments. Our $0.4 million provision for impairment and lease exit costs was a result of management’s review of our portfolio of corporate-owned store locations. In conjunction with our ongoing evaluation to ensure that each of our corporate-owned stores fit into our long-term growth strategy, we closed one of our corporate-owned stores in the first quarter of fiscal 2009. This closure was fully accrued in fiscal 2008. We also closed one of our corporate-owned stores in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008. We recorded a $0.7 million charge related to this closure, which included a $0.5 million asset impairment and a $0.2 million accrual for lease exit costs. The fair market values were estimated using an expected present value technique. Other Income (Expense), Net Other income (expense), net decreased $0.7 million, or 80%, to $0.2 million in fiscal 2009 from $0.8 million in fiscal 2008. Of the $0.7 million decrease in other income (expense), net: • $0.5 million resulted from a decrease in interest income due to lower interest rates offered on cash balances; and • $0.1 million resulted from an increase in interest expense. 41 Table of Contents Provision for Income Taxes Provision for income taxes increased $11.5 million, or 68%, to $28.4 million in fiscal 2009 from $16.9 million in fiscal 2008. In fiscal 2009, our effective tax rate was 32.8% compared to 29.4% in fiscal 2008. The lower effective tax rate in fiscal 2008 was due to the release of the valuation allowance against U.S. loss carry forwards in fiscal 2008. We generated taxable income in the United States in fiscal 2009 which contributed to the increase in the effective tax rate. During fiscal 2009 an adjustment was made to deferred tax assets and additional paid-in capital in the amount of $4,963 relating to windfall recorded in the year ended February 1, 2009 in excess of taxes payable. We concluded that the adjustment was not material to the financial statements. Net Income Net income increased $18.9 million, or 48%, to $58.3 million in fiscal 2009 from $39.4 million in fiscal 2008. The increase in net income of $18.9 million in fiscal 2009 was a result of an increase in gross profit of $44.0 million increase in gross profit resulting from sales by additional corporate-owned stores opened during fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008, offset by an increase of $14.0 million in selling, general and administrative expenses including provision for impairment and lease exit costs, an increase of $11.5 million in provision for income taxes and a decrease of $0.7 million in other income (expense), net. Seasonality In fiscal 2010, fiscal 2009, and fiscal 2008, we recognized a significant amount of our net revenue in the fourth quarter due to significant increases in sales during the holiday season. We recognized 36%, 39%, and 29% of our full year gross profit in the fourth quarter in fiscal 2010, fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008, respectively. Despite the fact that we have experienced a significant amount of our net revenue and gross profit in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year, we believe that the true extent of the seasonality or cyclical nature of our business may have been overshadowed by our rapid growth to date. As our expected growth rate slows, we believe that we will experience fourth quarter gross profits as a percentage of full year gross profits as high, or higher, than in the current year. The level of our working capital reflects the seasonality of our business. We expect inventory, accounts payable and accrued expenses to be higher in the third and fourth quarters in preparation for the holiday selling season. Because our products are sold primarily through our stores, order backlog is not material to our business. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our primary sources of liquidity are our current balances of cash and cash equivalents, cash flows from operations and borrowings available under our revolving credit facility. Our primary cash needs are capital expenditures for opening new stores and remodeling existing stores, making information technology system enhancements and funding working capital requirements. Cash and cash equivalents in excess of our needs are held in interest bearing accounts with financial institutions. As of January 30, 2011, our working capital (excluding cash and cash equivalents) was a deficit of $12.4 million and our cash and cash equivalents were $316.3 million. 42 Table of Contents The following table summarizes our net cash flows provided by and used in operating, investing and financing activities for the periods indicated: Fiscal Year Ended January 30, January 31, February 1, 2011 2010 2009 (In thousands) Total cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 179,995 $ 117,960 $ 46,438 Investing activities (42,839 ) (16,307 ) (46,795 ) Financing activities 13,699 (2,649 ) 13,460 Effect of exchange rate changes 5,858 3,772 (8,851 ) Increase in cash and cash equivalents $ 156,713 $ 102,776 $ 4,252 Operating Activities Operating Activities consist primarily of net income adjusted for certain non-cash items, including depreciation and amortization, deferred income taxes, realized gains and losses on property and equipment, stock-based compensation expense and the effect of the changes in non-cash working capital items, principally accounts receivable, inventories, accounts payable and accrued expenses. In fiscal 2010, cash provided by operating activities increased $62.0 million, to $180.0 million compared to cash provided by operating activities of $118.0 million in fiscal 2009. The $62.0 million increase was primarily a result of increased net income as we expanded our store base, an increase in items not affecting cash and a net decrease in the change in other working capital balances. The net increase in items not affecting cash was primarily due to an increase in depreciation and amortization related to our increased store base, a net decrease in deferred income taxes and an increase in stock-based compensation. The net decrease in the change in other working capital balances was primarily due to an increase in income taxes payable and an increase in other current liabilities resulting from a increased accrued compensation and unredeemed gift card liabilities. Depreciation and amortization relate almost entirely to leasehold improvements, furniture and fixtures, computer hardware and software, equipment and vehicles in our stores and other corporate buildings. Depreciation and amortization increased $3.8 million to $24.6 million in fiscal 2010 from $20.8 million in fiscal 2009. Depreciation for our corporate-owned store segment was $16.3 million, $13.7 million, and $10.6 million in fiscal 2010, fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008, respectively. There was no depreciation for our direct to consumer segment in fiscal 2010, fiscal 2009, and fiscal 2008. Depreciation related to corporate activities was $8.3 million, $7.1 million, and $5.3 million fiscal 2010, fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008, respectively. We have not allocated any depreciation to our other segment as these amounts to date have been immaterial. Investing Activities Investing Activities relate entirely to capital expenditures, investments in and advances to franchises, and acquisitions of franchises. Cash used in investing activities increased $26.5 million, to $42.8 million in fiscal 2010 from $16.3 million in fiscal 2009. This increase in cash used in investing activities represents an increase in the number of new stores opened in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009, as well as our reacquisition of franchised stores in Australia and Canada. Capital expenditures for our corporate-owned stores segment were $14.5 million in fiscal 2010 which included $7.0 million to open 14 corporate-owned stores and $10.2 million in fiscal 2009 which included $4.8 million to open ten corporate-owned stores. The remaining capital expenditures for our corporate-owned stores segment in each period were for ongoing store refurbishment. Capital expenditures for our direct to consumer segment were $4.6 million and $nil in fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009, respectively. Capital expenditures related to corporate activities and administration were $11.2 million and $5.3 million in fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009, respectively. The capital expenditures in each period for corporate activities and administration were for 43 Table of Contents improvements at our head office and other corporate buildings as well as investments in information technology and business systems. Capital expenditures are expected to range between $110.0 million to $115.0 million in fiscal 2011, including approximately $15.0 million to $19.0 million for approximately 25 to 30 new stores and the remainder reflecting the store support center purchase, renovation capital for existing stores, information technology enhancements and other corporate activities. Financing Activities Financing Activities consist primarily of cash received on the exercise of stock options and excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation. Cash provided by financing activities increased $16.3 million, to cash provided of $13.7 million in fiscal 2010 from cash used of $2.6 million in fiscal 2009. We believe that our cash from operations and borrowings available to us under our revolving credit facility will be adequate to meet our liquidity needs and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 24 months. Our cash from operations may be negatively impacted by a decrease in demand for our products as well as the other factors described in “Risk Factors.” In addition, we may make discretionary capital improvements with respect to our stores, distribution facility, headquarters, or other systems, which we would expect to fund through the issuance of debt or equity securities or other external financing sources to the extent we were unable to fund such capital expenditures out of our cash from operations. Revolving Credit Facility In April 2007, we entered into an uncommitted senior secured demand revolving credit facility with Royal Bank of Canada. The revolving credit facility provides us with available borrowings in an amount up to CDN$20.0 million. The revolving credit facility must be repaid in full on demand and is available by way of prime loans in Canadian currency, U.S. base rate loans in U.S. currency, bankers’ acceptances, LIBOR based loans in U.S. currency or Euro currency, letters of credit in Canadian currency or U.S. currency and letters of guaranty in Canadian currency or U.S. currency. The revolving credit facility bears interest on the outstanding balance in accordance with the following: (i) prime rate for prime loans; (ii) U.S. base rate for U.S. based loans; (iii) a fee of 1.125% per annum on bankers’ acceptances; (iv) LIBOR plus 1.125% per annum for LIBOR based loans; (v) a 1.125% annual fee for letters of credit; and (vi) a 1.125% annual fee for letters of guaranty. Both lululemon usa inc. and lululemon FC USA inc., Inc. provided Royal Bank of Canada with guarantees and postponements of claims in the amounts of CDN$20.0 million with respect to lululemon athletica canada inc.’s obligations under the revolving credit facility. The revolving credit facility is also secured by all of our present and after acquired personal property, including all intellectual property and all of the outstanding shares we own in our subsidiaries. As of January 30, 2011, aside from the letters of credit and guarantees, we had $nil in borrowings outstanding under this credit facility. Contractual Obligations and Commitments Leases. We lease certain corporate-owned store locations, storage spaces, building and equipment under non-cancelable operating leases. Our leases generally have initial terms of between five and 10 years, and generally can be extended only in five-year increments, if at all. Our leases expire at various dates between 2011 and 2021, excluding extensions at our option. A substantial number of our leases for corporate-owned store premises include renewal options and certain of our leases include rent escalation clauses, rent holidays and leasehold rental incentives, none of which are reflected in the following table. Most of our leases for corporate-owned store premises also include contingent rental payments based on sales volume, the impact of which also are not reflected in the following table. The following table summarizes our contractual arrangements as of January 30, 2011, and the timing and effect that such commitments are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods: Payments Due by Fiscal Year Total 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Thereafter (In thousands) Operating Leases (minimum rent) $ 248,999 $ 36,958 $ 36,329 $ 35,693 $ 35,277 $ 32,277 $ 72,465 Franchise Agreements. As of January 30, 2011, we operated four stores in the United States through franchise agreements. Under the terms of our franchise agreements, unless otherwise approved by us, franchisees 44 Table of Contents are permitted to sell only lululemon athletica products, are required to purchase their inventory from us, which we sell at a slight premium to our cost, and are required to pay us a royalty based on a percentage of their gross sales. Under some of our franchise agreements, we have the ability to repurchase franchises at a price equal to a specified percentage of trailing 12-month sales. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We enter into documentary letters of credit to facilitate the international purchase of merchandise. We also enter into standby letters of credit to secure certain of our obligations, including insurance programs and duties related to import purchases. As of January 30, 2011, letters of credit and letters of guarantee totaling $1.5 million have been issued. Other than these standby letters of credit, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, investments in special purpose entities or undisclosed borrowings or debt. In addition, we have not entered into any derivative contracts or synthetic leases. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions. Predicting future events is inherently an imprecise activity and, as such, requires the use of judgment. Actual results may vary from estimates in amounts that may be material to the financial statements. An accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically, could materially impact our consolidated financial statements. We believe that the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements: Revenue Recognition. Net revenue is comprised of corporate-owned store net revenue, direct to consumer sales through www.lululemon.com and phone sales, and other net revenue, which includes, franchise royalties as well as sales of products to franchisees, sales to wholesale accounts, warehouse sales and sales from company-operated showrooms, in each case, net of an estimated allowance for sales returns and discounts. Sales to customers through corporate-owned stores and company-operated showrooms are recognized at the point of sale, net of an estimated allowance for sales returns. Direct to consumer sales are recognized when goods are shipped and collection is reasonably assured, net of an estimated allowance for sales returns. Other net revenue related to franchise royalties are recognized when earned, in accordance with the terms of the franchise/license agreements. Royalties are based on a percentage of the franchisees’ sales and recognized when those sales occur. Other net revenue related to warehouse sales is recognized when these sales occur. Amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling are recognized at the time of shipment. Sales are reported on a net revenue basis, which is computed by deducting from our gross sales the amount of sales taxes, actual product returns received, discounts and an amount established for anticipated sales returns. Our estimated allowance for sales returns is a subjective critical estimate that has a direct impact on reported net revenue. This allowance is calculated based on a history of actual returns, estimated future returns and any significant future known or anticipated events. Consideration of these factors results in an estimated allowance for sales returns. Our standard terms for retail sales limit returns to approximately 14 days after the sale of the merchandise. For our wholesale sales, we allow returns from our wholesale customers if properly requested and approved. Employee discounts are classified as a reduction of net revenue. Revenues from our gift cards are recognized when tendered for payment, or upon redemption. Outstanding customer balances are included in “Unredeemed gift card liability” on the consolidated balance sheets. There are no expiration dates on our gift cards, and lululemon does not charge any service fees that cause a decrement to customer balances. While we will continue to honor all gift cards presented for payment, management may determine the likelihood of redemption to be remote for certain card balances due to, among other things, long periods of inactivity. In these circumstances, to the extent management determines there is no requirement for remitting card 45 Table of Contents balances to government agencies under unclaimed property laws, card balances may be recognized in the consolidated statements of operations in “Net revenue.” Accounts Receivable. Accounts receivable primarily arise out of sales to wholesale accounts, sales of products and royalties on sales owed to us by our franchises, and landlord deferred lease inducements. The allowance for doubtful accounts represents management’s best estimate of probable credit losses in accounts receivable. This allowance is established based on the specific circumstances associated with the credit risk of the receivable, the size of the accounts receivable balance, aging of accounts receivable balances and our collection history and other relevant information. The allowance for doubtful accounts is reviewed on a monthly basis. Receivables are charged to the allowance when management believes the account will not be recovered. Inventory. Inventory is valued at the lower of cost and market. Cost is determined using weighted-average costs. For finished goods, market is defined as net realizable value, and for raw materials, market is defined as replacement cost. Cost of inventories includes acquisition and production costs including raw material and labor, as applicable, and all costs incurred to deliver inventory to our distribution centers including freight, non-refundable taxes, duty and other landing costs. We periodically review our inventories and make provisions as necessary to appropriately value obsolete or damaged goods. The amount of the provision is equal to the difference between the book cost of the inventory and its estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demands, selling prices and market conditions. In addition, as part of inventory valuations, we provide for inventory shrinkage based on historical trends from actual physical inventories. Inventory shrinkage estimates are made to reduce the inventory value for lost or stolen items. We perform physical inventory counts throughout the year and adjust the shrink provision accordingly. In fiscal 2010, we wrote-off $1.0 million of inventory and in fiscal 2009 we wrote-off $0.8 million of inventory. Property and Equipment. Property and equipment are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation. Direct internal and external costs related to software used for internal purposes which are incurred during the application development stage or for upgrades that add functionality are capitalized. All other costs related to internal use software are expensed as incurred. Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the lesser of the length of the lease, without consideration of option renewal periods and the estimated useful life of the assets, up to a maximum of five years. All other property and equipment are amortized using the declining balance method as follows: Furniture and fixtures 20 % Computer hardware and software 30 % Equipment and vehicles 30 % We recognize a liability for the fair value of a required asset retirement obligation, or ARO, when such obligation is incurred. Our AROs are primarily associated with leasehold improvements which, at the end of a lease, we are contractually obligated to remove in order to comply with the lease agreement. At the inception of a lease with such conditions, we record an ARO liability and a corresponding capital asset in an amount equal to the estimated fair value of the obligation. The liability is estimated based on a number of assumptions requiring management’s judgment, including store closing costs, cost inflation rates and discount rates, and is accreted to its projected future value over time. The capitalized asset is depreciated using the convention for depreciation of leasehold improvement assets. Upon satisfaction of the ARO conditions, any difference between the recorded ARO liability and the actual retirement costs incurred is recognized as an operating gain or loss in the consolidated statements of operations. We recognize a liability for a cost associated with a lease exit activity when such obligation is incurred. A lease exit activity is measured initially at its fair value in the period in which the liability is incurred. We estimate fair value at the cease-use date of its operating leases as the remaining lease rentals, reduced by estimated sublease rentals that could be reasonably obtained for the property, even where we does not intend to enter into a sublease. Estimating the cost of certain lease exit costs involves subjective assumptions, including the time it would take to sublease the leased location and the related potential sublease income. The estimated accruals for these costs could be significantly affected if future experience differs from that used in the initial estimate. Lease exit costs are included in provision for impairment and lease exit costs. 46 Table of Contents Long-Lived Assets. Long-lived assets, including intangible assets with finite useful lives, held for use are evaluated for impairment when the occurrence of events or changes in circumstances indicates that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable as measured by comparing their net book value to the estimated future cash flows generated by their use and eventual disposition. Impaired assets are recorded at fair value, determined principally by the estimated future cash flows expected from their use and eventual disposition. Reductions in asset values resulting from impairment valuations are recognized in income in the period that the impairment is determined. Long-lived assets, including intangible assets with finite useful lives, held for sale are reported at the lower of the carrying value of the asset and fair value less cost to sell. Any write-downs to reflect fair value less selling cost is recognized in income when the asset is classified as held for sale. Gains or losses on assets held for sale and asset dispositions are included in provision for impairment and lease exit costs. Income Taxes. We follow the liability method with respect to accounting for income taxes. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates that are expected to be in effect when these differences are anticipated to reverse. Deferred income tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance, if based on the weight of available positive and negative evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The recognition of a deferred income tax asset is based upon several assumptions and management forecasts, including current and proposed tax legislation, current and anticipated taxable income, utilization of previously unrealized non-operating loss carry forwards and regulatory reviews of tax filings. Given the judgments and estimates required and the sensitivity of the results to the significant assumptions used, we believe the accounting estimates used in relation to the recognition of deferred income tax assets are subject to measurement uncertainty and are susceptible to a material change if the underlying assumptions change. For financial reporting purposes, we generally provide taxes at the rate applicable for the appropriate tax jurisdiction. Because our present intention is to reinvest the unremitted earnings in our foreign operations, we do not provide U.S. income taxes on unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries. Management periodically assesses the need to utilize these unremitted earnings to finance our foreign operations. This assessment is based on cash flow projections that are the result of estimates of future production, fiscal requirements by tax jurisdiction of our operations and operational and fiscal objectives by tax jurisdiction for our operations. Such estimates are inherently imprecise since many assumptions utilized in the cash flow projections are subject to revision in the future. We file income tax returns in the United States, Canada and various foreign and state jurisdictions. We are subject to income tax examination by tax authorities in all jurisdictions from our inception to date. Our policy is to recognize interest expense and penalties related to income tax matters as tax expense. At January 30, 2011, we do not have any significant accruals for interest related to unrecognized tax benefits or tax penalties. Our intercompany transfer pricing policies will be subject to audits by various foreign tax jurisdictions. Although we believe that our intercompany transfer pricing policies and tax positions are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits or potential tax disputes may be materially different from that which is reflected in our income tax provisions and accruals. Goodwill and Intangible Assets. Intangible assets are recorded at cost. Non-competition agreements are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life of five years. Reacquired franchise rights are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives of 10 years. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair market value of identifiable net assets acquired and is not amortized. Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested for impairment annually or more frequently when an event or circumstance indicates that goodwill or indefinite useful live intangible assets might be impaired. We use our best estimates and judgment based on available evidence in conducting the impairment testing. When the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess of the carrying value over its fair market value. Stock-Based Compensation. We account for stock-based compensation using the fair value method. The fair value of awards granted is estimated at the date of grant and recognized as employee compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period with the offsetting credit to additional paid-in capital. Our calculation of stock-based compensation requires us to make a number of complex and subjective estimates and 47 Table of Contents assumptions, including future forfeitures, stock price volatility, expected life of the options and related tax effects. The estimation of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment, and to the extent actual results differ from our estimates, such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised. We consider several factors when estimating expected forfeitures, such as types of awards, size of option holder group and anticipated employee retention. Actual results may differ substantially from these estimates. Expected volatility of the stock is based on our review of companies we believe of similar growth and maturity and our peer group in the industry in which we do business because we do not have sufficient historical volatility data for our own stock. The expected term of options granted is derived from the output of the option valuation model and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding. In the future, as we gain historical data for volatility in our own stock and the actual term employees hold our options, expected volatility and expected term may change which could substantially change the grant-date fair value of future awards of stock options and, ultimately, the expense we record. For awards with service and/or performance conditions, the total amount of compensation expense to be recognized is based on the number of awards that are expected to vest and is adjusted to reflect those awards that do ultimately vest. For awards with performance conditions, we recognize the compensation expense over the requisite service period as determined by a range of probability weighted outcomes. For awards with market and or performance conditions, all compensation expense is recognized if the underlying market or performance conditions are fulfilled. Certain employees are entitled to share-based awards from one of our principal stockholders. These awards are accounted for as employee compensation expense in accordance with the above noted policies. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In January 2010, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (or FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (or ASU) 2010-06, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures Topic 820: Improving Disclosures about Fair Value Measurements (or ASU 2010-06). ASU 2010-06 requires new disclosures regarding transfers in and out of the Level 1 and 2 and activity within Level 3 fair value measurements and clarifies existing disclosures of inputs and valuation techniques for Level 2 and 3 fair value measurements. The new disclosures and clarifications of existing disclosures are effective for interim and Annual Reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2009, except for the disclosure of activity within Level 3 fair value measurements, which is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2010, and for interim reporting periods within those years. We adopted the new disclosures effective January 31, 2010, except for the disclosure of activity within Level 3 fair value measurements. The Level 3 disclosures are effective for us at the beginning of fiscal 2011. The adoption of ASU 2010-06 did not have a material impact, and is not expected to have a material impact, on the disclosures within our consolidated financial statements. In February 2010, the FASB amended Accounting Standards Codification (or ASC) Topic 855 Subsequent Events (or ASC 855). Under the amended guidance, SEC filers are no longer required to disclose the date through which subsequent events have been evaluated in originally issued and revised financial statements. This guidance was effective immediately and we adopted these new requirements in the first quarter of fiscal 2010. In April 2010, the FASB amended ASC Topic 718 Compensation (or ASC 718) to clarify that a share-based payment award with an exercise price denominated in the currency of a market in which a substantial portion of the entity’s equity securities trades should not be considered to contain a market, performance or service condition. Therefore, an entity should not classify such an award as a liability if it otherwise qualifies for classification in equity. This guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2010 and is to be applied prospectively. We have determined the adoption of the amendment will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates. Our market risk exposure is primarily a result of fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. We do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. Foreign Currency Exchange Risk. We currently generate a significant portion of our net revenue in Canada. The reporting currency for our consolidated financial statements is the U.S. dollar. Historically, our operations were 48 Table of Contents based largely in Canada. As of January 30, 2011, we operated 44 stores in Canada. As a result, we have been impacted by changes in exchange rates and may be impacted materially for the foreseeable future. As we recognize net revenue from sales in Canada in Canadian dollars, and the U.S. dollar has weakened during fiscal 2010, it has had a positive impact on our Canadian operating results upon translation of those results into U.S. dollars for the purposes of consolidation. However, the gain in net revenue was partially offset by higher cost of sales and higher selling, general and administrative expenses that are generated in Canadian dollars. A 10% depreciation in the relative value of the Canadian dollar compared to the U.S. dollar would have resulted in lost income from operations of approximately $11.3 million in fiscal 2010 and approximately $11.2 million in fiscal 2009. To the extent the ratio between our net revenue generated in Canadian dollars increases as compared to our expenses generated in Canadian dollars, we expect that our results of operations will be further impacted by changes in exchange rates. A portion of our net revenue is generated in Australia. A 10% depreciation in the relative value of the Australian dollar compared to the U.S. dollar would have resulted in lost income from operations of approximately $0.1 million in fiscal 2010. We do not currently hedge foreign currency fluctuations. However, in the future, in an effort to mitigate losses associated with these risks, we may at times enter into derivative financial instruments, although we have not historically done so. We do not, and do not intend to, engage in the practice of trading derivative securities for profit. Interest Rate Risk. In April 2007, we entered into an uncommitted senior secured demand revolving credit facility with Royal Bank of Canada. The revolving credit facility provides us with available borrowings in an amount up to CDN$20.0 million. Because our revolving credit facility bears interest at a variable rate, we will be exposed to market risks relating to changes in interest rates, if we have a meaningful outstanding balance. As of January 30, 2011, we had no outstanding borrowings under our revolving facility. We had small outstanding balances under our revolving facility during fiscal 2010 as we built inventory and working capital for the holiday selling season, but we do not believe we are significantly exposed to changes in interest rate risk. We currently do not engage in any interest rate hedging activity and currently have no intention to do so in the foreseeable future. However, in the future, if we have a meaningful outstanding balance under our revolving facility, in an effort to mitigate losses associated with these risks, we may at times enter into derivative financial instruments, although we have not historically done so. These may take the form of forward sales contracts, option contracts, and interest rate swaps. We do not, and do not intend to, engage in the practice of trading derivative securities for profit. Inflation Inflationary factors such as increases in the cost of our product and overhead costs may adversely affect our operating results. Although we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations to date, a high rate of inflation in the future may have an adverse effect on our ability to maintain current levels of gross margin and selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenue if the selling prices of our products do not increase with these increased costs. 49 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 21:53:32.726246
1397187,LULU,lululemon athletica inc.,2012,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS This discussion summarizes our consolidated operating results, financial condition and liquidity during the three-year period ending January 29, 2012. Our fiscal year ends on the Sunday closest to January 31 of the following year, typically resulting in a 52 week year, but occasionally giving rise to an additional week, resulting in a 53 week year. Fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009 ended on January 29, 2012, January 30, 2011 and January 31, 2010, respectively. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements based on current expectations that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions, such as our plans, objectives, expectations and intentions set forth in the “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.” Our actual results and the timing of events may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth in the “Item 1A—Risk Factors” section and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Overview Our results for fiscal 2011 demonstrate the ongoing success of our efforts to overcome the instability in the economy for the last three fiscal years. At the end of last year, we set goals for fiscal 2011 which required continued investment in our stores and our people, making infrastructure enhancements and funding working capital requirements, while remaining conscious of our discretionary spending. These goals included growing revenue year-over-year while maintaining operating margins, as well as positioning the Company for long-term growth. We continually assess the economic environment and market conditions when making decisions regarding timing of our investments. Our investments in our stores and people were reflected in our comparable stores net revenue growth, which leveraged our fixed operating costs and in turn led to increased operating margins. We increased our store base through execution of our real estate strategy, when and where we saw opportunities for success. For example, we opened 41 new corporate-owned stores in North America, Australia, and New Zealand since fiscal 2010, including our remaining four reacquired franchises. Where we find opportunities for growth through opening showrooms, or other community presence efforts, we expect to expand our store base and therefore our business. 12 to 14 of our planned store openings in fiscal 2012 are expected to be in markets seeded by showrooms in fiscal 2012. Throughout fiscal 2011, we were able to grow our e-commerce business which has further increased our brand awareness and has made our product available in new markets, including those outside of North America. This sales channel offers a higher operating margin than our other segments and accounted for 13.5% of total revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 compared to 10.0% of total revenue in the same period of the prior year. Continuing increases in traffic and conversion rates on our e-commerce website lead us to believe that there is potential for our direct to consumer segment to become an increasingly substantial part of our business and we plan to continue to commit a portion of our resources to further developing this channel. We believe that our brand is recognized as premium in our offerings of run and yoga assortment, as well as a leader in technical fabrics and quality construction. This has made our product desirable to our consumers and has driven demand, which we are able to meet given our increased product depth in stores compared to last year. In fiscal 2012, we plan on investing in new and legacy information technology systems to gain further efficiencies in our vertical retail strategy. We also plan on investing in international expansion opportunities where we have determined there is growth opportunity, including adding country-specific e-commerce websites and opening additional international showrooms. We believe our strong cash flow generation, solid balance sheet and healthy liquidity provide us with the financial flexibility to continue executing the initiatives which we believe will be beneficial for us. 25 Table of Contents Operating Segment Overview lululemon is a designer and retailer of technical athletic apparel operating primarily in North America and Australia. Our yoga-inspired apparel is primarily marketed under the lululemon athletica and ivivva athletica brand names. We offer a comprehensive line of apparel and accessories including fitness pants, shorts, tops and jackets designed for athletic pursuits such as yoga, running and general fitness, and dance-inspired apparel for female youth. As of January 29, 2012, our branded apparel was principally sold through 174 corporate-owned and franchise stores that are located in Canada, the United States, Australia and New Zealand and via our e-commerce website through our direct to consumer sales channel. We believe our vertical retail strategy allows us to interact more directly with and gain insights from our customers while providing us with greater control of our brand. In fiscal 2011, 43% of our net revenue was derived from sales of our products in Canada, 53% of our net revenue was derived from the sales of our products in the United States and 4% of our net revenue was derived from sales of our products outside of North America. In fiscal 2010, 52% of our net revenue was derived from sales of our products in Canada, 46% of our net revenue was derived from the sales of our products in the United States and 2% of our net revenue was derived from sales of our products outside of North America. In fiscal 2009, 60% of our net revenue was derived from sales of our products in Canada, 40% of our net revenue was derived from the sales of our products in the United States and an immaterial amount of our net revenue was derived from sales of our products outside of North America. Our net revenue increased from $711.7 million in fiscal 2010 to $1,000.8 million in fiscal 2011, representing a 41% increase. Our increase in net revenue from fiscal 2010 to fiscal 2011 resulted from the net addition of 41 retail locations, including our remaining four reacquired franchises, and comparable store sales growth of 22% in fiscal 2011. Our ability to open new stores and grow sales in existing stores has been driven by increasing demand for our technical athletic apparel and a growing recognition of the lululemon athletica brand. We believe our superior products, strategic store locations, inviting store environment, grassroots marketing approach and distinctive corporate culture are responsible for our strong financial performance. We have three reportable segments: corporate-owned stores, direct to consumer and other. We report our segments based on the financial information we use in managing our businesses. While we receive financial information for each corporate-owned store, we have aggregated all of the corporate-owned stores into one reportable segment due to the similarities in the economic and other characteristics of these stores. Our direct to consumer segment accounted for 11% of our net revenue in fiscal 2011, 8% in fiscal 2010 and 4% in fiscal 2009. Our other segment, consisting of franchise sales, wholesale accounts, sales from company-operated showrooms, warehouse sales and outlets, each accounted for less than 10% of our net revenue in each of fiscal 2011, fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009. We previously reported our franchise channel as an operating segment; however, we reacquired our remaining four franchised stores in fiscal 2011 and opening new franchise stores is not part of our growth strategy. As of January 29, 2012, we sold our products through 174 corporate-owned stores located in Canada, the United States, Australia, and New Zealand. We plan to increase our net revenue in North America and Australia by opening additional corporate-owned stores in new and existing markets. Corporate-owned stores accounted for 82% of total net revenue in fiscal 2011, 83% of total net revenue in fiscal 2010 and 87% of total net revenue in fiscal 2009. As of January 29, 2012, our direct to consumer segment included our e-commerce website. E-commerce sales are taken directly from retail customers through www.lululemon.com. Our direct to consumer segment is an increasingly substantial part of our growth strategy, and now represents more than 10% of our net revenue. In addition to deriving revenue from sales through our corporate-owned stores and direct to consumer, we also derive other net revenue, which includes wholesale customers, as well as franchise sales, warehouse sales and sales through a number of company-operated showrooms. Wholesale customers include select premium yoga studios, health clubs and fitness centers. We reacquired our four remaining franchise stores during fiscal 2011, 26 Table of Contents and as such, franchise sales, which included inventory sales and royalties, will no longer be a part of our other net revenue in future fiscal years. Warehouse sales are typically held one or more times a year to sell slow moving inventory or inventory from prior seasons to retail customers at discounted prices. Our showrooms are typically small locations that we open from time to time when we enter new markets and feature a limited selection of our product offering during select hours. Other net revenue accounted for 7% of total revenue in fiscal 2011, 9% of total net revenue in fiscal 2010 and 9% of total net revenue in fiscal 2009. We believe that our athletic apparel has and will continue to appeal to consumers outside of North America who value its technical attributes as well as its function and style. In 2004, we opened our first store in Australia which was operated under a franchise license. In fiscal 2009 we made a 13% equity investment in lululemon athletica australia Pty, our franchise operator. During fiscal 2010 we increased our investment to 80% which has provided us control over lululemon athletica australia Pty. In fiscal 2008, we opened a company-operated showroom in Hong Kong. In the past, we have entered into franchise agreements to distribute lululemon athletica branded products to more quickly disseminate our brand name and increase our net revenue and net income. In exchange for the use of our brand name and the ability to operate lululemon athletica stores in certain regions, our franchisees generally pay us a one-time franchise fee and ongoing royalties based on their gross revenue. Additionally, unless otherwise approved by us, our franchisees are required to sell only lululemon athletica branded products, which are purchased from us at a discount to the suggested retail price. Pursuing new franchise partnerships or opening new franchise stores is not part of our near-term store growth strategy, and we reacquired our four remaining franchise stores in fiscal 2011. Basis of Presentation Net revenue is comprised of: • corporate-owned store net revenue, which includes sales to customers through corporate-owned stores in North America and Australia; • direct to consumer revenue, which includes sales from our e-commerce website; and • other net revenue, which includes wholesale accounts, franchises net revenue, which consists of royalties as well as sales of our products to franchises, warehouse sales, outlets and sales from company-operated showrooms. in each case, net of an estimated allowance for sales returns and discounts. In addition, we separately track comparable store sales, which reflect net revenue at corporate-owned stores that have been open for at least 12 months. Therefore, net revenue from a store is included in comparable store sales beginning with the first month for which the store has a full month of comparable prior year sales. Non-comparable store sales include sales from new stores that have not been open or otherwise not operated by us for 12 months or from stores which have been significantly remodeled or relocated. Also included in non-comparable stores sales are sales from direct to consumer sales, wholesale, franchises, warehouse sales and showrooms, and sales from corporate-owned stores which we have closed. By measuring the change in year-over-year net revenue in stores that have been open for 12 months or more, comparable store sales allows us to evaluate how our core store base is performing. Various factors affect comparable store sales, including: • the location of new stores relative to existing stores; • consumer preferences, buying trends and overall economic trends; • our ability to anticipate and respond effectively to customer preferences for technical athletic apparel; 27 Table of Contents • competition; • changes in our merchandise mix; • pricing; • the timing of our releases of new merchandise and promotional events; • the effectiveness of our grassroots marketing efforts; • the level of customer service that we provide in our stores; • our ability to source and distribute products efficiently; and • the number of stores we open, close (including for temporary renovations) and expand in any period. Opening new stores is an important part of our growth strategy. Accordingly, comparable store sales has limited utility for assessing the success of our growth strategy insofar as comparable store sales do not reflect the performance of stores open less than 12 months. Cost of goods sold includes: • the cost of purchased merchandise, which includes acquisition and production costs including raw material and labor, as applicable; • the cost incurred to deliver inventory to our distribution centers including freight, non-refundable taxes, duty and other landing costs; • the cost of our distribution centers (such as labor, rent and utilities) and the depreciation and amortization related to our distribution centers; • the cost of our production, merchandise and design departments including salaries, stock-based compensation and benefits, and operating expenses; • the cost of occupancy related to store operations (such as rent and utilities) and the depreciation and amortization related to store-level capital expenditures; • hemming; and • shrink and valuation reserves. Cost of goods sold also may change as we open or close stores because of the resulting change in related occupancy costs. The primary drivers of the costs of individual goods are the costs of raw materials and labor in the countries where we source our merchandise. Selling, general and administrative expenses consist of all operating costs not otherwise included in cost of goods sold and provision for impairment and lease exit costs. Our selling, general and administrative expenses include marketing costs, accounting costs, information technology costs, human resource costs, professional fees, corporate facility costs, corporate and store-level payroll and benefits expenses, stock-based compensation and occupancy, depreciation and amortization expense for all assets other than depreciation and amortization expenses related to store-level capital expenditures and our distribution centers, each of which are included in cost of goods sold. We anticipate that our selling, general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars due to anticipated continued growth of our corporate support staff and store-level employees. Provision for impairment and lease exit costs consists of asset impairments, lease exit and other related costs associated with the relocation of our administrative offices and the closure of one Canadian corporate-owned store in fiscal 2010, as well as management’s evaluation of corporate-owned locations. Also included in prior years are one US corporate-owned store in the first quarter of fiscal 2009 as well as an asset impairment provision based on management’s ongoing evaluation of its portfolio of corporate-owned store locations. Long-lived assets are reviewed at the store-level periodically for impairment or whenever events or changes in 28 Table of Contents circumstances indicate that full recoverability of net assets through future cash flows is in question. Factors used in the evaluation include, but are not limited to, management’s plans for future operations, recent operating results and projected cash flows. Other income (expense), net includes interest earned on our cash balances and our advances to franchise, interest costs associated with our credit facilities and with letters of credit drawn under these facilities for the purchase of merchandise and our share of the operations of our investment in lululemon athletica australia PTY prior to obtaining control in fiscal 2010, including the remeasurement of our investment immediately before obtaining control of the business. We expect to continue to generate interest income to the extent that our cash generated from operations exceeds our cash used for investment. We have maintained relatively small outstanding balances on our credit facilities and expect to continue to do so. Provision for income taxes depends on the statutory tax rates in the countries where we sell our products. Historically we had generated taxable income in Canada and we had generated tax losses in the United States. In fiscal 2010 we earned taxable income in the United States and fully utilized any net operating losses available from prior periods. We anticipate continued growth in the United States and consequently foresee and increase in taxable income reported. We have recorded deferred tax assets in respect of deductible temporary differences of 8.6 million. Several factors have contributed to our effective tax rate fluctuating from prior periods. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2011 was 2.8% higher than the effective rate for fiscal 2010 due primarily to the change in geographic mix of earnings. A larger percentage of our earnings in fiscal 2011 were attributable to operations in the United States, where the statutory tax rate is generally higher than the tax rate on operations outside of the United States. Secondly, in fiscal 2011 we incurred stock based compensation expense of $10.3 million compared to $7.3 million in fiscal 2010, a portion of which were not deductible for tax purposes in Canada and the United States during these periods. Lastly, the Canadian corporate tax rate decreased to 28.7% in fiscal 2011 from 31.6% in fiscal 2010. Our effective tax rate in fiscal 2011 was 36.1%, compared to 33.3% in fiscal 2010 and 33% in fiscal 2009. We anticipate that in the future we may start to sell our products directly to some customers located outside of Canada, the United States, Australia and New Zealand, in which case we would become subject to taxation based on the foreign statutory rates in the countries where these sales take place and our effective tax rate could fluctuate accordingly. 29 Table of Contents Results of Operations The following tables summarize key components of our results of operations for the periods indicated, both in dollars and as a percentage of net revenue: Fiscal Year Ended January 29,2012 January 30,2011 January 31,2010 (In thousands) Consolidated statements of operations: Net revenue $ 1,000,839 $ 711,704 $ 452,898 Cost of goods sold 431,569 316,757 229,812 Gross profit 569,270 394,947 223,086 Operating expenses: Selling, general and administrative expenses 282,312 212,784 136,161 Provision for impairment and lease exit costs — 1,772 379 Income from operations 286,958 180,391 86,546 Other income (expense), net 2,500 2,886 164 Income before provision for income taxes 289,458 183,277 86,710 Provision for income taxes 104,494 61,080 28,429 Net income 184,964 122,197 58,281 Net income attributable to non-controlling interest 901 350 — Net income attributable to lululemon athletica inc. $ 184,063 $ 121,847 $ 58,281 Fiscal Year Ended January 29,2012 January 30,2011 January 31,2010 (% of net revenue) Net revenue 100.0 100.0 100.0 Cost of goods sold 43.1 44.5 50.7 Gross profit 56.9 55.5 49.3 Operating expenses: Selling, general and administrative expenses 28.2 29.9 30.1 Provision for impairment and lease exit costs — 0.2 0.1 Income from operations 28.7 25.4 19.1 Other income (expense), net 0.2 0.4 0.1 Income before provision for income taxes 28.9 25.8 19.2 Provision for income taxes 10.4 8.6 6.3 Net income 18.5 17.2 12.9 Net income attributable to non-controlling interest 0.1 0.1 — Net income attributable to lululemon athletica inc. 18.4 17.1 12.9 Comparison of Fiscal 2011 to Fiscal 2010 Net Revenue Net revenue increased $289.1 million, or 41%, to $1,000.8 million in fiscal 2011 from $711.7 million in fiscal 2010. Assuming the average exchange rate between the Canadian and United States dollars and the Australian and United States dollars in fiscal 2010 remained constant, our net revenue would have increased $274.7 million, or 39%, in fiscal 2011. 30 Table of Contents The net revenue increase was driven by increased sales at locations in our comparable stores base, sales from new stores opened, sales from franchised stores that were reacquired during fiscal 2011 and the growth of our direct to consumer segment. The constant dollar increase in comparable store sales was driven primarily by the strength of our existing product lines, successful introduction of new products and increasing recognition of the lululemon athletica brand name, especially at our U.S. stores. Our net revenue on a segment basis for fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010 are expressed in dollar amounts as well as relevant percentages, presented as a percentage of total net revenue below. Fiscal Year Ended January 29, 2012 andJanuary 30, 2011 2011 2010 2011 2010 (In thousands) (Percentages) Corporate-owned stores $ 817,318 $ 591,031 81.7 83.0 Direct to consumer 106,313 57,348 10.6 8.1 Other 77,208 63,325 7.7 8.9 Net revenue $ 1,000,839 $ 711,704 100.0 100.0 Corporate-Owned Stores. Net revenue from our corporate-owned stores segment increased $226.3 million, or 38%, to $817.3 million in fiscal 2011 from $591.0 million in fiscal 2010. The following contributed to the increase in net revenue from our corporate-owned stores segment: • Comparable store sales increase of 22% in fiscal 2011 resulted in a $125.2 million increase to net revenue, including the effect of foreign currency fluctuations. Excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations, comparable store sales increased 20%, or $114.2 million, in fiscal 2011; • Net revenue from corporate-owned stores we opened during fiscal 2011, and during fiscal 2010 prior to sales from such stores becoming part of our comparable stores base, contributed $94.6 million of the increase. Net new store openings in fiscal 2011 included three stores in Canada, 26 stores in the United States, seven in Australia, and one in New Zealand; and • The reacquisition of four U.S. franchise stores in fiscal 2011 contributed $6.5 million of the increase. Direct to Consumer. Net revenue from our direct to consumer segment increased $49.0 million, or 85%, to $106.3 million in fiscal 2011 from $57.3 million in fiscal 2010. The increase in net revenue from our direct to consumer segment was a result of increasing traffic, conversion rates, and average order value on our e-commerce website. Other. Net revenue from our other segment increased $13.9 million, or 22%, to $77.2 million in fiscal 2011 from $63.3 million in fiscal 2010. The increase was a result of increasing net revenue across most of our sales channels included in our other segment: wholesales, showrooms, warehouse sales and outlets. Net revenue from our franchise channel decreased due to the reacquisition of our remaining four remaining franchise stores in the United States, now included in our corporate-owned stores segment. Our other segment continues to grow year over year through new showroom locations, new wholesale partners and net revenue growth at existing locations attributable to a strong product offering and brand interest. We continue to employ our other segment strategy to increase interest in our product in markets we may have corporate-owned stores. Gross Profit Gross profit increased $174.3 million, or 44%, to $569.3 million in fiscal 2011 from $394.9 million in fiscal 2010. Increased net revenue as well as a strengthening Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar improved product margin in all of our operating segments, and ultimately resulted in an increased gross profit. 31 Table of Contents The increase in gross profit was partially offset by increases in fixed costs, such as occupancy costs and depreciation, as well as increased costs related to our design, production, distribution and merchandising departments. Gross profit, as a percentage of net revenue, or gross margin, increased 140 basis points, to 56.9% in fiscal 2011 from 55.5% in fiscal 2010. The increase in gross margin resulted primarily from: • a decrease in fixed costs, such as occupancy costs and depreciation, relative to the increase in net revenue, which had a leveraging effect on gross margin and contributed to an increase in gross margin of 80 basis points; • strengthening of the Canadian and Australian dollars, relative to the U.S. dollar, decreased foreign exchange impacts on product costs and contributed to an increase in gross margin of 70 basis points; and • a decrease in expenses related to our product and supply chain departments, relative to the increase in net revenue, which had a leveraging effect on gross margin and contributed to an increase in gross margin of 10 basis points. The increase in gross margin was partially offset by a decrease in product margins, which contributed to a decrease in gross margin of 20 basis points. This was primarily a result of product cost pressures from raw materials and labour costs which were partially offset by strong sell through of merchandise with fewer markdowns and discounts than in fiscal 2010. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses, including provision for impairment and lease exit costs, increased $67.8 million, or 32%, to $282.3 million in fiscal 2011 from $214.6 million in fiscal 2010. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was principally comprised of: • an increase in employee costs of $29.1 million as we experience natural growth in labor hours associated with new and existing corporate-owned stores, outlets and other, as well as an increase in wages as we invest in our employees; • an increase in head office employee costs, including stock-based compensation expense and management incentive-based compensation, of $15.4 million incurred in order to position us for long-term growth; • an increase in other head office costs of $12.4 million as a result of the expansion of our business; • an increase in other costs, including occupancy costs and depreciation not included in cost of goods sold, of $7.0 million associated with new and existing corporate-owned stores, outlets and other; • an increase in variable store costs of $6.7 million as a result of increased sales volume from new and existing corporate-owned stores, outlets and other; and • an increase in administrative costs of $3.3 million related to our Australian business, in which we increased our investment significantly in the second quarter of fiscal 2010, which we now report on a consolidated basis. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was partially offset by a decrease in administrative costs of $6.1 million related to our direct to consumer segment. This decrease was primarily associated with a reduction in professional fees resulting from bringing our e-commerce operations in-house in the first half of fiscal 2011, offset by higher costs associated with volume growth in this channel. As a percentage of net revenue, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 190 basis points, to 28.2% in fiscal 2011 from 30.1% in fiscal 2010. 32 Table of Contents We expect selling, general and administrative expenses to increase throughout fiscal 2012 as we add administrative and sales personnel and increase our infrastructure to support the growth in our store base. Income from Operations Income from operations increased $106.6 million, or 59%, to $287.0 million in fiscal 2011 from $180.4 million in fiscal 2010. The increase was a result of increased gross profit of $174.3 million, partially offset by increased selling, general and administrative costs of $67.8 million. The increase in selling, general and administrative costs was primarily driven by the increase in our business, as seen in our net revenue increases. On a segment basis, we determine income from operations without taking into account our general corporate expenses. We have reviewed our general corporate expenses and determined some costs previously classified as general corporate are direct segment expenses. Accordingly, all prior year comparable information has be reclassified to conform to the current year classification. Income from operations (before general corporate expenses) for fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010 are expressed in dollar amounts as well as percentages, presented as a percentage of net revenue of their respective operating segments below. Fiscal Year Ended January 29, 2012 andJanuary 30, 2011 2011 2010 2011 2010 (In thousands) (Percentages) Corporate-owned stores $ 298,974 $ 207,992 36.6 35.2 Direct to consumer 44,168 14,016 41.5 24.4 Other 21,225 17,059 27.5 26.9 Income from operations before general corporate expense $ 364,367 $ 239,067 Corporate-Owned Stores. Net income from our corporate-owned stores segment increased $91.0 million, or 44%, to $299.0 million for fiscal 2011 from $208.0 million for fiscal 2010 primarily due to an increase of $137.2 million in gross profit, which was offset partially by a natural increase in selling, general and administrative expenses related to employee costs as well as operating expenses associated with new stores and net revenue growth at existing stores. Income from operations as a percentage of corporate-owned stores revenue increased by 140 basis points primarily from leverage gained over fixed costs. Direct to consumer. Net income from our direct to consumer segment increased $30.2 million, or 215%, to $44.2 million in fiscal 2011 from $14.0 million in fiscal 2010 due to increasing traffic and conversion rates on our e-commerce website. Income from operations as a percentage of direct to consumer revenue increased by 1710 basis points in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 due to decreased professional fees paid as our e-commerce operations were brought in-house near the beginning of fiscal 2011. We discontinued our phone sales channel during fiscal 2011, and therefore our direct to consumer segment will only include e-commerce sales in future fiscal years. Other. Net income from our other segment increased $4.2 million, or 24%, to $21.2 million in fiscal 2011 from $17.1 million in fiscal 2010. This increase was primarily the result of temporary locations open in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 and additional warehouse sales held during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010. This increase was also a result of increased income from strategic sales, showrooms and outlets, partially offset by decreased income from our franchise operating channel. We reacquired our four remaining franchised locations during the third quarter of fiscal 2011; as a result, income from operations from the reacquired stores is now included in our corporate-owned stores segment. We continue to employ our other segment strategy to increase interest in our product in markets we have not otherwise entered with corporate-owned stores. Income from operations also includes general corporate expenses. General corporate expenses increased $18.7 million, or 32%, to $77.4 million in fiscal 2011 from $58.7 million in fiscal 2010. This increase was 33 Table of Contents primarily due to an increase in expenses related to our head office growth of $14.8 million, which was largely related to the growth of our information technology and human resources departments to support the growth of our business. Income from operations also increased as a result of increased stock-based compensation expense of $2.2 million, an increase in foreign exchange losses of $1.2 million, and increased depreciation and amortization expense of $0.5 million. The increase was partially offset by a decreased provision for impairment and lease exit costs of $1.8 million. General corporate expenses are expected to continue to increase in future years as we grow our overall business and require increased efforts at our head office to support our corporate-owned stores, franchises and other segments. Other Income (Expense), Net Other income (expense), net decreased $0.4 million, to $2.5 million in fiscal 2011 from $2.9 million in fiscal 2010. The decrease was primarily a result of re-measuring our 13 percent non-controlling equity investment in Australia immediately prior to obtaining control of the business, which led to a $1.8 million gain on investment in fiscal 2010. This was offset by increased interest income earned in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 on our increased cash balances. Provision for Income Taxes Provision for income taxes increased $43.4 million, or 71%, to $104.5 million in fiscal 2011 from $61.1 million in fiscal 2010. In fiscal 2011, our effective tax rate was 36.1% compared to 33.3% in fiscal 2010. The higher effective tax rate was due to the proportional increase of taxable income in the United States in fiscal 2011 compared to taxable income in Canada which is taxed at a rate lower than the US statutory rate combined with the declining Canadian corporate tax rate. We expect this trend to continue as we expect to generate a higher proportion of our future taxable income in the United States. We have not recorded deferred taxes on undistributed earnings and other temporary differences of our Canadian subsidiary which are considered to be indefinitely reinvested. If management’s intentions with respect to these undistributed earnings and other temporary differences were to change in the future, deferred taxes may need to be provided that could materially impact our financial results. Net Income Net income increased $62.2 million, or 51%, to $184.1 million in fiscal 2011 from $121.8 million in fiscal 2010. The increase in net income in fiscal 2011 was primarily due to a $174.3 million increase in gross profit resulting from sales growth at existing and additional corporate-owned stores opened during fiscal 2011 and increasing traffic on our e-commerce website, offset by an increase of $67.8 million in selling, general and administrative expenses, including provision for impairment and lease exit costs, an increase of $43.4 million in provision for income taxes, and a $0.4 million decrease in other income (expense), net. Comparison of Fiscal 2010 to Fiscal 2009 Net Revenue Net revenue increased $258.8 million, or 57%, to $711.7 million in fiscal 2010 from $452.9 million in fiscal 2009. Assuming the average exchange rate between the Canadian and United States dollars in fiscal 2009 remained constant, our net revenue would have increased $229.6 million, or 51%, in fiscal 2010. The net revenue increase was driven by increased sales at locations in our comparable stores base, sales from new stores and showrooms opened, sales from franchised stores that were reacquired during fiscal 2010 and the growth of our e-commerce website sales included in our direct to consumer segment. The constant dollar increase in comparable store sales was driven primarily by the strength of our existing product lines, the successful introduction of new products and increasing recognition of the lululemon athletica brand name, especially at our U.S. stores. 34 Table of Contents Our net revenue on a segment basis for fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009 are expressed in dollar amounts as well as relevant percentages, presented as a percentage of total net revenue below. Fiscal Year Ended January 30, 2011 andJanuary 31, 2010 2010 2009 2010 2009 (In thousands) (Percentages) Corporate-owned stores $ 591,031 $ 393,451 83.0 86.9 Direct to consumer 57,348 18,257 8.1 4.0 Other 63,325 41,190 8.9 9.1 Net revenue $ 711,704 $ 452,898 100.0 100.0 Corporate-Owned Stores. Net revenue from our corporate-owned stores segment increased $197.6 million, or 50%, to $591.0 million in fiscal 2010 from $393.5 million in fiscal 2009. The following contributed to the $196.9 million increase in net revenue from our corporate-owned stores segment: • Comparable store sales increase of 37% in fiscal 2010 resulted in a $136.1 million increase to net revenue, including the effect of foreign currency fluctuations. Excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations, comparable store sales increased 30%, or $112.2 million, in fiscal 2010; • Net revenue from corporate-owned stores we opened during fiscal 2010, and during fiscal 2009 prior to sales from such stores becoming part of our comparable stores base, contributed $42.3 million of the increase. Net new store openings in fiscal 2010 included 12 stores in the United States and two in Australia; and • The acquisition of one Canadian and nine Australian franchise stores in fiscal 2010 contributed $20.4 million of the increase. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in net revenue related to gift card breakage. In fiscal 2009 we recorded a one-time credit of $1.3 million related to a change in our estimated rate of redemption. Direct to Consumer. Net revenue from our direct to consumer segment increased $39.1 million, or 214%, to $57.3 million in fiscal 2010 from $18.3 million in fiscal 2009. The increase in net revenue from our direct to consumer segment was a result of increasing traffic and conversion rates on our e-commerce website since it launched near the beginning of fiscal 2009. Prior to the launch of our e-commerce website, our direct to consumer segment consisted only of phone sales, and ultimately resulted in an increased gross profit. Other. Net revenue from our other segment increased $22.1 million, or 54%, to $63.3 million in fiscal 2010 from $41.2 million in fiscal 2009. There were increases in net revenue across most of our sales channels included in our other segment: wholesale, showrooms, warehouse sales and outlets. Net revenue from our franchise channel decreased due to our reacquisition of one franchised store in Canada and nine franchised stores in Australia. Our other segment continues to grow year over year through new showroom locations, new wholesale partners and net revenue growth at existing locations attributable to a strong product offering and brand interest. We continue to employ our other segment strategy to increase interest in our product in markets we have not otherwise entered with corporate-owned stores. Gross Profit Gross profit increased 171.9 million, or 77%, to 394.9 million in fiscal 2010 from $223.1 million in fiscal 2009. The increase in gross profit was driven principally by increased net revenue as well as a strengthening Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar, which improved product margin in all of our operating segments, and ultimately resulted in an increased gross profit. 35 Table of Contents The increase in gross profit was partially offset by increases in fixed costs, such as occupancy costs and depreciation, as well as increased costs related to our design, production, distribution and merchandising departments. Gross profit, as a percentage of net revenue, or gross margin, increased 620 basis points, to 55.5% in fiscal 2010 from 49.3% in fiscal 2009. The increase in gross margin resulted primarily from: • a decrease in fixed costs, such as occupancy costs and depreciation, relative to the increase in net revenue, which had a leveraging effect on gross margin and contributed to an increase in gross margin of 250 basis points; • an increase in product margins in corporate-owned stores, direct to consumer and other segments, which contributed to an increase in gross margin of 180 basis points primarily as a result of improved product costing on our spring, summer, and fall assortment of merchandise and a higher proportion of total sales coming from our direct to consumer segment; • strengthening of the Canadian dollar, relative to the U.S. dollar, decreased foreign exchange impacts on product costs and contributed to an increase in gross margin of 140 basis points; and • a decrease in costs related to design, production, distribution and merchandising, relative to the increase in net revenue, which had a leveraging effect on gross margin and contributed to an increase in gross margin of 50 basis points. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses, including provision for impairment and lease exit costs, increased $78.0 million, or 57%, to $214.6 million in fiscal 2010 from $136.5 million in fiscal 2009. The $78.0 million increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was principally comprised of: • an increase in employee costs of $24.8 million as we experience natural growth in labor hours associated with new corporate-owned stores, showrooms, outlets and other, and growth at existing locations; • an increase in variable administrative costs of $18.4 million related to our direct to consumer segment, primarily associated with revenue growth in our e-commerce website sales channel; • an increase in other costs, including occupancy costs, depreciation, distribution and provision for impairment and lease exist costs not included in cost of goods sold, of $14.5 million as a result of the expansion of our business; • an increase in head office employee costs, including stock-based compensation expense and management incentive-based compensation, of $9.6 million incurred in order to position us for long-term growth; • an increase in administrative costs of $6.5 million related to our Australian business, in which we increased our investment significantly in the second quarter of fiscal 2010, which we now report on a consolidated basis; • an increase in marketing efforts, including initiatives associated with the Olympic games, of $3.3 million to increase our brand awareness in both new and existing markets; and • an increase in professional fees of $0.9 million which includes consulting fees for recruiting, store development and information systems, legal fees associated with reacquisition of franchise rights, and employment matters. As a percentage of net revenue, selling, general and administrative expenses were 30.1% in both fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009. 36 Table of Contents We expect selling, general and administrative expenses to increase throughout fiscal 2011 as we add administrative and sales personnel and increase our infrastructure to support the growth in our store base and invest in our e-commerce website. Income from Operations Income from operations increased $93.8 million, or 108%, to $180.4 million in fiscal 2010 from $86.5 million in fiscal 2009. The increase of $93.8 million in income from operations for fiscal 2010 was primarily due to a $171.9 million increase in gross profit resulting from sales growth at existing and additional corporate-owned stores opened during fiscal 2010 and increasing traffic on our e-commerce website, offset by an increase of $78.0 million in selling, general and administrative expenses, including provision for impairment and lease exit costs. On a segment basis, we determine income from operations without taking into account our general corporate expenses. We have reviewed our general corporate expenses and determined some costs previously classified as general corporate are direct segment expenses. Accordingly, all prior year comparable information has be reclassified to conform to the current year classification. Income from operations (before general corporate expenses) for fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009 are expressed in dollar amounts as well as percentages, presented as a percentage of net revenue of their respective operating segments below. Fiscal Year Ended January 30, 2011 andJanuary 31, 2010 2010 2009 2010 2009 (In thousands) (Percentages) Corporate-owned stores $ 207,992 $ 113,428 35.2 28.8 Direct to consumer 14,016 5,394 24.4 29.5 Other 17,059 10,583 26.9 25.7 Income from operations before general corporate expense $ 239,067 $ 129,405 Corporate-Owned Stores. Net income from our corporate-owned stores segment increased $94.6 million, or 83%, to $208.0 million for fiscal 2010 from $113.4 million for fiscal 2009 primarily due to an increase of $127.9 million in gross profit, which was offset partially by a natural increase in selling, general and administrative expenses related to employee costs as well as operating expenses associated with new stores and net revenue growth at existing stores. Direct to consumer. Net income from our direct to consumer segment increased $8.6 million, or 160%, to $14.0 million in fiscal 2010 from $5.4 million in fiscal 2009. Prior to the launch of our e-commerce website, our direct to consumer segment consisted only of phone sales. The addition of our e-commerce website near the beginning of fiscal 2009 has driven the increase in income from operations for our direct to consumer segment. Income from operations as a percentage of direct to consumer revenue decreased in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 due to the introduction of promotional shipping and increased costs related to our digital strategy associated with this selling channel. Other. Net income from our other segment increased $6.5 million, or 61%, to $17.1 million in fiscal 2010 from $10.6 million in fiscal 2009. Gross profit related to our other segment increased in fiscal 2010 from fiscal 2009 primarily due to a higher proportion of full margin sales channels in the current year, such as our showroom sales channel, than in the prior year. There was an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses as a result of opening and operating an increased number of showrooms in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009, which offset a portion of the gross profit increase. 37 Table of Contents Income from operations also includes general corporate expenses. General corporate expenses increased $15.8 million, or 37%, to $58.7 million in fiscal 2010 from $42.9 million in fiscal 2009 primarily due to an increase in expenses related to our head office growth of $12.1 million, as well as increased depreciation and amortization expense of $1.6 million, increased stock-based compensation expense of $1.0 million and increased provision for impairment and lease exist costs of $1.4 million. The increase was partially offset by increases in realized foreign exchange gains of $0.3 million. General corporate expenses are expected to continue to increase in future years as we grow our overall business and require increased efforts at our head office to support our corporate-owned stores, franchises and other segments. Our $1.8 million provision for impairment and lease exit costs was a result of management’s review of our portfolio of corporate-owned store locations and the relocation of our administrative offices. In conjunction with our ongoing evaluation to ensure that each of our corporate-owned stores fit into our long-term growth strategy, we closed two of our corporate-owned stores in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010. We recorded a $0.7 million provision for impairment and lease exit costs related to the two fiscal 2010 closures, and a $0.9 million provision for impairment and lease exit costs related to the relocation of our administrative offices. We also closed one of our corporate-owned stores in the first quarter of fiscal 2009; this closure was fully accrued in fiscal 2008. The fair market values were estimated using an expected present value technique. Other Income (Expense), Net Other income (expense), net increased $2.7 million, to $2.9 million in fiscal 2010 from $0.2 million in fiscal 2009. The increase was primarily a result of re-measuring our 13 percent non-controlling equity investment in Australia immediately prior to obtaining control of the business, which led to a $1.8 million gain on investment. Additionally, we earned more interest income in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 on our increased cash balances. Provision for Income Taxes Provision for income taxes increased $32.7 million, or 115%, to $61.1 million in fiscal 2010 from $28.4 million in fiscal 2009. In fiscal 2010, our effective tax rate was 33.3% compared to 32.8% in fiscal 2009. The higher effective tax rate was due to the proportional increase of taxable income in the United States in fiscal 2010 compared to taxable income in Canada which is taxed at a rate lower than the US statutory rate combined with the declining Canadian Corporate tax rate. We expect this trend to continue as we expect to generate a higher proportion of our future taxable income in the United States. We have not recorded deferred taxes on undistributed earnings and other temporary differences of our Canadian subsidiary which are considered to be indefinitely reinvested. If management’s intentions with respect to these undistributed earnings and other temporary differences were to change in the future, deferred taxes may need to be provided that could materially impact our financial results. Net Income Net income increased $63.6 million, or 109%, to $121.8 million in fiscal 2010 from $58.3 million in fiscal 2009. The increase in net income of $63.6 million in fiscal 2010 was primarily due to a $171.9 million increase in gross profit resulting from sales growth at existing and additional corporate-owned stores opened during fiscal 2010 and increasing traffic on our e-commerce website, and a $2.7 million increase in other income (expense), net, offset by an increase of $78.0 million in selling, general and administrative expenses, including provision for impairment and lease exist costs, and an increase of $32.7 million in provision for income taxes. Seasonality In fiscal 2011, fiscal 2010, and fiscal 2009, we recognized a significant amount of our net revenue in the fourth quarter due to significant increases in sales during the holiday season. We recognized 37%, 36%, and 39% 38 Table of Contents of our full year gross profit in the fourth quarter in fiscal 2011, fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009, respectively. Despite the fact that we have experienced a significant amount of our net revenue and gross profit in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year, we believe that the true extent of the seasonality or cyclical nature of our business may have been overshadowed by our rapid growth to date. As our expected growth rate slows, we believe that we will experience fourth quarter gross profits as a percentage of full year gross profits as high, or higher, than in the current year. The level of our working capital reflects the seasonality of our business. We expect inventory, accounts payable and accrued expenses to be higher in the third and fourth quarters in preparation for the holiday selling season. Because our products are sold primarily through our stores, order backlog is not material to our business. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our primary sources of liquidity are our current balances of cash and cash equivalents, cash flows from operations and borrowings available under our revolving credit facility. Our primary cash needs are capital expenditures for opening new stores and remodeling existing stores, making information technology system enhancements and funding working capital requirements. Cash and cash equivalents in excess of our needs are held in interest bearing accounts with financial institutions. As of January 29, 2012, our working capital (excluding cash and cash equivalents) was $3.6 million and our cash and cash equivalents were $409.4 million. The following table summarizes our net cash flows provided by and used in operating, investing and financing activities for the periods indicated: Fiscal Year Ended January 29,2012 January 30,2011 January 31,2010 (In thousands) Total cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 203,615 $ 179,995 $ 117,960 Investing activities (122,311 ) (42,839 ) (16,307 ) Financing activities 15,364 13,699 (2,649 ) Effect of exchange rate changes (3,517 ) 5,858 3,772 Increase in cash and cash equivalents $ 93,151 $ 156,713 $ 102,776 Operating Activities Operating Activities consist primarily of net income adjusted for certain non-cash items, including depreciation and amortization, deferred income taxes, realized gains and losses on disposal of property and equipment, stock-based compensation expense and the effect of the changes in non-cash working capital items, principally accounts receivable, inventories, accounts payable and accrued expenses. In fiscal 2011, cash provided by operating activities increased $23.6 million, to $203.6 million compared to cash provided by operating activities of $180.0 million in fiscal 2010. The increase was primarily a result of increased net income, an increase in items not affecting cash, and an increase in accrued liabilities, offset by increased inventory purchases. The net increase in items not affecting cash was primarily due to an increase in depreciation and amortization related to our increased store base, and an increase in stock-based compensation. The increase in accrued liabilities was primarily a result of increased sales tax collected as a result of our increased sales. Depreciation and amortization relate almost entirely to leasehold improvements, furniture and fixtures, computer hardware and software, equipment and vehicles in our stores and other corporate buildings. 39 Table of Contents Depreciation and amortization increased $5.6 million to $30.3 million in fiscal 2011 from $24.6 million in fiscal 2010. Depreciation for our corporate-owned store segment was $18.5 million, $15.6 million, and $13.5 million in fiscal 2011, fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009, respectively. Depreciation for our direct to consumer segment was $2.4 million, $0.2 million and $0.2 million in fiscal 2011, fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009, respectively. Depreciation related to corporate activities was $9.4 million, $8.8 million, and $7.2 million fiscal 2011, fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009, respectively. We have not allocated any depreciation to our other segment as these amounts to date have been immaterial. Investing Activities Investing Activities relate entirely to capital expenditures, investments in and advances to franchises, and acquisitions of franchises. Cash used in investing activities increased $79.5 million, to $122.3 million in fiscal 2011 from $42.8 million in fiscal 2010. This increase in cash used in investing activities represents an increase in the number of new stores opened in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010, as well as our reacquisition of our remaining four franchised stores. Capital expenditures for our corporate-owned stores segment were $34.1 million in fiscal 2011 which included $21.9 million to open 41 corporate-owned stores and $14.5 million in fiscal 2010 which included $7.0 million to open 14 corporate-owned stores. The remaining capital expenditures for our corporate-owned stores segment in each period were for ongoing store refurbishment. Capital expenditures for our direct to consumer segment were $6.7 million and $4.6 in fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010, respectively. Capital expenditures related to corporate activities and administration were $76.1 million and $11.2 million in fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010, respectively. The increase in capital expenditures related to corporate activities and administration compared to fiscal 2010 was primarily due to the purchase of our principal executive and administrative offices for $65.1 million plus acquisition-related costs. The capital expenditures in each period for corporate activities and administration were for improvements at our head office and other corporate buildings as well as investments in information technology and business systems. Capital expenditures are expected to range between $70 million to $75 million in fiscal 2012, including approximately $25 million for approximately 37 new stores and the remainder reflecting renovation capital for existing stores, information technology enhancements and other corporate activities. Financing Activities Financing Activities consist primarily of cash received on the exercise of stock options and excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation. Cash provided by financing activities increased $1.7 million, to cash provided of $15.4 million in fiscal 2011 from cash used of $13.7 million in fiscal 2010. We believe that our cash from operations and borrowings available to us under our revolving credit facility will be adequate to meet our liquidity needs and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 24 months. Our cash from operations may be negatively impacted by a decrease in demand for our products as well as the other factors described in “Risk Factors.” In addition, we may make discretionary capital improvements with respect to our stores, distribution facility, headquarters, or other systems, which we would expect to fund through the issuance of debt or equity securities or other external financing sources to the extent we were unable to fund such capital expenditures out of our cash from operations. Revolving Credit Facility In April 2007, we entered into an uncommitted senior secured demand revolving credit facility with Royal Bank of Canada. The revolving credit facility provides us with available borrowings in an amount up to CDN$20.0 million. The revolving credit facility must be repaid in full on demand and is available by way of prime loans in Canadian currency, U.S. base rate loans in U.S. currency, bankers’ acceptances, LIBOR based loans in U.S. currency or Euro currency, letters of credit in Canadian currency or U.S. currency and letters of 40 Table of Contents guaranty in Canadian currency or U.S. currency. The revolving credit facility bears interest on the outstanding balance in accordance with the following: (i) prime rate for prime loans; (ii) U.S. base rate for U.S. based loans; (iii) a fee of 1.125% per annum on bankers’ acceptances; (iv) LIBOR plus 1.125% per annum for LIBOR based loans; (v) a 1.125% annual fee for letters of credit; and (vi) a 1.125% annual fee for letters of guaranty. Both lululemon usa inc. and lululemon FC USA inc., Inc. provided Royal Bank of Canada with guarantees and postponements of claims in the amounts of CDN$20.0 million with respect to lululemon athletica canada inc.’s obligations under the revolving credit facility. The revolving credit facility is also secured by all of our present and after acquired personal property, including all intellectual property and all of the outstanding shares we own in our subsidiaries. As of January 29, 2012, aside from the letters of credit and guarantees, we had $nil in borrowings outstanding under this credit facility. Contractual Obligations and Commitments Leases. We lease certain corporate-owned store locations, storage spaces, building and equipment under non-cancelable operating leases. Our leases generally have initial terms of between five and 10 years, and generally can be extended only in five-year increments, if at all. Our leases expire at various dates between 2011 and 2021, excluding extensions at our option. A substantial number of our leases for corporate-owned store premises include renewal options and certain of our leases include rent escalation clauses, rent holidays and leasehold rental incentives, none of which are reflected in the following table. Most of our leases for corporate-owned store premises also include contingent rental payments based on sales volume, the impact of which also are not reflected in the following table. The following table summarizes our contractual arrangements as of January 29, 2012, and the timing and effect that such commitments are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods: Payments Due by Fiscal Year Total 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Thereafter (In thousands) Operating Leases (minimum rent) $ 270,783 $ 46,020 $ 45,569 $ 44,915 $ 41,847 $ 37,129 $ 55,303 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We enter into documentary letters of credit to facilitate the international purchase of merchandise. We also enter into standby letters of credit to secure certain of our obligations, including insurance programs and duties related to import purchases. As of January 29, 2012, letters of credit and letters of guarantee totaling $1.5 million have been issued. Other than these standby letters of credit, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, investments in special purpose entities or undisclosed borrowings or debt. In addition, we have not entered into any derivative contracts or synthetic leases. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions. Predicting future events is inherently an imprecise activity and, as such, requires the use of judgment. Actual results may vary from estimates in amounts that may be material to the financial statements. An accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically, could materially impact our consolidated financial statements. 41 Table of Contents We believe that the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements: Revenue Recognition. Net revenue is comprised of corporate-owned store net revenue, direct to consumer sales through www.lululemon.com, and other net revenue, which includes, franchise royalties as well as sales of products to franchisees, sales to wholesale accounts, warehouse sales and sales from company-operated showrooms, in each case, net of an estimated allowance for sales returns and discounts. Sales to customers through corporate-owned stores and company-operated showrooms are recognized at the point of sale, net of an estimated allowance for sales returns. Direct to consumer sales are recognized when goods are shipped and collection is reasonably assured, net of an estimated allowance for sales returns. Other net revenue related to franchise royalties are recognized when earned, in accordance with the terms of the franchise/license agreements. Royalties are based on a percentage of the franchisees’ sales and recognized when those sales occur. Other net revenue related to warehouse sales is recognized when these sales occur. Amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling are recognized at the time of shipment. Sales are reported on a net revenue basis, which is computed by deducting from our gross sales the amount of sales taxes, actual product returns received, discounts and an amount established for anticipated sales returns. Our estimated allowance for sales returns is a subjective critical estimate that has a direct impact on reported net revenue. This allowance is calculated based on a history of actual returns, estimated future returns and any significant future known or anticipated events. Consideration of these factors results in an estimated allowance for sales returns. Our standard terms for retail sales limit returns to approximately 14 days after the sale of the merchandise. For our wholesale sales, we allow returns from our wholesale customers if properly requested and approved. Employee discounts are classified as a reduction of net revenue. Revenue from our gift cards are recognized when tendered for payment, or upon redemption. Outstanding customer balances are included in “Unredeemed gift card liability” on the consolidated balance sheets. There are no expiration dates on our gift cards, and lululemon does not charge any service fees that cause a decrement to customer balances. While we will continue to honor all gift cards presented for payment, management may determine the likelihood of redemption to be remote for certain card balances due to, among other things, long periods of inactivity. In these circumstances, to the extent management determines there is no requirement for remitting card balances to government agencies under unclaimed property laws, card balances may be recognized in the consolidated statements of operations in “Net revenue.” Inventory. Inventory is valued at the lower of cost and market. Cost is determined using weighted-average costs. For finished goods, market is defined as net realizable value, and for raw materials, market is defined as replacement cost. Cost of inventories includes acquisition and production costs including raw material and labor, as applicable, and all costs incurred to deliver inventory to our distribution centers including freight, non-refundable taxes, duty and other landing costs. We periodically review our inventories and make provisions as necessary to appropriately value obsolete or damaged goods. The amount of the provision is equal to the difference between the book cost of the inventory and its estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demands, selling prices and market conditions. In addition, as part of inventory valuations, we provide for inventory shrinkage based on historical trends from actual physical inventories. Inventory shrinkage estimates are made to reduce the inventory value for lost or stolen items. We perform physical inventory counts throughout the year and adjust the shrink provision accordingly. In fiscal 2011, we wrote-off $3.1 million of inventory and in fiscal 2010 we wrote-off $1.0 million of inventory. Property and Equipment. Property and equipment are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation. Direct internal and external costs related to software used for internal purposes which are incurred during the application development stage or for upgrades that add functionality are capitalized. All other costs related to internal use 42 Table of Contents software are expensed as incurred. Buildings are amortized on a straight-line basis over the expected useful life of the asset. Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the lesser of the length of the lease, without consideration of option renewal periods and the estimated useful life of the assets, up to a maximum of five years. All other property and equipment are amortized using the declining balance method as follows: Furniture and fixtures 20 % Computer hardware and software 30 % Equipment and vehicles 30 % We recognize a liability for the fair value of a required asset retirement obligation, or ARO, when such obligation is incurred. Our AROs are primarily associated with leasehold improvements which, at the end of a lease, we are contractually obligated to remove in order to comply with the lease agreement. At the inception of a lease with such conditions, we record an ARO liability and a corresponding capital asset in an amount equal to the estimated fair value of the obligation. The liability is estimated based on a number of assumptions requiring management’s judgment, including store closing costs, cost inflation rates and discount rates, and is accreted to its projected future value over time. The capitalized asset is depreciated using the convention for depreciation of leasehold improvement assets. Upon satisfaction of the ARO conditions, any difference between the recorded ARO liability and the actual retirement costs incurred is recognized as an operating gain or loss in the consolidated statements of operations. We recognize a liability for a cost associated with a lease exit activity when such obligation is incurred. A lease exit activity is measured initially at its fair value in the period in which the liability is incurred. We estimate fair value at the cease-use date of its operating leases as the remaining lease rentals, reduced by estimated sublease rentals that could be reasonably obtained for the property, even where we does not intend to enter into a sublease. Estimating the cost of certain lease exit costs involves subjective assumptions, including the time it would take to sublease the leased location and the related potential sublease income. The estimated accruals for these costs could be significantly affected if future experience differs from that used in the initial estimate. Lease exit costs are included in provision for impairment and lease exit costs. Long-Lived Assets. Long-lived assets, including intangible assets with finite useful lives, held for use are evaluated for impairment when the occurrence of events or changes in circumstances indicates that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable as measured by comparing their net book value to the estimated future cash flows generated by their use and eventual disposition. Impaired assets are recorded at fair value, determined principally by the estimated future cash flows expected from their use and eventual disposition. Reductions in asset values resulting from impairment valuations are recognized in income in the period that the impairment is determined. Long-lived assets, including intangible assets with finite useful lives, held for sale are reported at the lower of the carrying value of the asset and fair value less cost to sell. Any write-downs to reflect fair value less selling cost is recognized in income when the asset is classified as held for sale. Gains or losses on assets held for sale and asset dispositions are included in provision for impairment and lease exit costs. Income Taxes. We follow the liability method with respect to accounting for income taxes. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates that are expected to be in effect when these differences are anticipated to reverse. Deferred income tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance, if based on the weight of available positive and negative evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The recognition of a deferred income tax asset is based upon several assumptions and management forecasts, including current and proposed tax legislation, current and anticipated taxable income, utilization of previously unrealized non-operating loss carry forwards and regulatory reviews of tax filings. Given the judgments and estimates required and the sensitivity of the results to the significant assumptions used, we believe the accounting estimates used in relation to the recognition of deferred income tax assets are subject to measurement uncertainty and are susceptible to a material change if the underlying assumptions change. 43 Table of Contents For financial reporting purposes, we generally provide taxes at the rate applicable for the appropriate tax jurisdiction. Because our present intention is to reinvest the unremitted earnings in our foreign operations, we do not provide U.S. income taxes on unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries. Management periodically assesses the need to utilize these unremitted earnings to finance our foreign operations. This assessment is based on cash flow projections that are the result of estimates of future production, fiscal requirements by tax jurisdiction of our operations and operational and fiscal objectives by tax jurisdiction for our operations. Such estimates are inherently imprecise since many assumptions utilized in the cash flow projections are subject to revision in the future. We file income tax returns in the United States, Canada and various foreign and state jurisdictions. We are subject to income tax examination by tax authorities in all jurisdictions from our inception to date. Our policy is to recognize interest expense and penalties related to income tax matters as a selling, general and administrative expense. At January 29, 2012, we do not have any significant accruals for interest related to unrecognized tax benefits or tax penalties. Our intercompany transfer pricing policies are currently subject to audits by various foreign tax jurisdictions. Although we believe that our intercompany transfer pricing policies and tax positions are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits or potential tax disputes may be materially different from that which is reflected in our income tax provisions and accruals. Goodwill and Intangible Assets. Intangible assets are recorded at cost. Non-competition agreements are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life of five years. Reacquired franchise rights are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives of 10 years. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair market value of identifiable net assets acquired and is not amortized. Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested for impairment annually or more frequently when an event or circumstance indicates that goodwill or indefinite useful live intangible assets might be impaired. We use our best estimates and judgment based on available evidence in conducting the impairment testing. When the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess of the carrying value over its fair market value. Stock-Based Compensation. We account for stock-based compensation using the fair value method. The fair value of awards granted is estimated at the date of grant and recognized as employee compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period with the offsetting credit to additional paid-in capital. Our calculation of stock-based compensation requires us to make a number of complex and subjective estimates and assumptions, including future forfeitures, stock price volatility, expected life of the options and related tax effects. The estimation of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment, and to the extent actual results differ from our estimates, such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised. We consider several factors when estimating expected forfeitures, such as types of awards, size of option holder group and anticipated employee retention. Actual results may differ substantially from these estimates. Expected volatility of the stock is based on our review of companies we believe of similar growth and maturity and our peer group in the industry in which we do business because we do not have sufficient historical volatility data for our own stock. The expected term of options granted is derived from the output of the option valuation model and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding. In the future, as we gain historical data for volatility in our own stock and the actual term employees hold our options, expected volatility and expected term may change which could substantially change the grant-date fair value of future awards of stock options and, ultimately, the expense we record. For awards with service and/or performance conditions, the total amount of compensation expense to be recognized is based on the number of awards that are expected to vest and is adjusted to reflect those awards that do ultimately vest. For awards with performance conditions, we recognize the compensation expense over the requisite service period as determined by a range of probability weighted outcomes. For awards with market and or performance conditions, all compensation expense is recognized if it is probable that the underlying market or performance conditions will be fulfilled. Certain employees are entitled to share-based awards from one of our principal stockholders. These awards are accounted for as employee compensation expense in accordance with the above noted policies. 44 Table of Contents Recent Accounting Pronouncements In April 2010, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) amended Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 718 Compensation (“ASC 718”) to clarify that a share-based payment award with an exercise price denominated in the currency of a market in which a substantial portion of the entity’s equity securities trades should not be considered to contain a market, performance or service condition. Therefore, an entity should not classify such an award as a liability if it otherwise qualifies for classification in equity. This guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2010 and is to be applied prospectively. The Company adopted the amendment in the first quarter of fiscal 2011 with no material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. In May 2011, the FASB amended ASC Topic 820 Fair Value Measurement (“ASC 820”) to clarify requirements for how to measure fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurements common to US GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards. This guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2011. The Company will adopt the amendment in the first quarter of fiscal 2012 and expects no material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. In June 2011, the FASB amended ASC Topic 220 Comprehensive Income (“ASC 220”) to require (i) that all non-owner changes in stockholders’ equity be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements, and (ii) presentation of reclassification adjustments from other comprehensive income (“OCI”) to net income on the face of the financial statements. This guidance eliminates the option to present the components of OCI as part of the statement of changes in stockholders’ equity, but does not change the items that must be reported in OCI or when an item of OCI must be reclassified to net income. This guidance is effective for years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2011. The Company will adopt the amendment in fiscal 2012 and expects no material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. In September 2011, the FASB amended ASC Topic 350 Intangibles—Goodwill and Other (“ASC 350”) to allow a company to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test. Under this amendment, a company would not be required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the company determines, based on a qualitative assessment, that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount. The amendment includes a number of events and circumstances for a company to consider in conducting the qualitative assessment. This guidance is effective for annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2011. The Company will adopt the amendment in the first quarter of fiscal 2012 and expects no material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates. Our market risk exposure is primarily a result of fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. We do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. Foreign Currency Exchange Risk. We currently generate a significant portion of our net revenue in Canada. The reporting currency for our consolidated financial statements is the U.S. dollar. Historically, our operations were based largely in Canada. As of January 29, 2012, we operated 47 stores in Canada. As a result, we have been impacted by changes in exchange rates and may be impacted materially for the foreseeable future. As we recognize net revenue from sales in Canada in Canadian dollars, and the U.S. dollar has strengthened during fiscal 2011, it has had a negative impact on our Canadian operating results upon translation of those results into U.S. dollars for the purposes of consolidation. However, the loss in net revenue was partially offset by lower cost of sales and lower selling, general and administrative expenses that are generated in Canadian dollars. A 10% depreciation in the relative value of the Canadian dollar compared to the U.S. dollar would have resulted in lost income from operations of approximately $15.4 million in fiscal 2011 and approximately $11.3 million in fiscal 2010. To the extent the ratio between our net revenue generated in Canadian dollars increases as compared to our 45 Table of Contents expenses generated in Canadian dollars, we expect that our results of operations will be further impacted by changes in exchange rates. A portion of our net revenue is generated in Australia. A 10% depreciation in the relative value of the Australian dollar compared to the U.S. dollar would have resulted in lost income from operations of approximately $0.4 million in fiscal 2011 and $0.1 million in fiscal 2010. We do not currently hedge foreign currency fluctuations. However, in the future, in an effort to mitigate losses associated with these risks, we may at times enter into derivative financial instruments, although we have not historically done so. We do not, and do not intend to, engage in the practice of trading derivative securities for profit. Interest Rate Risk. In April 2007, we entered into an uncommitted senior secured demand revolving credit facility with Royal Bank of Canada. The revolving credit facility provides us with available borrowings in an amount up to CDN$20.0 million. Because our revolving credit facility bears interest at a variable rate, we will be exposed to market risks relating to changes in interest rates, if we have a meaningful outstanding balance. As of January 29, 2012, we had no outstanding borrowings under our revolving facility. We had small outstanding balances under our revolving facility during fiscal 2011 as we built inventory and working capital for the holiday selling season, but we do not believe we are significantly exposed to changes in interest rate risk. We currently do not engage in any interest rate hedging activity and currently have no intention to do so in the foreseeable future. However, in the future, if we have a meaningful outstanding balance under our revolving facility, in an effort to mitigate losses associated with these risks, we may at times enter into derivative financial instruments, although we have not historically done so. These may take the form of forward sales contracts, option contracts, and interest rate swaps. We do not, and do not intend to, engage in the practice of trading derivative securities for profit. Inflation Inflationary factors such as increases in the cost of our product and overhead costs may adversely affect our operating results. Although we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations to date, a high rate of inflation in the future may have an adverse effect on our ability to maintain current levels of gross margin and selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenue if the selling prices of our products do not increase with these increased costs. 46 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 21:53:22.969689
1397187,LULU,lululemon athletica inc.,2013,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS This discussion summarizes our consolidated operating results, financial condition and liquidity during the three-year period ending February 3, 2013. Our fiscal year ends on the Sunday closest to January 31 of the following year, typically resulting in a 52 week year, but occasionally giving rise to an additional week, resulting in a 53 week year. Fiscal 2012 is a 53 week year. Net sales numbers include results from the 53rd week; however, comparable stores sales calculations exclude the 53rd week. Fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010 ended on February 3, 2013, January 29, 2012 and January 30, 2011, respectively. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements based on current expectations that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions, such as our plans, objectives, expectations and intentions set forth in the “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.” Our actual results and the timing of events may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth in the “Item 1A—Risk Factors” section and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Overview Our results for fiscal 2012 demonstrate the ongoing success of our efforts to execute the goals we set at the end of last year. We committed to continued investment in our stores and our people, making infrastructure enhancements and funding working capital requirements, while remaining conscious of our discretionary spending. These goals included driving store productivity along with North American store build out and ecommerce, seeding international markets via a community, showroom and ecommerce model, and reinvesting in product innovation to create value and differentiation in our product lines and to enhance our leadership position for the long term. We continually assess the economic environment and market conditions when making decisions regarding timing of our investments. Our investments in our stores and people were reflected in our comparable stores net revenue growth, which leveraged our fixed operating costs. We increased our store base through execution of our real estate strategy, when and where we saw opportunities for success. For example, we opened 37 new corporate-owned stores in North America, Australia, and New Zealand since fiscal 2011. Where we find opportunities for growth through opening showrooms, or other community presence efforts, we expect to expand our store base and therefore our business. Our growth strategy relies on positive comparable store sales and expansion in North America, particularly in the United States. We have also determined that international growth is an opportunity and are expanding our foothold in markets by establishing local community connections, distributing to strategic sales partners and opening showrooms where we feel our key guests are shopping. Throughout fiscal 2012, we were able to grow our e-commerce business which has further increased our brand awareness and has made our product available in new markets, including those outside of North America. This sales channel offers a higher operating margin than our other segments and accounted for 16.1% of total revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 compared to 13.5% of total revenue in the same period of the prior year. Continuing increases in traffic and conversion rates on our e-commerce website lead us to believe that there is potential for our direct to consumer segment to become an increasingly substantial part of our business and we plan to continue to commit a portion of our resources to further developing this channel. In fiscal 2012 we launched country and region specific websites in Australia, Europe and Asia to provide our online guests with local content, assortment and pricing. In mid-March 2013, we determined that certain shipments of women’s black Luon bottoms received from our factories and available in our stores from March 1, 2013, did not meet our technical specifications. As we became aware of this issue, we pulled what we believe to be all of the affected items from our stores, showrooms 22 Table of Contents and e-commerce sites and began working with our supplier to replace the fabric and with our other manufacturers to replace these items as quickly as possible. The lost revenue, additional costs expected to be incurred and the write down of affected product on hand from this issue will negatively impact our results from operations in Fiscal 2013. We believe that our brand is recognized as premium in our offerings of run and yoga assortment, as well as a leader in technical fabrics and functionality. This has made our product desirable to our consumers and has driven demand, which we are able to meet given our increased product depth compared to last year. Delivering quality to our customers is a critical factor in our market place differentiation and removing items that do not meet our standards is key to maintaining our brand reputation. In fiscal 2013, we plan on investing in new and legacy information technology systems to develop new capabilities in our vertical retail strategy. We have recently added strong leadership in Quality Control, our Liason Office and our commercialization and development teams, and expect these people and other investments to solidify our quality consistency and our delivery capabilities. We believe our strong cash flow generation, solid balance sheet and healthy liquidity provide us with the financial flexibility to continue executing the initiatives which we believe will lead to quality growth. Operating Segment Overview lululemon is a designer and retailer of technical athletic apparel operating primarily in North America and Australia. Our yoga-inspired apparel is marketed under the lululemon athletica and ivivva athletica brand names. We offer a comprehensive line of apparel and accessories including fitness pants, shorts, tops and jackets designed for athletic pursuits such as yoga, running and general fitness, and dance-inspired apparel for female youth. As of February 3, 2013, our branded apparel was principally sold through 211 corporate-owned stores that are located in the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand and via our e-commerce websites through our direct to consumer sales channel. We believe our vertical retail strategy allows us to interact more directly with and gain insights from our customers while providing us with greater control of our brand. In fiscal 2012, 61% of our net revenue was derived from sales of our products in the United States, 34% of our net revenue was derived from the sales of our products in Canada and 5% of our net revenue was derived from sales of our products outside of North America. In fiscal 2011, 53% of our net revenue was derived from sales of our products in the United States, 43% of our net revenue was derived from the sales of our products in Canada and 4% of our net revenue was derived from sales of our products outside of North America. In fiscal 2010, 46% of our net revenue was derived from sales of our products in the United States, 52% of our net revenue was derived from the sales of our products in Canada and 2% of our net revenue was derived from sales of our products outside of North America. Our net revenue increased from $1,000.8 million in fiscal 2011 to $1,370.4 million in fiscal 2012, representing a 37% increase. Our increase in net revenue from fiscal 2011 to fiscal 2012 resulted from the addition of 37 retail locations, and comparable store sales growth of 16% in fiscal 2012, excluding the impact of the 53rd week. Our ability to open new stores and grow sales in existing stores has been driven by increasing demand for our technical athletic apparel and a growing recognition of the lululemon athletica brand. We believe our superior products, strategic store locations, inviting store environment, grassroots marketing approach and distinctive corporate culture are responsible for our strong financial performance. We have three reportable segments: corporate-owned stores, direct to consumer and other. We report our segments based on the financial information we use in managing our businesses. While we receive financial information for each corporate-owned store, we have aggregated all of the corporate-owned stores into one reportable segment due to the similarities in the economic and other characteristics of these stores. Our corporate-owned stores segment accounted for 80% of our net revenue in fiscal 2012, 82% in fiscal 2011 and 83% in fiscal 2010. Our direct to consumer segment accounted for 14% of our net revenue in fiscal 2012, 11% in fiscal 2011 and 8% in fiscal 2010. Our other segment, consisting of franchise sales, wholesale accounts, sales from company-operated showrooms, warehouse sales and outlets, each accounted for less than 10% of our net revenue in each of fiscal 2012, fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010. We previously reported our franchise channel as an operating segment; however, we reacquired our remaining four franchised stores in fiscal 2011 and opening new franchise stores is not part of our growth strategy. 23 Table of Contents As of February 3, 2013, we sold our products through 211 corporate-owned stores located in, the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. We plan to increase our net revenue in North America and Australia by opening additional corporate-owned stores in new and existing markets. Corporate-owned stores accounted for 80% of total net revenue in fiscal 2012, 82% of total net revenue in fiscal 2011 and 83% of total net revenue in fiscal 2010. As of February 3, 2013, our direct to consumer segment included our lululemon and ivivva e-commerce websites. E-commerce sales are taken directly from retail customers through www.lululemon.com and www.ivivva.com and other country and region specific websites. Our direct to consumer segment is an increasingly substantial part of our growth strategy, and now represents 14% of our net revenue. In addition to deriving revenue from sales through our corporate-owned stores and direct to consumer, we also derive other net revenue, which includes wholesale customers, as well as warehouse sales and sales through a number of company-operated showrooms and temporary locations. Wholesale customers include select premium yoga studios, health clubs and fitness centers. Warehouse sales are typically held one or more times a year to sell slow moving inventory or inventory from prior seasons to retail customers at discounted prices. Our showrooms are typically small locations that we open from time to time when we enter new markets and feature a limited selection of our product offering during select hours. Our temporary locations are typically opened for the holiday season in markets in which we may not already have a presence. We reacquired our four remaining franchise stores during fiscal 2011, and as such, franchise sales, which included inventory sales and royalties, are no longer a part of our other net revenue. Other net revenue accounted for 6% of total revenue in fiscal 2012, 7% of total net revenue in fiscal 2011 and 9% of total net revenue in fiscal 2010. We believe that our athletic apparel has and will continue to appeal to consumers outside of North America who value its technical attributes as well as its function and style. In 2004, we opened our first store in Australia which was operated under a franchise license. In fiscal 2009 we made a 13% equity investment in lululemon athletica australia Pty, our franchise operator. During fiscal 2010 we increased our investment to 80% which provided us with control over lululemon athletica australia Pty. During fiscal 2012 we purchased the remaining non-controlling interest in lululemon athletica australia Pty. In fiscal 2008, we opened our first company-operated showroom in Hong Kong and in fiscal 2012 we opened our first company-operated showroom in the United Kingdom. Basis of Presentation Net revenue is comprised of: • corporate-owned store net revenue, which includes sales to customers through corporate-owned stores in North America and Australia; • direct to consumer revenue, which includes sales from our e-commerce websites; and • other net revenue, which includes wholesale accounts, franchises net revenue, which consists of royalties as well as sales of our products to franchises, warehouse sales, outlets and sales from company-operated showrooms. in each case, net of an estimated allowance for sales returns and discounts. In addition, we separately track comparable store sales, which reflect net revenue at corporate-owned stores that have been open for at least 12 months. Therefore, net revenue from a store is included in comparable store sales beginning with the first month for which the store has a full month of comparable prior year sales. Non-comparable store sales include sales from new stores that have not been open or otherwise not operated by us for 12 months or from stores which have been significantly remodeled or relocated. Also included in non-comparable stores sales are sales from direct to consumer sales, wholesale, franchises, warehouse sales and 24 Table of Contents showrooms, and sales from corporate-owned stores which we have closed. The 53rd week of fiscal 2012 is excluded from the calculation of comparable store sales. By measuring the change in year-over-year net revenue in stores that have been open for 12 months or more, comparable store sales allows us to evaluate how our core store base is performing. Various factors affect comparable store sales, including: • the location of new stores relative to existing stores; • consumer preferences, buying trends and overall economic trends; • our ability to anticipate and respond effectively to customer preferences for technical athletic apparel; • competition; • changes in our merchandise mix; • pricing; • the timing of our releases of new merchandise and promotional events; • the effectiveness of our grassroots marketing efforts; • the level of customer service that we provide in our stores; • our ability to source and distribute products efficiently; and • the number of stores we open, close (including for temporary renovations) and expand in any period. Opening new stores is an important part of our growth strategy. Accordingly, comparable store sales has limited utility for assessing the success of our growth strategy insofar as comparable store sales do not reflect the performance of stores open less than 12 months. Cost of goods sold includes: • the cost of purchased merchandise, which includes acquisition and production costs including raw material and labor, as applicable; • the cost incurred to deliver inventory to our distribution centers including freight, non-refundable taxes, duty and other landing costs; • the cost of our distribution centers (such as labor, rent and utilities) and the depreciation and amortization related to our distribution centers; • the cost of our production, merchandise and design departments including salaries, stock-based compensation and benefits, and operating expenses; • the cost of occupancy related to store operations (such as rent and utilities) and the depreciation and amortization related to store-level capital expenditures; • hemming; and • shrink and valuation reserves. Cost of goods sold also may change as we open or close stores because of the resulting change in related occupancy costs. The primary drivers of the costs of individual goods are the costs of raw materials and labor in the countries where we source our merchandise. Selling, general and administrative expenses consist of all operating costs not otherwise included in cost of goods sold. Our selling, general and administrative expenses include marketing costs, accounting costs, information technology costs, human resource costs, professional fees, corporate facility costs, corporate and 25 Table of Contents store-level payroll and benefits expenses, stock-based compensation and occupancy, depreciation and amortization expense for all assets other than depreciation and amortization expenses related to store-level capital expenditures and our distribution centers, each of which are included in cost of goods sold. We anticipate that our selling, general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars due to anticipated continued growth of our corporate support staff and store-level employees. Other income (expense), net includes interest earned on our cash balances and our advances to franchise, interest costs associated with our credit facilities and with letters of credit drawn under these facilities for the purchase of merchandise and our share of the operations of our investment in lululemon athletica australia PTY prior to obtaining control in fiscal 2010, including the remeasurement of our investment immediately before obtaining control of the business. We expect to continue to generate interest income to the extent that our cash generated from operations exceeds our cash used for investment. We have maintained relatively small outstanding balances on our credit facilities and expect to continue to do so for the foreseeable future. Provision for income taxes depends on the statutory tax rates in the countries where we sell our products. Historically we had generated taxable income in Canada and we had generated tax losses in the United States. In fiscal 2010 we earned taxable income in the United States and fully utilized any net operating losses available from prior periods. We anticipate continued growth in the United States and consequently foresee an increase in taxable income reported. We have recorded deferred tax assets in respect of deductible temporary differences of $15.0 million. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2012 was 7.3% lower than the effective rate for fiscal 2011 due primarily to the ongoing impact of revised intercompany pricing agreements. Our effective tax rate in fiscal 2012 was 28.8%, compared to 36.1% in fiscal 2011 and 33.3% in fiscal 2010. We anticipate that in the future we may start to sell our products directly to some customers located outside of Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom, Hong Kong, Australia and New Zealand, in which case we would become subject to taxation based on the foreign statutory rates in the countries where these sales take place and our effective tax rate could fluctuate accordingly. Results of Operations The following tables summarize key components of our results of operations for the periods indicated, both in dollars and as a percentage of net revenue: Fiscal Year Ended February 3,2013 January 29,2012 January 30,2011 (In thousands) Consolidated statements of operations: Net revenue $ 1,370,358 $ 1,000,839 $ 711,704 Cost of goods sold 607,532 431,488 316,757 Gross profit 762,826 569,351 394,947 Selling, general and administrative expenses 386,387 282,393 214,556 Income from operations 376,439 286,958 180,391 Other income (expense), net 4,957 2,500 2,886 Income before provision for income taxes 381,396 289,458 183,277 Provision for income taxes 109,965 104,494 61,080 Net income 271,431 184,964 122,197 Net income attributable to non-controlling interest 875 901 350 Net income attributable to lululemon athletica inc. $ 270,556 $ 184,063 $ 121,847 26 Table of Contents Fiscal Year Ended February 3,2013 January 29,2012 January 30,2011 (% of net revenue) Net revenue 100.0 100.0 100.0 Cost of goods sold 44.3 43.1 44.5 Gross profit 55.7 56.9 55.5 Selling, general and administrative expenses 28.2 28.2 30.1 Income from operations 27.5 28.7 25.4 Other income (expense), net 0.3 0.2 0.4 Income before provision for income taxes 27.8 28.9 25.8 Provision for income taxes 8.0 10.4 8.6 Net income 19.8 18.5 17.2 Net income attributable to non-controlling interest 0.1 0.1 0.1 Net income attributable to lululemon athletica inc. 19.7 18.4 17.1 Comparison of Fiscal 2012 to Fiscal 2011 Net Revenue Net revenue increased $369.5 million, or 37%, to $1,370.4 million in fiscal 2012 from $1,000.8 million in fiscal 2011. Assuming the average exchange rates in fiscal 2012 remained constant with the average exchange rates in fiscal 2011, our net revenue would have increased $370.5 million, or 37%. The net revenue increase was driven by increased sales at locations in our comparable stores base, sales from new stores opened, and the growth of our direct to consumer segment. The constant dollar increase in comparable store sales was driven primarily by the strength of our existing product lines, successful introduction of new products and increasing recognition of the lululemon athletica brand name, especially at our U.S. stores, that drove higher transactions per store. Our net revenue on a segment basis for fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011 are expressed in dollar amounts as well as relevant percentages, presented as a percentage of total net revenue below. Fiscal Year Ended February 3, 2013 andJanuary 29, 2012 2012 2011 2012 2011 (In thousands) (Percentages) Corporate-owned stores $ 1,090,181 $ 816,925 79.6 81.6 Direct to consumer 197,255 106,313 14.4 10.6 Other 82,922 77,601 6.0 7.8 Net revenue $ 1,370,358 $ 1,000,839 100.0 100.0 Corporate-Owned Stores. Net revenue from our corporate-owned stores segment increased $273.3 million, or 33%, to $1,090.2 million in fiscal 2012 from $816.9 million in fiscal 2011. The following contributed to the increase in net revenue from our corporate-owned stores segment: • Comparable store sales increase of 16% in fiscal 2012 resulted in a $118.3 million increase to net revenue, including the effect of foreign currency fluctuations. Excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations, comparable store sales increased 16%, or $119.3 million, in fiscal 2012; 27 Table of Contents • Net revenue from corporate-owned stores we opened during fiscal 2012, and during fiscal 2011 prior to sales from such stores becoming part of our comparable stores base, contributed $136.3 million of the increase. New store openings in fiscal 2012 included four stores in Canada, including three ivivva branded stores, 27 stores in the United States, five in Australia, and one in New Zealand; and • Net revenue of $18.7 from the 53rd week of fiscal 2012, which was excluded in the calculation of comparable store sales. Direct to Consumer. Net revenue from our direct to consumer segment increased $90.9 million, or 86%, to $197.3 million in fiscal 2012 from $106.3 million in fiscal 2011, including $4.2 million of net revenue from the 53rd week of fiscal 2012. The increase in net revenue from our direct to consumer segment was a result of increasing traffic, conversion rates and average order value on our e-commerce website, as well as making our products available in new markets outside of North America. Other. Net revenue from our other segment increased $5.3 million, or 7%, to $82.9 million in fiscal 2012 from $77.6 million in fiscal 2011. The increase in net revenue from our other segment was primarily due to increased sales from our outlets and showrooms sales channels. The increase was partially offset by decreased net revenue from wholesale. In addition, we reacquired our four remaining franchise stores during fiscal 2011, therefore revenue from these stores is now included in our corporate-owned stores segment. We continue to employ our other segment strategy to increase interest in our product in markets where we may not have corporate-owned stores. Gross Profit Gross profit increased $193.5 million, or 34%, to $762.8 million in fiscal 2012 from $569.4 million in fiscal 2011. Increased net revenue in most of our operating segments resulted in an increased gross profit. The increase in gross profit was partially offset by increases in fixed costs, such as occupancy costs and depreciation, as well as increased costs related to our design, merchandising, and production departments. Gross profit, as a percentage of net revenue, or gross margin, decreased 120 basis points, to 55.7% in fiscal 2012 from 56.9% in fiscal 2011. The decrease in gross margin resulted primarily from: • an increase in product costs of 200 basis points due to increased labor and raw materials costs related to increased product innovation, function and garment complexity, as well as an increase in markdowns and discounts due to a more balanced inventory position in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011; • an increase in expenses related to our product and supply chain departments, relative to the increase in net revenue, which had a deleveraging effect on gross margin of 30 basis points. The decrease in gross margin was partially offset by: • a decrease in air freight of 60 basis points due to lower air freight usage than in fiscal 2011; and • a decrease in fixed costs, such as occupancy costs and depreciation, relative to the increase in net revenue, which had a leveraging effect on gross margin of 50 basis points. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $104.0 million, or 37%, to $386.4 million in fiscal 2012 from $282.4 million in fiscal 2011. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was principally comprised of: • an increase in employee costs of $39.2 million as we experience natural growth in labor hours associated with new and existing corporate-owned stores, outlets, showrooms and other, as well as an increase in wages as we invest in our employees; 28 Table of Contents • an increase in variable store costs of $7.0 million as a result of increased sales volume from new and existing corporate-owned stores, outlets, showrooms and other; • an increase in variable costs such as distribution costs, credit card fees and packaging related to our direct to consumer segment of $10.2 million as a result of increased sales volume; • an increase in administrative costs related to our direct to consumer segment of $8.0 million associated with the growth in this channel and increased head count to support it; • an increase in head office employee costs, including stock-based compensation expense and management incentive-based compensation, of $18.9 million from increased head count incurred in order to position us for long-term growth; • an increase in other head office costs of $11.2 million as a result of the overall growth of our business and investment in strategic initiatives and projects; and • an increase in other costs, including occupancy costs and depreciation not included in cost of goods sold, of $9.5 million as a result of the expansion of our business and in order to position us for long-term growth. As a percentage of net revenue, selling, general and administrative expenses remained unchanged at 28.2% in both fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011. We expect selling, general and administrative expenses to increase throughout fiscal 2013 as we add administrative and sales personnel and increase our infrastructure to support the growth in our store base. Income from Operations Income from operations increased $89.5 million, or 31%, to $376.4 million in fiscal 2012 from $287.0 million in fiscal 2011. The increase was a result of increased gross profit of $193.5 million, partially offset by increased selling, general and administrative costs of $104.0 million. The increase in selling, general and administrative costs was primarily driven by the increase in our business, as seen in our net revenue increases. On a segment basis, we determine income from operations without taking into account our general corporate expenses. We have reviewed our general corporate expenses and determined some costs previously classified as general corporate are direct segment expenses. Accordingly, all prior year comparable information has been reclassified to conform to the current year classification. Income from operations before general corporate expenses for fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011 are expressed in dollar amounts as well as percentages, presented as a percentage of net revenue of their respective operating segments below. Fiscal Year Ended February 3, 2013 andJanuary 29, 2012 2012 2011 2012 2011 (In thousands) (Percentages) Corporate-owned stores $ 379,670 $ 297,809 34.8 36.5 Direct to consumer 82,947 44,175 42.1 41.6 Other 17,370 21,103 20.9 27.2 Income from operations before general corporate expense $ 479,987 $ 363,087 General corporate expense $ 103,548 $ 76,129 Income from operations $ 376,439 $ 286,958 29 Table of Contents Corporate-Owned Stores. Income from operations from our corporate-owned stores segment increased $81.9 million, or 27%, to $379.7 million for fiscal 2012 from $297.8 million for fiscal 2011 primarily due to an increase of $137.1 million in gross profit, which was offset partially by a natural increase in selling, general and administrative expenses related to employee costs as well as operating expenses associated with new stores and net revenue growth at existing stores. Income from operations as a percentage of corporate-owned stores revenue decreased by 170 basis points primarily from a decrease in gross margin related to increased product costs. Direct to consumer. Income from operations from our direct to consumer segment increased $38.8 million, or 88%, to $82.9 million in fiscal 2012 from $44.2 million in fiscal 2011 due to increased sales through our e-commerce website and the addition of regional websites, with gross profit increasing $56.2 over fiscal 2011. Income from operations as a percentage of direct to consumer revenue increased by 50 basis points in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 due to leverage on fixed costs. Other. Income from operations from our other segment decreased $3.7 million, or 18%, to $17.4 million in fiscal 2012 from $21.1 million in fiscal 2011. The decrease was primarily the result of our reacquisition of our four remaining franchise stores during fiscal 2011, as revenue from these stores is now included in our corporate-owned stores segment. We continue to employ our other segment strategy to increase interest in our product in markets we have not otherwise entered with corporate-owned stores. General Corporate Expense. General corporate expenses increased $27.4 million, or 36%, to $103.5 million in fiscal 2012 from $76.1 million in fiscal 2011. This increase was primarily due to an increase in expenses related to our head office growth of $19.4 million, which was largely related to the growth of our information technology department for systems implementations and infrastructure investments, our human resources department as a result of the overall growth of our business, and increased professional fees related to investment in strategic initiatives and projects. General corporate expenses also increased as a result of increased stock-based compensation expense of $4.7 million and increased depreciation and amortization expense of $3.3 million. General corporate expenses are expected to continue to increase in future years as we grow our overall business and require increased efforts at our head office to support our corporate-owned stores, direct to consumer and other segments. Other Income (Expense), Net Other income (expense), net increased $2.5 million, to $5.0 million in fiscal 2012 from $2.5 million in fiscal 2011. The increase was primarily a result of increased interest income earned in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 on our increased cash balances. Provision for Income Taxes Provision for income taxes increased $5.5 million, or 5%, to $110.0 million in fiscal 2012 from $104.5 million in fiscal 2011. In fiscal 2012, our effective tax rate was 28.8% compared to 36.1% in fiscal 2011. The lower effective tax rate was due to the ongoing impact of revised intercompany pricing agreements. We have not recorded deferred taxes on undistributed earnings and other temporary differences of our Canadian subsidiary which are considered to be indefinitely reinvested. If management’s intentions with respect to these undistributed earnings and other temporary differences were to change in the future, deferred taxes may need to be provided that could materially impact our financial results. Net Income Net income increased $86.5 million, or 47%, to $270.6 million in fiscal 2012 from $184.1 million in fiscal 2011. The increase in net income in fiscal 2012 was primarily due to a $193.5 million increase in gross profit resulting from sales growth at existing and additional corporate-owned stores opened during fiscal 2012 and 30 Table of Contents increasing traffic on our e-commerce website and the addition of regional websites and a $2.5 million increase in other income (expense), net, offset by an increase of $104.0 million in selling, general and administrative expenses, and an increase of $5.5 million in provision for income taxes. Comparison of Fiscal 2011 to Fiscal 2010 Net Revenue Net revenue increased $289.1 million, or 41%, to $1,000.8 million in fiscal 2011 from $711.7 million in fiscal 2010. Assuming the average exchange rate between the Canadian and United States dollars and the Australian and United States dollars in fiscal 2010 remained constant, our net revenue would have increased $274.7 million, or 39%, in fiscal 2011. The net revenue increase was driven by increased sales at locations in our comparable stores base, sales from new stores opened, sales from franchised stores that were reacquired during fiscal 2011 and the growth of our direct to consumer segment. The constant dollar increase in comparable store sales was driven primarily by the strength of our existing product lines, successful introduction of new products and increasing recognition of the lululemon athletica brand name, especially at our U.S. stores. Our net revenue on a segment basis for fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010 are expressed in dollar amounts as well as relevant percentages, presented as a percentage of total net revenue below. Fiscal Year Ended January 29, 2012 andJanuary 30, 2011 2011 2010 2011 2010 (In thousands) (Percentages) Corporate-owned stores $ 816,925 $ 590,389 81.6 83.0 Direct to consumer 106,313 57,348 10.6 8.1 Other 77,601 63,967 7.8 8.9 Net revenue $ 1,000,839 $ 711,704 100.0 100.0 Corporate-Owned Stores. Net revenue from our corporate-owned stores segment increased $226.5 million, or 38%, to $816.9 million in fiscal 2011 from $590.4 million in fiscal 2010. The following contributed to the increase in net revenue from our corporate-owned stores segment: • Comparable store sales increase of 22% in fiscal 2011 resulted in a $125.2 million increase to net revenue, including the effect of foreign currency fluctuations. Excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations, comparable store sales increased 20%, or $114.2 million, in fiscal 2011; • Net revenue from corporate-owned stores we opened during fiscal 2011, and during fiscal 2010 prior to sales from such stores becoming part of our comparable stores base, contributed $94.8 million of the increase. Net new store openings in fiscal 2011 included three stores in Canada, 26 stores in the United States, seven in Australia, and one in New Zealand; and • The reacquisition of four U.S. franchise stores in fiscal 2011 contributed $6.5 million of the increase. Direct to Consumer. Net revenue from our direct to consumer segment increased $49.0 million, or 85%, to $106.3 million in fiscal 2011 from $57.3 million in fiscal 2010. The increase in net revenue from our direct to consumer segment was a result of increasing traffic, conversion rates, and average order value on our e-commerce website. Other. Net revenue from our other segment increased $13.6 million, or 21%, to $77.6 million in fiscal 2011 from $64.0 million in fiscal 2010. The increase was a result of increasing net revenue across most of our sales channels included in our other segment: wholesale, showrooms, warehouse sales and outlets. Net revenue from our franchise channel decreased due to the reacquisition of our remaining four remaining franchise stores in the United States, now included in our corporate-owned stores segment. 31 Table of Contents Gross Profit Gross profit increased $174.4 million, or 44%, to $569.4 million in fiscal 2011 from $394.9 million in fiscal 2010. Increased net revenue as well as a strengthening Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar improved product margin in all of our operating segments, and ultimately resulted in an increased gross profit. The increase in gross profit was partially offset by increases in fixed costs, such as occupancy costs and depreciation, as well as increased costs related to our design, production, distribution and merchandising departments. Gross profit, as a percentage of net revenue, or gross margin, increased 140 basis points, to 56.9% in fiscal 2011 from 55.5% in fiscal 2010. The increase in gross margin resulted primarily from: • a decrease in fixed costs, such as occupancy costs and depreciation, relative to the increase in net revenue, which had a leveraging effect on gross margin of 80 basis points; • strengthening of the Canadian and Australian dollars, relative to the U.S. dollar, decreased foreign exchange impacts on product costs and contributed 70 basis points; and • a decrease in expenses related to our product and supply chain departments, relative to the increase in net revenue, which had a leveraging effect on gross margin of 10 basis points. The increase in gross margin was partially offset by a decrease in product margins, which contributed 20 basis points. This was primarily a result of product cost pressures from raw materials and labour costs which were partially offset by strong sell through of merchandise with fewer markdowns and discounts than in fiscal 2010. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $67.8 million, or 32%, to $282.4 million in fiscal 2011 from $214.6 million in fiscal 2010. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was principally comprised of: • an increase in employee costs of $29.1 million as we experience natural growth in labor hours associated with new and existing corporate-owned stores, outlets and other, as well as an increase in wages as we invest in our employees; • an increase in head office employee costs, including stock-based compensation expense and management incentive-based compensation, of $15.4 million incurred in order to position us for long-term growth; • an increase in other head office costs of $12.4 million as a result of the expansion of our business; • an increase in other costs, including occupancy costs and depreciation not included in cost of goods sold, of $7.0 million associated with new and existing corporate-owned stores, outlets and other; • an increase in variable store costs of $6.7 million as a result of increased sales volume from new and existing corporate-owned stores, outlets and other; and • an increase in administrative costs of $3.3 million related to our Australian business, in which we increased our investment significantly in the second quarter of fiscal 2010, which we now report on a consolidated basis. 32 Table of Contents The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was partially offset by a decrease in administrative costs of $6.1 million related to our direct to consumer segment. This decrease was primarily associated with a reduction in professional fees resulting from bringing our e-commerce operations in-house in the first half of fiscal 2011, offset by higher costs associated with volume growth in this channel. As a percentage of net revenue, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 190 basis points, to 28.2% in fiscal 2011 from 30.1% in fiscal 2010. Income from Operations Income from operations increased $106.6 million, or 59%, to $287.0 million in fiscal 2011 from $180.4 million in fiscal 2010. The increase was a result of increased gross profit of $174.3 million, partially offset by increased selling, general and administrative costs of $67.8 million. The increase in selling, general and administrative costs was primarily driven by the increase in our business, as seen in our net revenue increases. On a segment basis, we determine income from operations without taking into account our general corporate expenses. We have reviewed our general corporate expenses and determined some costs previously classified as general corporate are direct segment expenses. Accordingly, all prior year comparable information has be reclassified to conform to the current year classification. Income from operations (before general corporate expenses) for fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010 are expressed in dollar amounts as well as percentages, presented as a percentage of net revenue of their respective operating segments below. Fiscal Year Ended January 29, 2012 andJanuary 30, 2011 2011 2010 2011 2010 (In thousands) (Percentages) Corporate-owned stores $ 297,809 $ 207,692 36.5 35.2 Direct to consumer 44,175 14,035 41.6 24.5 Other 21,103 16,925 27.2 26.5 Income from operations before general corporate expense $ 363,087 $ 238,652 General corporate expense $ 76,129 $ 58,261 Income from operations $ 286,958 $ 180,391 Corporate-Owned Stores. Income from operations from our corporate-owned stores segment increased $90.1 million, or 43%, to $297.8 million for fiscal 2011 from $207.7 million for fiscal 2010 primarily due to an increase of $137.2 million in gross profit, which was offset partially by a natural increase in selling, general and administrative expenses related to employee costs as well as operating expenses associated with new stores and net revenue growth at existing stores. Income from operations as a percentage of corporate-owned stores revenue increased by 130 basis points primarily from leverage gained over fixed costs. Direct to consumer. Income from operations from our direct to consumer segment increased $30.1 million, or 215%, to $44.2 million in fiscal 2011 from $14.0 million in fiscal 2010 due to increasing traffic and conversion rates on our e-commerce website. Income from operations as a percentage of direct to consumer revenue increased by 1710 basis points in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 due to decreased professional fees paid as our e-commerce operations were brought in-house near the beginning of fiscal 2011. We discontinued our phone sales channel during fiscal 2011, and therefore our direct to consumer segment will only include e-commerce sales in future fiscal years. Other. Income from operations from our other segment increased $4.2 million, or 25%, to $21.1 million in fiscal 2011 from $16.9 million in fiscal 2010. This increase was primarily the result of temporary locations open 33 Table of Contents in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 and additional warehouse sales held during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010. This increase was also a result of increased income from strategic sales, showrooms and outlets, partially offset by decreased income from our franchise operating channel. We reacquired our four remaining franchised locations during the third quarter of fiscal 2011; as a result, income from operations from the reacquired stores is now included in our corporate-owned stores segment. General Corporate Expense. General corporate expenses increased $17.9 million, or 31%, to $76.1 million in fiscal 2011 from $58.3 million in fiscal 2010. This increase was primarily due to an increase in expenses related to our head office growth of $15.8 million, which was largely related to the growth of our information technology and human resources departments to support the growth of our business. Income from operations also increased as a result of increased stock-based compensation expense of $2.2 million, an increase in foreign exchange losses of $1.2 million, and increased depreciation and amortization expense of $0.5 million. The increase was partially offset by a decreased provision for impairment and lease exit costs of $1.8 million. Other Income (Expense), Net Other income (expense), net decreased $0.4 million, to $2.5 million in fiscal 2011 from $2.9 million in fiscal 2010. The decrease was primarily a result of re-measuring our 13 percent non-controlling equity investment in Australia immediately prior to obtaining control of the business, which led to a $1.8 million gain on investment in fiscal 2010. This was offset by increased interest income earned in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 on our increased cash balances. Provision for Income Taxes Provision for income taxes increased $43.4 million, or 71%, to $104.5 million in fiscal 2011 from $61.1 million in fiscal 2010. In fiscal 2011, our effective tax rate was 36.1% compared to 33.3% in fiscal 2010. The higher effective tax rate was due to the proportional increase of taxable income in the United States in fiscal 2011 compared to taxable income in Canada which is taxed at a rate lower than the US statutory rate combined with the declining Canadian corporate tax rate. We have not recorded deferred taxes on undistributed earnings and other temporary differences of our Canadian subsidiary which are considered to be indefinitely reinvested. If management’s intentions with respect to these undistributed earnings and other temporary differences were to change in the future, deferred taxes may need to be provided that could materially impact our financial results. Net Income Net income increased $62.2 million, or 51%, to $184.1 million in fiscal 2011 from $121.8 million in fiscal 2010. The increase in net income in fiscal 2011 was primarily due to a $174.3 million increase in gross profit resulting from sales growth at existing and additional corporate-owned stores opened during fiscal 2011 and increasing traffic on our e-commerce website, offset by an increase of $67.8 million in selling, general and administrative expenses, an increase of $43.4 million in provision for income taxes, and a $0.4 million decrease in other income (expense), net. Seasonality In fiscal 2012, fiscal 2011, and fiscal 2010, we recognized a significant amount of our net revenue in the fourth quarter due to significant increases in sales during the holiday season. We recognized 35%, 37%, and 36% of our full year gross profit in the fourth quarter in fiscal 2012, fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010, respectively. Despite the fact that we have experienced a significant amount of our net revenue and gross profit in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year, we believe that the true extent of the seasonality or cyclical nature of our business may have been overshadowed by our rapid growth to date. As our expected growth rate slows, we believe that we will experience fourth quarter gross profits as a percentage of full year gross profits as high, or higher, than in the current year. 34 Table of Contents The level of our working capital reflects the seasonality of our business. We expect inventory, accounts payable and accrued expenses to be higher in the third and fourth quarters in preparation for the holiday selling season. Because our products are sold primarily through our stores, order backlog is not material to our business. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our primary sources of liquidity are our current balances of cash and cash equivalents, cash flows from operations and borrowings available under our revolving credit facility. Our primary cash needs are capital expenditures for opening new stores and remodeling existing stores, making information technology system enhancements and funding working capital requirements. Cash and cash equivalents in excess of our needs are held in interest bearing accounts with financial institutions. As of February 3, 2013, our working capital (excluding cash and cash equivalents) was $63.5 million and our cash and cash equivalents were $590.2 million. The following table summarizes our net cash flows provided by and used in operating, investing and financing activities for the periods indicated: Fiscal Year Ended February 3,2013 January 29,2012 January 30,2011 (In thousands) Total cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 280,113 $ 203,615 $ 179,995 Investing activities (93,229 ) (122,311 ) (42,839 ) Financing activities (5,491 ) 15,364 13,699 Effect of exchange rate changes (651 ) (3,517 ) 5,858 Increase in cash and cash equivalents $ 180,742 $ 93,151 $ 156,713 Operating Activities Operating Activities consist primarily of net income adjusted for certain non-cash items, including depreciation and amortization, deferred income taxes, realized gains and losses on disposal of property and equipment, stock-based compensation expense and the effect of the changes in non-cash working capital items, principally accounts receivable, inventories, accounts payable and accrued expenses. In fiscal 2012, cash provided by operating activities increased $76.5 million, to $280.1 million compared to cash provided by operating activities of $203.6 million in fiscal 2011. The increase was primarily a result of increased net income, an increase in items not affecting cash, and an increase in income taxes payable, offset by decreased accounts payable. The net increase in items not affecting cash was primarily due to an increase in depreciation and amortization related to our increased store base, and an increase in stock-based compensation. Depreciation and amortization relate almost entirely to leasehold improvements, furniture and fixtures, computer hardware and software, equipment and vehicles in our stores and other corporate buildings. Depreciation and amortization increased $12.7 million to $43.0 million in fiscal 2012 from $30.3 million in fiscal 2011. Depreciation for our corporate-owned store segment was $27.5 million, $18.5 million, and $15.6 million in fiscal 2012, fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010, respectively. Depreciation for our direct to consumer segment was $3.4 million, $2.4 million and $0.2 million in fiscal 2012, fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010, respectively. Depreciation related to corporate activities was $12.1 million, $9.4 million, and $8.8 million fiscal 2012, fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010, respectively. We have not allocated any depreciation to our other segment as these amounts to date have been immaterial. 35 Table of Contents Investing Activities Investing Activities relate entirely to capital expenditures and acquisitions of franchises. Cash used in investing activities decreased $29.1 million, to $93.2 million in fiscal 2012 from $122.3 million in fiscal 2011. Capital expenditures for our corporate-owned stores segment were $64.9 million in fiscal 2012 which included $29.8 million to open 37 corporate-owned stores and $10.9 million to purchase the land and buildings of two of our corporate-owned stores, and $34.1 million in fiscal 2011 which included $21.9 million to open 41 corporate-owned stores. The remaining capital expenditures for our corporate-owned stores segment in each period were for ongoing store refurbishment. Capital expenditures for our direct to consumer segment were $4.9 million and $6.7 in fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011, respectively. Capital expenditures related to corporate activities and administration were $23.5 million and $76.1 million in fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011, respectively. The decrease in capital expenditures related to corporate activities and administration compared to fiscal 2011 was primarily due to the purchase of our principal executive and administrative offices for $65.1 million plus acquisition-related costs in fiscal 2011. The capital expenditures in each period for corporate activities and administration were for improvements at our head office and other corporate buildings as well as investments in information technology and business systems. Capital expenditures are expected to range between $90 million to $95 million in fiscal 2013, including approximately $30 million for approximately 43 new stores and the remainder reflecting renovation capital for existing stores, information technology enhancements and other corporate activities. Financing Activities Financing Activities consist primarily of cash received on the exercise of stock options, excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation and cash paid to acquire the remaining non-controlling interest in Australia. Cash provided by financing activities decreased $20.9 million, to cash used of $5.5 million in fiscal 2012 from cash provided of $15.4 million in fiscal 2011. The cash used in financing activities for fiscal 2012 included $26.0 million for the purchase of the non-controlling interest in lululemon australia. We believe that our cash from operations and borrowings available to us under our revolving credit facility will be adequate to meet our liquidity needs and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 24 months. Our cash from operations may be negatively impacted by a decrease in demand for our products as well as the other factors described in “Risk Factors.” In addition, we may make discretionary capital improvements with respect to our stores, distribution facilities, headquarters, or other systems, which we would expect to fund through the issuance of debt or equity securities or other external financing sources to the extent we were unable to fund such capital expenditures out of our cash from operations. Revolving Credit Facility In April 2007, we entered into an uncommitted senior secured demand revolving credit facility with Royal Bank of Canada. The revolving credit facility provides us with available borrowings in an amount up to CDN$20.0 million. The revolving credit facility must be repaid in full on demand and is available by way of prime loans in Canadian currency, U.S. base rate loans in U.S. currency, bankers’ acceptances, LIBOR based loans in U.S. currency or Euro currency, letters of credit in Canadian currency or U.S. currency and letters of guaranty in Canadian currency or U.S. currency. The revolving credit facility bears interest on the outstanding balance in accordance with the following: (i) prime rate for prime loans; (ii) U.S. base rate for U.S. based loans; (iii) a fee of 1.125% per annum on bankers’ acceptances; (iv) LIBOR plus 1.125% per annum for LIBOR based loans; (v) a 1.125% annual fee for letters of credit; and (vi) a 1.125% annual fee for letters of guaranty. Both lululemon usa inc. and lululemon FC USA inc., Inc. provided Royal Bank of Canada with guarantees and postponements of claims in the amounts of CDN$20.0 million with respect to lululemon athletica canada inc.’s obligations under the revolving credit facility. The revolving credit facility is also secured by all of our present 36 Table of Contents and after acquired personal property, including all intellectual property and all of the outstanding shares we own in our subsidiaries. As of February 3, 2013, aside from the letters of credit and guarantees, we had $nil in borrowings outstanding under this credit facility. Contractual Obligations and Commitments Leases. We lease certain corporate-owned store locations, storage spaces, building and equipment under non-cancelable operating leases. Our leases generally have initial terms of between five and 10 years, and generally can be extended only in five-year increments, if at all. Our leases expire at various dates between one and 10 years, excluding extensions at our option. A substantial number of our leases for corporate-owned store premises include renewal options and certain of our leases include rent escalation clauses, rent holidays and leasehold rental incentives, none of which are reflected in the following table. Most of our leases for corporate-owned store premises also include contingent rental payments based on sales volume, the impact of which also are not reflected in the following table. The following table summarizes our contractual arrangements as of February 3, 2013, and the timing and effect that such commitments are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods: Payments Due by Fiscal Year Total 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 Thereafter (In thousands) Operating Leases (minimum rent) $ 302,893 $ 57,691 $ 56,920 $ 53,195 $ 47,712 $ 37,192 $ 50,183 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We enter into documentary letters of credit to facilitate the international purchase of merchandise. We also enter into standby letters of credit to secure certain of our obligations, including insurance programs and duties related to import purchases. As of February 3, 2013, letters of credit and letters of guarantee totaling $1.4 million have been issued. Other than these standby letters of credit, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, investments in special purpose entities or undisclosed borrowings or debt. In addition, we have not entered into any derivative contracts or synthetic leases. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions. Predicting future events is inherently an imprecise activity and, as such, requires the use of judgment. Actual results may vary from estimates in amounts that may be material to the financial statements. An accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically, could materially impact our consolidated financial statements. We believe that the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements: Revenue Recognition. Net revenue is comprised of corporate-owned store net revenue, direct to consumer sales through www.lululemon.com, www.ivivva.com and other country and region specific websites, and other net revenue, which includes, franchise royalties as well as sales of products to franchisees, sales to wholesale accounts, warehouse sales and sales from company-operated showrooms, in each case, net of an estimated allowance for sales returns and discounts. Sales to customers through corporate-owned stores and company-operated showrooms are recognized at the point of sale, net of an estimated allowance for sales returns. Direct to consumer sales are recognized when goods are shipped and collection is reasonably assured, net of an estimated 37 Table of Contents allowance for sales returns. Other net revenue related to franchise royalties are recognized when earned, in accordance with the terms of the franchise/license agreements. Royalties are based on a percentage of the franchisees’ sales and recognized when those sales occur. Other net revenue related to warehouse sales is recognized when these sales occur. Amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling are recognized at the time of shipment. Sales are reported on a net revenue basis, which is computed by deducting from our gross sales the amount of sales taxes, actual product returns received, discounts and an amount established for anticipated sales returns. Our estimated allowance for sales returns is a subjective critical estimate that has a direct impact on reported net revenue. This allowance is calculated based on a history of actual returns, estimated future returns and any significant future known or anticipated events. Consideration of these factors results in an estimated allowance for sales returns. Our standard terms for retail sales limit returns to approximately 14 days after the sale of the merchandise. For our wholesale sales, we allow returns from our wholesale customers if properly requested and approved. Employee discounts are classified as a reduction of net revenue. Revenue from our gift cards are recognized when tendered for payment, or upon redemption. Outstanding customer balances are included in “Unredeemed gift card liability” on the consolidated balance sheets. There are no expiration dates on our gift cards, and lululemon does not charge any service fees that cause a decrement to customer balances. While we will continue to honor all gift cards presented for payment, management may determine the likelihood of redemption to be remote for certain card balances due to, among other things, long periods of inactivity. In these circumstances, to the extent management determines there is no requirement for remitting card balances to government agencies under unclaimed property laws, card balances may be recognized in the consolidated statements of operations in “Net revenue.” Inventory. Inventory is valued at the lower of cost and market. Cost is determined using weighted-average costs. For finished goods, market is defined as net realizable value, and for raw materials, market is defined as replacement cost. Cost of inventories includes acquisition and production costs including raw material and labor, as applicable, and all costs incurred to deliver inventory to our distribution centers including freight, non-refundable taxes, duty and other landing costs. We periodically review our inventories and make provisions as necessary to appropriately value obsolete or damaged goods. The amount of the provision is equal to the difference between the book cost of the inventory and its estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demands, selling prices and market conditions. In addition, as part of inventory valuations, we provide for inventory shrinkage based on historical trends from actual physical inventories. Inventory shrinkage estimates are made to reduce the inventory value for lost or stolen items. We perform physical inventory counts throughout the year and adjust the shrink provision accordingly. In fiscal 2012, we wrote-off $6.4 million of inventory and in fiscal 2011 we wrote-off $3.1 million of inventory. Property and Equipment. Property and equipment are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation. Direct internal and external costs related to software used for internal purposes which are incurred during the application development stage or for upgrades that add functionality are capitalized. All other costs related to internal use software are expensed as incurred. Buildings are amortized on a straight-line basis over the expected useful life of the asset, which ranges from 10 to 20 years. Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the lesser of the length of the lease, without consideration of option renewal periods and the estimated useful life of the assets, up to a maximum of five years. All other property and equipment are amortized using the declining balance method as follows: Furniture and fixtures 20 % Computer hardware and software 30 % Equipment and vehicles 30 % 38 Table of Contents We recognize a liability for the fair value of a required asset retirement obligation, or ARO, when such obligation is incurred. Our AROs are primarily associated with leasehold improvements which, at the end of a lease, we are contractually obligated to remove in order to comply with the lease agreement. At the inception of a lease with such conditions, we record an ARO liability and a corresponding capital asset in an amount equal to the estimated fair value of the obligation. The liability is estimated based on a number of assumptions requiring management’s judgment, including store closing costs, cost inflation rates and discount rates, and is accreted to its projected future value over time. The capitalized asset is depreciated using the convention for depreciation of leasehold improvement assets. Upon satisfaction of the ARO conditions, any difference between the recorded ARO liability and the actual retirement costs incurred is recognized as an operating gain or loss in the consolidated statements of operations. We recognize a liability for a cost associated with a lease exit activity when such obligation is incurred. A lease exit activity is measured initially at its fair value in the period in which the liability is incurred. We estimate fair value at the cease-use date of its operating leases as the remaining lease rentals, reduced by estimated sublease rentals that could be reasonably obtained for the property, even where we does not intend to enter into a sublease. Estimating the cost of certain lease exit costs involves subjective assumptions, including the time it would take to sublease the leased location and the related potential sublease income. The estimated accruals for these costs could be significantly affected if future experience differs from that used in the initial estimate. Lease exit costs are included in provision for impairment and lease exit costs. Long-Lived Assets. Long-lived assets, including intangible assets with finite useful lives, held for use are evaluated for impairment when the occurrence of events or changes in circumstances indicates that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable as measured by comparing their net book value to the estimated future cash flows generated by their use and eventual disposition. Impaired assets are recorded at fair value, determined principally by the estimated future cash flows expected from their use and eventual disposition. Reductions in asset values resulting from impairment valuations are recognized in income in the period that the impairment is determined. Long-lived assets, including intangible assets with finite useful lives, held for sale are reported at the lower of the carrying value of the asset and fair value less cost to sell. Any write-downs to reflect fair value less selling cost is recognized in income when the asset is classified as held for sale. Gains or losses on assets held for sale and asset dispositions are included in provision for impairment and lease exit costs. Income Taxes. We follow the liability method with respect to accounting for income taxes. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates that are expected to be in effect when these differences are anticipated to reverse. Deferred income tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance, if based on the weight of available positive and negative evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The recognition of a deferred income tax asset is based upon several assumptions and management forecasts, including current and proposed tax legislation, current and anticipated taxable income, utilization of previously unrealized non-operating loss carry forwards and regulatory reviews of tax filings. Given the judgments and estimates required and the sensitivity of the results to the significant assumptions used, we believe the accounting estimates used in relation to the recognition of deferred income tax assets are subject to measurement uncertainty and are susceptible to a material change if the underlying assumptions change. For financial reporting purposes, we generally provide taxes at the rate applicable for the appropriate tax jurisdiction. Because our present intention is to reinvest the unremitted earnings in our foreign operations, we do not provide U.S. income taxes on unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries. Management periodically assesses the need to utilize these unremitted earnings to finance our foreign operations. This assessment is based on cash flow projections that are the result of estimates of future production, fiscal requirements by tax jurisdiction of our operations and operational and fiscal objectives by tax jurisdiction for our operations. Such estimates are inherently imprecise since many assumptions utilized in the cash flow projections are subject to revision in the future. 39 Table of Contents We file income tax returns in the United States, Canada and various foreign and state jurisdictions. The 2011 and 2012 tax years remain subject to examination by the U.S. federal and state tax authorities. The 2008 tax year is still open for certain state tax authorities. The 2008 to 2012 tax years remain subject to examination by tax authorities in certain foreign jurisdictions. Our policy is to recognize interest expense and penalties related to income tax matters as a selling, general and administrative expense. At February 3, 2013, we do not have any significant accruals for interest related to unrecognized tax benefits or tax penalties. Our intercompany transfer pricing policies are currently subject to audits by various foreign tax jurisdictions. Although we believe that our intercompany transfer pricing policies and tax positions are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits or potential tax disputes may be materially different from that which is reflected in our income tax provisions and accruals. Goodwill and Intangible Assets. Intangible assets are recorded at cost. Non-competition agreements are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life of five years. Reacquired franchise rights are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives of 10 years. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair market value of identifiable net assets acquired and is not amortized. Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested for impairment annually or more frequently when an event or circumstance indicates that goodwill or indefinite useful live intangible assets might be impaired. We use our best estimates and judgment based on available evidence in conducting the impairment testing. When the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess of the carrying value over its fair market value. Stock-Based Compensation. We account for stock-based compensation using the fair value method. The fair value of awards granted is estimated at the date of grant and recognized as employee compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period with the offsetting credit to additional paid-in capital. Our calculation of stock-based compensation requires us to make a number of complex and subjective estimates and assumptions, including future forfeitures, stock price volatility, expected life of the options and related tax effects. The estimation of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment, and to the extent actual results differ from our estimates, such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised. We consider several factors when estimating expected forfeitures, such as types of awards, size of option holder group and anticipated employee retention. Actual results may differ substantially from these estimates. Expected volatility of the stock is based on our review of companies we believe of similar growth and maturity and our peer group in the industry in which we do business because we do not have sufficient historical volatility data for our own stock. The expected term of options granted is derived from the output of the option valuation model and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding. In the future, as we gain historical data for volatility in our own stock and the actual term employees hold our options, expected volatility and expected term may change which could substantially change the grant-date fair value of future awards of stock options and, ultimately, the expense we record. For awards with service and/or performance conditions, the total amount of compensation expense to be recognized is based on the number of awards that are expected to vest and is adjusted to reflect those awards that do ultimately vest. For awards with performance conditions, we recognize the compensation expense over the requisite service period as determined by a range of probability weighted outcomes. For awards with market and or performance conditions, all compensation expense is recognized if it is probable that the underlying market or performance conditions will be fulfilled. 40 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates. Our market risk exposure is primarily a result of fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. We do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. Foreign Currency Exchange Risk. We currently generate a significant portion of our net revenue in Canada. The reporting currency for our consolidated financial statements is the U.S. dollar. Historically, our operations were based largely in Canada. As of February 3, 2013, we operated 51 stores in Canada. As a result, we have been impacted by changes in exchange rates and may be impacted materially for the foreseeable future. As we recognize net revenue from sales in Canada in Canadian dollars, and the U.S. dollar has strengthened during fiscal 2012, it has had a negative impact on our Canadian operating results upon translation of those results into U.S. dollars for the purposes of consolidation. However, the loss in net revenue was partially offset by lower cost of sales and lower selling, general and administrative expenses that are generated in Canadian dollars. A 10% depreciation in the relative value of the Canadian dollar compared to the U.S. dollar would have resulted in lost income from operations of approximately $28.0 million in fiscal 2012 and approximately $15.4 million in fiscal 2011. To the extent the ratio between our net revenue generated in Canadian dollars increases as compared to our expenses generated in Canadian dollars, we expect that our results of operations will be further impacted by changes in exchange rates. A portion of our net revenue is generated in Australia. A 10% depreciation in the relative value of the Australian dollar compared to the U.S. dollar would have resulted in lost income from operations of approximately $0.9 million in fiscal 2012 and $0.4 million in fiscal 2011. We do not currently hedge foreign currency fluctuations. However, in the future, in an effort to mitigate losses associated with these risks, we may at times enter into derivative financial instruments, although we have not historically done so. We do not, and do not intend to, engage in the practice of trading derivative securities for profit. Interest Rate Risk. In April 2007, we entered into an uncommitted senior secured demand revolving credit facility with Royal Bank of Canada. The revolving credit facility provides us with available borrowings in an amount up to CDN$20.0 million. Because our revolving credit facility bears interest at a variable rate, we will be exposed to market risks relating to changes in interest rates, if we have a meaningful outstanding balance. As of February 3, 2013, we had no outstanding borrowings under our revolving facility. We had small outstanding balances under our revolving facility during fiscal 2012 as we built inventory and working capital for the holiday selling season, but we do not believe we are significantly exposed to changes in interest rate risk. We currently do not engage in any interest rate hedging activity and currently have no intention to do so in the foreseeable future. However, in the future, if we have a meaningful outstanding balance under our revolving facility, in an effort to mitigate losses associated with these risks, we may at times enter into derivative financial instruments, although we have not historically done so. These may take the form of forward sales contracts, option contracts, and interest rate swaps. We do not, and do not intend to, engage in the practice of trading derivative securities for profit. Inflation Inflationary factors such as increases in the cost of our product and overhead costs may adversely affect our operating results. Although we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations to date, a high rate of inflation in the future may have an adverse effect on our ability to maintain current levels of gross margin and selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenue if the selling prices of our products do not increase with these increased costs. 41 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 21:53:27.448747
1397187,LULU,lululemon athletica inc.,2014,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThis discussion summarizes our consolidated operating results, financial condition and liquidity during the three-year period ending February 2, 2014. Our fiscal year ends on the Sunday closest to January 31 of the following year, typically resulting in a 52 week year, but occasionally giving rise to an additional week, resulting in a 53 week year. Fiscal 2013 is a 52 week year whereas fiscal 2012 was a 53 week year. Net sales numbers for fiscal 2012 include results from the 53rd week; however, comparable stores sales calculations exclude the 53rd week. Fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011 ended on February 2, 2014, February 3, 2013 and January 29, 2012, respectively. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements based on current expectations that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions, such as our plans, objectives, expectations and intentions set forth in the ""Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements."" Our actual results and the timing of events may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth in the ""Item 1A—Risk Factors"" section and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.OverviewFiscal 2013 was a year of challenges for lululemon. While we were able to grow year over year revenue across all of our selling channels, we also faced challenges with product quality and brand perception. We remain committed to our brand and core values, and have continued to invest in our product engine and supply chain throughout fiscal 2013. In addition, we recently hired a new Chief Executive Officer and a new Chief Product Officer, who we believe will lead our continued profitable growth.In mid-March 2013, we determined that certain shipments of women's black Luon bottoms received from our factories and available in our stores from March 1, 2013, did not meet our specifications. As we became aware of this issue, we pulled what we believe to be all of the affected items from our stores, showrooms and e-commerce sites and began working with our supplier to replace the fabric and with our other manufacturers to replace these items as quickly as possible. As we previously disclosed, the lost revenue, as well as additional costs incurred and the write down of affected product on hand from this issue, negatively impacted our results from operations in fiscal 2013. However, we are proud of our organization’s ability to get Luon delivered back into our stores within 90 days of having pulled it from our line. We believe our brand is recognized as premium in our offerings of women and men's run and yoga assortment, as well as a leader in technical fabrics and functionality. Delivering quality to our customers is a critical factor in our market place differentiation. We believe removing items that do not meet our standards is key to maintaining our brand reputation and that the pull-back of black Luon pants reiterates our commitment to quality. We have continued to invest in new and legacy information technology systems to develop new capabilities to support our vertical retail strategy. In addition, we have continued to strengthen our senior management team in the areas of sourcing, quality and commercialization with key hires during the year. Throughout fiscal 2013, we were able to grow our e-commerce business which we believe has further increased our brand awareness and has made our product available in new markets, including those outside of North America. While the pull-back of black Luon pants from our e-commerce sites negatively affected sales, net revenue from our direct to consumer channel increased 33% and represented 16.5% of total revenue in fiscal 2013 compared to 14.4% of total revenue in fiscal 2012 and 10.6% of total revenue in fiscal 2011. Continuing increases in traffic on our e-commerce website lead us to believe that there is potential for our direct to consumer segment to become an increasingly substantial part of our business and we plan to continue to commit a significant portion of our resources to further developing this channel.We increased our store base through execution of our real estate strategy, when and where we saw opportunities for success. For example, we opened 43 net new corporate-owned stores in North America and Australia during fiscal 2013. Where we find opportunities for growth through opening showrooms, or other community presence efforts, we expect to expand our store base and therefore our business. Our growth strategy relies on expansion in North America, particularly in the United States. We also believe that international growth is an opportunity and are expanding our foothold in markets by establishing local community connections, distributing to strategic sales partners and opening showrooms where we believe our guests are shopping.Fiscal 2014 will be an investment year, as we refocus on building a solid foundation to drive growth and expand our business. In addition to our plans for domestic and international expansion, we are also focused on initiatives related to rebuilding our brand experience, connecting with our guests and communities, and creating innovative, technical and beautiful product. We continue to invest in our product quality and supply chain, as we believe this is the foundation of our guest loyalty. 20Table of ContentsOur focus on building foundation will also extend to our other categories, including our men’s and ivivva business, where we see potential for future expansion. We believe our strong cash flow generation, solid balance sheet and healthy liquidity provide us with the financial flexibility to execute the initiatives which will continue to lead our profitable growth. Operating Segment Overviewlululemon is a designer and retailer of technical athletic apparel operating primarily in North America and Australia. Our yoga-inspired apparel is marketed under the lululemon athletica and ivivva athletica brand names. We offer a comprehensive line of apparel and accessories including pants, shorts, tops and jackets designed for athletic pursuits such as yoga, running and general fitness, and dance-inspired apparel for female youth. As of February 2, 2014, our branded apparel was principally sold through 254 corporate-owned stores that are located in the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand and via our e-commerce websites through our direct to consumer sales channel. We believe our vertical retail strategy allows us to interact more directly with and gain insights from our customers while providing us with greater control of our brand. In fiscal 2013, 66% of our net revenue was derived from sales of our products in the United States, 29% of our net revenue was derived from sales of our products in Canada and 5% of our net revenue was derived from sales of our products outside of North America. In fiscal 2012, 61% of our net revenue was derived from sales of our products in the United States, 34% of our net revenue was derived from sales of our products in Canada and 5% of our net revenue was derived from sales of our products outside of North America. In fiscal 2011, 53% of our net revenue was derived from sales of our products in the United States, 43% of our net revenue was derived from sales of our products in Canada and 4% of our net revenue was derived from sales of our products outside of North America.Our net revenue increased from $1.4 billion in fiscal 2012 to $1.6 billion in fiscal 2013, representing an annual growth rate of 16%. Our increase in net revenue from fiscal 2012 to fiscal 2013 resulted from the addition of 43 net new retail locations, and comparable store sales growth of 2% in fiscal 2013, excluding the impact of the 53rd week in fiscal 2012. Our total comparable sales, which includes comparable store sales and direct to consumer, were 7% in fiscal 2013, excluding the impact of the 53rd week in fiscal 2012. Our ability to open new stores and grow sales in existing stores has been driven by increasing demand for our technical athletic apparel and a growing recognition of the lululemon athletica brand. We believe our superior products, strategic store locations, inviting store environment and distinctive corporate culture are responsible for our strong financial performance.We have three reportable segments: corporate-owned stores, direct to consumer and other. We report our segments based on the financial information we use in managing our businesses. While we receive financial information for each corporate-owned store, we have aggregated all of the corporate-owned stores into one reportable segment due to the similarities in the economic and other characteristics of these stores. As of February 2, 2014, we sold our products through 254 corporate-owned stores located in the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. We plan to increase our net revenue in North America and Australia by opening additional corporate-owned stores in new and existing markets. Corporate-owned stores accounted for 77.3% of total net revenue in fiscal 2013, 79.6% of total net revenue in fiscal 2012 and 81.6% of total net revenue in fiscal 2011.As of February 2, 2014, our direct to consumer segment included our lululemon and ivivva e-commerce websites. E-commerce sales are taken directly from retail customers through www.lululemon.com and www.ivivva.com and other country and region specific websites. Our direct to consumer segment is an increasingly substantial part of our growth strategy, and now represents 16.5% of our net revenue compared to 14.4% in fiscal 2012 and 10.6% in fiscal 2011.In addition to deriving revenue from sales through our corporate-owned stores and direct to consumer, we also derive other net revenue, which includes outlet, wholesale, and warehouse sales and as well as sales through a number of company-operated showrooms and temporary locations. Outlets as well as warehouse sales, which are typically held one or more times a year, are both to sell slow moving inventory or inventory from prior seasons to retail customers at discounted prices. Wholesale customers include select premium yoga studios, health clubs and fitness centers. Our showrooms are typically small locations that we open from time to time when we enter new markets and feature a limited selection of our product offering during select hours. Our temporary locations are typically opened for the holiday season in markets in which we may not already have a presence. We reacquired our four remaining franchise stores during fiscal 2011, and as such, franchise sales, which included inventory sales and royalties, are no longer a part of our other net revenue. Other net revenue accounted for 6.2% of total revenue in fiscal 2013 compared to 6.0% in fiscal 2012 and 7.8% of total net revenue in fiscal 2011.We believe that our athletic apparel has and will continue to appeal to consumers outside of North America who value its technical attributes as well as its function and style. In 2004, we opened our first store in Australia which was operated under a franchise license. In fiscal 2009 we made a 13% equity investment in lululemon athletica australia Pty, our franchise operator. During fiscal 2010 we increased our investment to 80% which provided us with control over lululemon athletica australia Pty. During fiscal 2012 we purchased the remaining non-controlling interest in lululemon athletica australia Pty. In fiscal 2008, we 21Table of Contentsopened our first company-operated showroom in Hong Kong and in fiscal 2012 we opened our first company-operated showroom in the United Kingdom. In fiscal 2013 we opened additional showrooms in Hong Kong and the United Kingdom, and opened showrooms for the first time in Germany, Singapore, the Netherlands, and China.Basis of PresentationNet revenue is comprised of:•corporate-owned store net revenue, which includes sales to customers through corporate-owned stores in the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand;•direct to consumer revenue, which includes sales from our e-commerce websites; and•other net revenue, which includes wholesale accounts, franchise sales, warehouse sales, outlets and sales from company-operated showrooms.in each case, net of an estimated allowance for sales returns and discounts.In addition, we separately track comparable store sales, which reflect net revenue at corporate-owned stores that have been open for at least 12 months. Therefore, net revenue from a store is included in comparable store sales beginning with the first month for which the store has a full month of comparable prior year sales. Non-comparable store sales include sales from new stores that have not been open or otherwise not operated by us for 12 months or from stores which have been significantly remodeled or relocated. Also included in non-comparable stores sales are sales from direct to consumer sales, outlets, wholesale, warehouse sales, showrooms, temporary locations, franchises, and sales from corporate-owned stores which we have closed. The 53rd week of fiscal 2012 is excluded from the calculation of comparable store sales. We began to report total comparable sales in fiscal 2013, which combines comparable store sales and direct to consumer sales, excluding the 53rd week of sales from fiscal 2012. Our direct to consumer segment represents a growing portion of our net revenue as the shopping behavior of our guests evolves. Our approach to our guests supports this as it involves country and region specific websites, mobile/tablet devices in stores, social networks, and product notification emails. We therefore believe that reporting total comparable sales with comparable store sales and direct to consumer sales combined provides a more relevant metric, and we intend to continue reporting this in fiscal 2014.By measuring the change in year-over-year net revenue in stores that have been open for 12 months or more as well as direct to consumer sales, total comparable sales allow us to evaluate our performance eliminating the impact of newly opened stores. Various factors affect comparable sales, including:•the location of new stores relative to existing stores;•consumer preferences, buying trends and overall economic trends;•our ability to anticipate and respond effectively to customer preferences for technical athletic apparel;•competition;•changes in our merchandise mix;•pricing;•the timing of our releases of new merchandise and promotional events;•the effectiveness of our grassroots marketing efforts;•the level of customer service that we provide in our stores and on our websites;•our ability to source and distribute products efficiently; and•the number of stores we open, close (including for temporary renovations) and expand in any period.Opening new stores is an important part of our growth strategy. Accordingly, total comparable sales has limited utility for assessing the success of our growth strategy insofar as comparable sales do not reflect the performance of stores open less than 12 months.Cost of goods sold includes:•the cost of purchased merchandise, which includes acquisition and production costs including raw material and labor, as applicable;22Table of Contents•the cost incurred to deliver inventory to our distribution centers including freight, non-refundable taxes, duty and other landing costs;•the cost of our distribution centers (such as labor, rent and utilities) and the depreciation related to our distribution centers;•the cost of our production, merchandise and design departments including salaries, stock-based compensation and benefits, and operating expenses;•the cost of occupancy related to store operations (such as rent and utilities) and the depreciation related to store-level capital expenditures;•hemming; and•shrink and valuation reserves.Cost of goods sold also may change as we open or close stores because of the resulting change in related occupancy costs. The primary drivers of the costs of individual goods are the costs of raw materials and labor in the countries where we source our merchandise.Selling, general and administrative expenses consist of all operating costs not otherwise included in cost of goods sold. Our selling, general and administrative expenses include marketing costs, accounting costs, information technology costs, human resource costs, professional fees, corporate facility costs, corporate and store-level payroll and benefits expenses, stock-based compensation and occupancy, depreciation and amortization expense for all assets other than depreciation expenses related to store-level capital expenditures and our distribution centers, each of which are included in cost of goods sold. We anticipate that our selling, general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars due to anticipated continued growth of our corporate support staff and store-level employees.Other income (expense), net includes interest earned on our cash balances and interest costs associated with our credit facilities and with letters of credit drawn under these facilities for the purchase of merchandise. We expect to continue to generate interest income to the extent that our cash generated from operations exceeds our cash used for investment. We have maintained relatively small outstanding balances on our credit facilities and expect to continue to do so for the foreseeable future.Provision for income taxes depends on the statutory tax rates in the countries where we sell our products. Historically we had generated taxable income in Canada and we had generated tax losses in the United States. In fiscal 2010 we earned taxable income in the United States and fully utilized any net operating losses available from prior periods. We anticipate continued growth in the United States and consequently foresee an increase in taxable income reported. We have recorded net deferred tax assets in respect of deductible temporary differences of $14.3 million.Our effective tax rates for fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012 were lower than our effective tax rate for fiscal 2011 primarily due to the ongoing impact of revised intercompany pricing agreements. Our effective tax rate in fiscal 2013 was 29.6%, compared to 28.8% in fiscal 2012 and 36.1% in fiscal 2011.We anticipate that in the future we may start to sell our products directly to some customers located in countries that we have not yet operated in, in which case we would become subject to taxation based on the foreign statutory rates in the countries where these sales take place and our effective tax rate could fluctuate accordingly.23Table of ContentsResults of OperationsThe following tables summarize key components of our results of operations for the periods indicated, both in dollars and as a percentage of net revenue: Fiscal Year Ended February 2, 2014 February 3, 2013 January 29, 2012 (In thousands)Consolidated statements of operations: Net revenue $1,591,188 $1,370,358 $1,000,839Cost of goods sold 751,112 607,532 431,488Gross profit 840,076 762,826 569,351Selling, general and administrative expenses 448,718 386,387 282,393Income from operations 391,358 376,439 286,958Other income (expense), net 5,768 4,957 2,500Income before provision for income taxes 397,126 381,396 289,458Provision for income taxes 117,579 109,965 104,494Net income 279,547 271,431 184,964Net income attributable to non-controlling interest — 875 901Net income attributable to lululemon athletica inc. $279,547 $270,556 $184,063 Fiscal Year Ended February 2, 2014 February 3, 2013 January 29, 2012 (% of net revenue)Net revenue 100.0 100.0 100.0Cost of goods sold 47.2 44.3 43.1Gross profit 52.8 55.7 56.9Selling, general and administrative expenses 28.2 28.2 28.2Income from operations 24.6 27.5 28.7Other income (expense), net 0.4 0.3 0.2Income before provision for income taxes 25.0 27.8 28.9Provision for income taxes 7.4 8.0 10.4Net income 17.6 19.8 18.5Net income attributable to non-controlling interest — 0.1 0.1Net income attributable to lululemon athletica inc. 17.6 19.7 18.4Comparison of Fiscal 2013 to Fiscal 2012 Net RevenueNet revenue increased $220.8 million, or 16%, to $1.591 billion in fiscal 2013 from $1.370 billion in fiscal 2012. Assuming the average exchange rates in fiscal 2013 remained constant with the average exchange rates in fiscal 2012, our net revenue would have increased $247.0 million, or 18%. Total comparable sales, including comparable stores and direct to consumer, increased 7% in fiscal 2013, or 9% excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations.The net revenue increase was driven by sales from new stores opened, the growth of our direct to consumer segment, and increased sales at locations in our comparable stores base. The constant dollar increase in comparable store sales was driven primarily by the strength of our existing product lines, successful introduction of new products and increasing recognition of the lululemon athletica brand name, especially at our U.S. stores, that drove higher transactions per store in the United States.24Table of ContentsOur net revenue on a segment basis for fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012 are expressed in dollar amounts as well as relevant percentages, presented as a percentage of total net revenue below. Fiscal Year Ended February 2, 2014 and February 3, 2013 2013 2012 2013 2012 (In thousands) (Percentages)Corporate-owned stores $1,228,999 $1,090,181 77.3 79.6Direct to consumer 263,083 197,255 16.5 14.4Other 99,106 82,922 6.2 6.0Net revenue $1,591,188 $1,370,358 100.0 100.0Corporate-Owned Stores. Net revenue from our corporate-owned stores segment increased $138.8 million, or 13%, to $1.229 billion in fiscal 2013 from $1.090 billion in fiscal 2012. The following contributed to the increase in net revenue from our corporate-owned stores segment:•Net revenue from corporate-owned stores we opened during fiscal 2013, and during fiscal 2012 prior to sales from such stores becoming part of our comparable stores base, contributed $138.0 million of the increase. New store openings in fiscal 2013 included three stores in Canada, including one ivivva branded store, 36 stores in the United States, including three ivivva branded stores, two stores in Australia, and two stores in New Zealand; and•Comparable store sales increase of 2% in fiscal 2013 resulted in a $19.5 million increase to net revenue, including the effect of foreign currency fluctuations. Excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations, comparable store sales increased 4%, or $37.3 million, in fiscal 2013.The increase in net revenue was partially offset by $18.7 million of revenue from the 53rd week of fiscal 2012, which was excluded in the calculation of comparable store sales.Direct to Consumer. Net revenue from our direct to consumer segment increased $65.8 million, or 33%, to $263.1 million in fiscal 2013 from $197.3 million in fiscal 2012, including $4.2 million of net revenue from the 53rd week of fiscal 2012. The increase in net revenue from our direct to consumer segment was a result of increasing traffic on our e-commerce websites.Other. Net revenue from our other segment increased $16.2 million, or 20%, to $99.1 million in fiscal 2013 from $82.9 million in fiscal 2012, including $3.3 million of net revenue from the 53rd week of fiscal 2012. The increase in net revenue from our other segment was primarily due to increased sales from our outlets and showrooms sales channels. We continue to employ our other segment strategy to increase interest in our product in markets where we may not have corporate-owned stores.Gross ProfitGross profit increased $77.2 million, or 10%, to $840.1 million in fiscal 2013 from $762.8 million in fiscal 2012. Increased net revenue in all of our operating segments resulted in an increased gross profit. A $17.5 million charge related to the pull-back of black Luon pants was recorded in cost of sales during fiscal 2013.The increase in gross profit was partially offset by increases in fixed costs, such as occupancy costs and depreciation, as well as increased costs related to our design, merchandising, and production departments.Gross profit, as a percentage of net revenue, or gross margin, decreased 290 basis points, to 52.8% in fiscal 2013 from 55.7% in fiscal 2012. The decrease in gross margin resulted primarily from:•a decrease in product margin of 200 basis points due to a lower sales mix of higher margin core items related to the pull-back of black Luon pants, along with higher markdowns and an increase in provision for inventories charged to cost of sales; and•a non-recurring charge of 110 basis points related to the pull-back of black Luon pants in the first quarter of fiscal 2013.The decrease in gross margin was partially offset by a decrease in expenses related to our product and supply chain departments, relative to the increase in net revenue, and by leverage on fixed costs, such as depreciation and occupancy costs, which together contributed to an increase in gross margin of 20 basis points.25Table of ContentsSelling, General and Administrative ExpensesSelling, general and administrative expenses increased $62.3 million, or 16%, to $448.7 million in fiscal 2013 from $386.4 million in fiscal 2012. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was principally comprised of:•an increase in employee costs of $25.3 million as we experience natural growth in labor hours associated with new and existing corporate-owned stores, outlets, showrooms and other, as well as an increase in wages as we invest in our employees;•an increase in variable store costs of $9.5 million as a result of increased sales volume from new and existing corporate-owned stores, outlets, showrooms and other;•an increase in variable costs such as distribution costs, credit card fees and packaging related to our direct to consumer segment of $7.3 million as a result of increased sales volume;•an increase in administrative costs related to our direct to consumer segment of $5.3 million associated with the growth in this channel and increased head count to support it;•an increase in head office employee costs of $5.7 million from increased head count incurred in order to position us for long-term growth, partially offset by decreased management incentive-based compensation and stock-based compensation;•an increase in other head office costs of $17.5 million as a result of the overall growth of our business and investment in strategic initiatives and projects; and•an increase in other costs, including occupancy costs and depreciation not included in cost of goods sold, of $9.6 million as a result of the expansion of our business and in order to position us for long-term growth.The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was partially offset by a $17.9 million increase in net foreign exchange gains which were primarily from our Canadian operating entity.As a percentage of net revenue, selling, general and administrative expenses remained unchanged at 28.2% in both fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012.We expect selling, general and administrative expenses to increase throughout fiscal 2014 as we add administrative and sales personnel and increase our infrastructure to support the growth in our store base.Income from OperationsIncome from operations increased $14.9 million, or 4%, to $391.4 million in fiscal 2013 from $376.4 million in fiscal 2012. The increase was a result of increased gross profit of $77.2 million, partially offset by increased selling, general and administrative costs of $62.3 million. The increase in selling, general and administrative costs was primarily driven by the increase in our business, as seen in our net revenue increases.On a segment basis, we determine income from operations without taking into account our general corporate expenses. We have reviewed our general corporate expenses and determined some costs previously classified as general corporate are direct segment expenses. Accordingly, all prior year comparable information has been reclassified to conform to the current year classification.Income from operations before general corporate expenses for fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012 are expressed in dollar amounts as well as percentages, presented as a percentage of net revenue of their respective operating segments below.

Income from operations from our corporate-owned stores segment decreased $2.8 million, or 1%, to $372.6 million for fiscal 2013 from $375.5 million for fiscal 2012 primarily due to an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses related to employee costs as well as operating expenses associated with new stores and a $17.5 million charge related to the pull-back of black Luon pants, which was partially offset by an increase of $36.9 million in gross profit. Income from operations as a percentage of corporate-owned stores revenue decreased by 410 basis points primarily from a decrease in gross margin due to a lower mix of higher margin core items related to the pull-back of black Luon pants.Direct to consumer. Income from operations from our direct to consumer segment increased $24.9 million, or 29%, to $109.6 million in fiscal 2013 from $84.7 million in fiscal 2012 due to increased sales through our e-commerce website, with gross profit increasing $36.0 million over fiscal 2012. Income from operations as a percentage of direct to consumer revenue decreased by 130 basis points in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012.Other. Income from operations from our other segment decreased $3.8 million, or 19%, to $16.1 million in fiscal 2013 from $19.9 million in fiscal 2012. We continue to employ our other segment strategy to increase interest in our product in markets we have not otherwise entered with corporate-owned stores.General Corporate Expense. General corporate expenses increased $3.3 million, or 3%, to $107.0 million in fiscal 2013 from $103.6 million in fiscal 2012. This increase was primarily due to an increase in expenses related to our head office growth of $28.9 million, which was largely related to the growth of our of our information technology and human resources departments as well as the overall growth of our business, and increased professional fees related to investment in strategic initiatives and projects. Increased depreciation and amortization expense of $3.3 million also contributed to the increase in general corporate expense. The increase in general corporate expense was offset by an increase of $17.9 million in net foreign exchange gains which were primarily from our Canadian operating entity as well as decreased management incentive-based compensation of $5.0 million and decreased stock-based compensation expense of $4.9 million. General corporate expenses are expected to continue to increase in future years as we grow our overall business and require increased efforts at our head office to support our corporate-owned stores, direct to consumer and other segments.Other Income (Expense), NetOther income (expense), net increased $0.8 million, to $5.8 million in fiscal 2013 from $5.0 million in fiscal 2012. The increase was primarily a result of increased interest income earned in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 on our increased cash balances.Provision for Income TaxesProvision for income taxes increased $7.6 million, or 7%, to $117.6 million in fiscal 2013 from $110.0 million in fiscal 2012. In fiscal 2013, our effective tax rate was 29.6% compared to 28.8% in fiscal 2012.Net IncomeNet income increased $9.0 million, or 3%, to $279.5 million in fiscal 2013 from $270.6 million in fiscal 2012. The increase in net income in fiscal 2013 was primarily due to a $77.2 million increase in gross profit resulting from sales growth at existing and additional corporate-owned stores opened during fiscal 2013 and increasing traffic on our e-commerce website and the addition of regional websites and a $0.8 million increase in other income (expense), net, offset by an increase of $62.3 million in selling, general and administrative expenses, and an increase of $7.6 million in provision for income taxes.Comparison of Fiscal 2012 to Fiscal 2011Net RevenueNet revenue increased $369.5 million, or 37%, to $1,370.4 million in fiscal 2012 from $1,000.8 million in fiscal 2011. Assuming the average exchange rates in fiscal 2012 remained constant with the average exchange rates in fiscal 2011, our net revenue would have increased $370.5 million, or 37%.The net revenue increase was driven by increased sales at locations in our comparable stores base, sales from new stores opened, and the growth of our direct to consumer segment. The constant dollar increase in comparable store sales was driven primarily by the strength of our existing product lines, successful introduction of new products and increasing recognition of the lululemon athletica brand name, especially at our U.S. stores, that drove higher transactions per store. 27Table of ContentsOur net revenue on a segment basis for fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011 are expressed in dollar amounts as well as relevant percentages, presented as a percentage of total net revenue below. Fiscal Year Ended February 3, 2013 and January 29, 2012 2012 2011 2012 2011 (In thousands) (Percentages)Corporate-owned stores $1,090,181 $816,925 79.6 81.6Direct to consumer 197,255 106,313 14.4 10.6Other 82,922 77,601 6.0 7.8Net revenue $1,370,358 $1,000,839 100.0 100.0Corporate-Owned Stores. Net revenue from our corporate-owned stores segment increased $273.3 million, or 33%, to $1,090.2 million in fiscal 2012 from $816.9 million in fiscal 2011. The following contributed to the increase in net revenue from our corporate-owned stores segment: •Comparable store sales increase of 16% in fiscal 2012 resulted in a $118.3 million increase to net revenue, including the effect of foreign currency fluctuations. Excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations, comparable store sales increased 16%, or $119.3 million, in fiscal 2012; •Net revenue from corporate-owned stores we opened during fiscal 2012, and during fiscal 2011 prior to sales from such stores becoming part of our comparable stores base, contributed $136.3 million of the increase. New store openings in fiscal 2012 included four stores in Canada, including three ivivva branded stores, 27 stores in the United States, five in Australia, and one in New Zealand; and •Net revenue of $18.7 million from the 53rd week of fiscal 2012, which was excluded in the calculation of comparable store sales. Direct to Consumer. Net revenue from our direct to consumer segment increased $90.9 million, or 86%, to $197.3 million in fiscal 2012 from $106.3 million in fiscal 2011, including $4.2 million of net revenue from the 53rd week of fiscal 2012. The increase in net revenue from our direct to consumer segment was a result of increasing traffic, conversion rates and average order value on our e-commerce website, as well as making our products available in new markets outside of North America. Other. Net revenue from our other segment increased $5.3 million, or 7%, to $82.9 million in fiscal 2012 from $77.6 million in fiscal 2011. The increase in net revenue from our other segment was primarily due to increased sales from our outlets and showrooms sales channels. The increase was partially offset by decreased net revenue from wholesale. In addition, we reacquired our four remaining franchise stores during fiscal 2011, therefore revenue from these stores is now included in our corporate-owned stores segment. We continue to employ our other segment strategy to increase interest in our product in markets where we may not have corporate-owned stores. Gross Profit Gross profit increased $193.5 million, or 34%, to $762.8 million in fiscal 2012 from $569.4 million in fiscal 2011. Increased net revenue in most of our operating segments resulted in an increased gross profit. The increase in gross profit was partially offset by increases in fixed costs, such as occupancy costs and depreciation, as well as increased costs related to our design, merchandising, and production departments. Gross profit, as a percentage of net revenue, or gross margin, decreased 120 basis points, to 55.7% in fiscal 2012 from 56.9% in fiscal 2011. The decrease in gross margin resulted primarily from: •an increase in product costs of 200 basis points due to increased labor and raw materials costs related to increased product innovation, function and garment complexity, as well as an increase in markdowns and discounts due to a more balanced inventory position in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011; •an increase in expenses related to our product and supply chain departments, relative to the increase in net revenue, which had a deleveraging effect on gross margin of 30 basis points. The decrease in gross margin was partially offset by: •a decrease in air freight of 60 basis points due to lower air freight usage than in fiscal 2011; and 28Table of Contents•a decrease in fixed costs, such as occupancy costs and depreciation, relative to the increase in net revenue, which had a leveraging effect on gross margin of 50 basis points. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $104.0 million, or 37%, to $386.4 million in fiscal 2012 from $282.4 million in fiscal 2011. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was principally comprised of: •an increase in employee costs of $39.2 million as we experience natural growth in labor hours associated with new and existing corporate-owned stores, outlets, showrooms and other, as well as an increase in wages as we invest in our employees;•an increase in variable store costs of $7.0 million as a result of increased sales volume from new and existing corporate-owned stores, outlets, showrooms and other; •an increase in variable costs such as distribution costs, credit card fees and packaging related to our direct to consumer segment of $10.2 million as a result of increased sales volume; •an increase in administrative costs related to our direct to consumer segment of $8.0 million associated with the growth in this channel and increased head count to support it; •an increase in head office employee costs, including stock-based compensation expense and management incentive-based compensation, of $18.9 million from increased head count incurred in order to position us for long-term growth; •an increase in other head office costs of $11.2 million as a result of the overall growth of our business and investment in strategic initiatives and projects; and •an increase in other costs, including occupancy costs and depreciation not included in cost of goods sold, of $9.5 million as a result of the expansion of our business and in order to position us for long-term growth. As a percentage of net revenue, selling, general and administrative expenses remained unchanged at 28.2% in both fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011. We expect selling, general and administrative expenses to increase throughout fiscal 2013 as we add administrative and sales personnel and increase our infrastructure to support the growth in our store base. Income from Operations Income from operations increased $89.5 million, or 31%, to $376.4 million in fiscal 2012 from $287.0 million in fiscal 2011. The increase was a result of increased gross profit of $193.5 million, partially offset by increased selling, general and administrative costs of $104.0 million. The increase in selling, general and administrative costs was primarily driven by the increase in our business, as seen in our net revenue increases. On a segment basis, we determine income from operations without taking into account our general corporate expenses. We have reviewed our general corporate expenses and determined some costs previously classified as general corporate are direct segment expenses. Accordingly, all prior year comparable information has been reclassified to conform to the current year classification. Income from operations before general corporate expenses for fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011 are expressed in dollar amounts as well as percentages, presented as a percentage of net revenue of their respective operating segments below. Fiscal Year Ended February 3, 2013 and January 29, 2012 2012 2011 2012 2011 (In thousands) (Percentages)Corporate-owned stores $375,461 $297,809 34.4 36.5Direct to consumer 84,677 44,175 42.9 41.6Other 19,928 21,103 24.0 27.2Income from operations before general corporate expense 480,066 363,087 General corporate expense 103,627 76,129 Income from operations $376,439 $286,958 Corporate-Owned Stores. Income from operations from our corporate-owned stores segment increased $77.7 million, or 26%, to $375.5 million for fiscal 2012 from $297.8 million for fiscal 2011 primarily due to an increase of $137.1 million in 29Table of Contentsgross profit, which was offset partially by a natural increase in selling, general and administrative expenses related to employee costs as well as operating expenses associated with new stores and net revenue growth at existing stores. Income from operations as a percentage of corporate-owned stores revenue decreased by 210 basis points primarily from a decrease in gross margin related to increased product costs. Direct to consumer. Income from operations from our direct to consumer segment increased $40.5 million, or 92%, to $84.7 million in fiscal 2012 from $44.2 million in fiscal 2011 due to increased sales through our e-commerce website and the addition of regional websites, with gross profit increasing $56.2 million over fiscal 2011. Income from operations as a percentage of direct to consumer revenue increased by 130 basis points in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 due to leverage on fixed costs. Other. Income from operations from our other segment decreased $1.2 million, or 6%, to $19.9 million in fiscal 2012 from $21.1 million in fiscal 2011. The decrease was primarily the result of our reacquisition of our four remaining franchise stores during fiscal 2011, as revenue from these stores is now included in our corporate-owned stores segment. We continue to employ our other segment strategy to increase interest in our product in markets we have not otherwise entered with corporate-owned stores. General Corporate Expense. General corporate expenses increased $27.5 million, or 36%, to $103.6 million in fiscal 2012 from $76.1 million in fiscal 2011. This increase was primarily due to an increase in expenses related to our head office growth of $19.4 million, which was largely related to the growth of our information technology department for systems implementations and infrastructure investments, our human resources department as a result of the overall growth of our business, and increased professional fees related to investment in strategic initiatives and projects. General corporate expenses also increased as a result of increased stock-based compensation expense of $4.7 million and increased depreciation and amortization expense of $3.3 million. General corporate expenses are expected to continue to increase in future years as we grow our overall business and require increased efforts at our head office to support our corporate-owned stores, direct to consumer and other segments. Other Income (Expense), Net Other income (expense), net increased $2.5 million, to $5.0 million in fiscal 2012 from $2.5 million in fiscal 2011. The increase was primarily a result of increased interest income earned in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 on our increased cash balances. Provision for Income Taxes Provision for income taxes increased $5.5 million, or 5%, to $110.0 million in fiscal 2012 from $104.5 million in fiscal 2011. In fiscal 2012, our effective tax rate was 28.8% compared to 36.1% in fiscal 2011. The lower effective tax rate was due to the ongoing impact of revised intercompany pricing agreements. Net Income Net income increased $86.5 million, or 47%, to $270.6 million in fiscal 2012 from $184.1 million in fiscal 2011. The increase in net income in fiscal 2012 was primarily due to a $193.5 million increase in gross profit resulting from sales growth at existing and additional corporate-owned stores opened during fiscal 2012 and increasing traffic on our e-commerce website and the addition of regional websites and a $2.5 million increase in other income (expense), net, offset by an increase of $104.0 million in selling, general and administrative expenses, and an increase of $5.5 million in provision for income taxes. Liquidity and Capital ResourcesOur primary sources of liquidity are our current balances of cash and cash equivalents, cash flows from operations and borrowings available under our revolving credit facility. Our primary cash needs are capital expenditures for opening new stores and remodeling existing stores, making information technology system enhancements and funding working capital requirements. Cash and cash equivalents in excess of our needs are held in interest bearing accounts with financial institutions.As of February 2, 2014, our working capital (excluding cash and cash equivalents) was $130.7 million and our cash and cash equivalents were $698.6 million.The following table summarizes our net cash flows provided by and used in operating, investing and financing activities for the periods indicated:30Table of Contents Fiscal Year Ended February 2, 2014 February 3, 2013 January 29, 2012 (In thousands)Total cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $278,339 $280,113 $203,615Investing activities (106,408) (93,229) (122,311)Financing activities 8,907 (5,491) 15,364Effect of exchange rate changes (72,368) (651) (3,517)Increase in cash and cash equivalents $108,470 $180,742 $93,151Operating ActivitiesOperating Activities consist primarily of net income adjusted for certain non-cash items, including provision for inventories, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense and the effect of changes in non-cash working capital items, principally accounts payable, inventories, prepaid expenses, income taxes payable, and accrued compensation and related expenses.In fiscal 2013, cash provided by operating activities decreased $1.8 million, to $278.3 million compared to cash provided by operating activities of $280.1 million in fiscal 2012. The decrease was primarily a result of a decrease in income taxes payable and accrued compensation and related benefits, partially offset by increased accounts payable. The net increase in items not affecting cash was primarily due to an increase in depreciation related to our increased store base.Depreciation and amortization relate almost entirely to leasehold improvements, furniture and fixtures, computer hardware and software, equipment and vehicles in our stores and other corporate buildings.Depreciation and amortization increased $6.1 million to $49.1 million in fiscal 2013 from $43.0 million in fiscal 2012. Depreciation for our corporate-owned store segment was $31.3 million, $27.5 million, and $18.5 million in fiscal 2013, fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011, respectively. Depreciation for our direct to consumer segment was $4.6 million, $3.4 million and $2.4 million in fiscal 2013, fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011, respectively. Depreciation related to corporate activities was $13.1 million, $12.1 million, and $9.4 million fiscal 2013, fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011, respectively. We have not allocated any depreciation to our other segment as these amounts to date have been immaterial.Investing ActivitiesInvesting Activities relate primarily to capital expenditures.Cash used in investing activities increased $13.2 million, to $106.4 million in fiscal 2013 from $93.2 million in fiscal 2012. Capital expenditures for our corporate-owned stores segment were $60.2 million in fiscal 2013 which included $31.3 million to open 45 corporate-owned stores and $64.9 million in fiscal 2012 which included $29.8 million to open 37 corporate-owned stores. The remaining capital expenditures for our corporate-owned stores segment in each period were for ongoing store refurbishment. Capital expenditures for our direct to consumer segment were $6.0 million and $4.9 million in fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012, respectively. Capital expenditures related to corporate activities and administration were $40.2 million and $23.5 million in fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012, respectively. The capital expenditures in each period for corporate activities and administration were for improvements at our head office and other corporate buildings as well as investments in information technology and business systems.Capital expenditures are expected to range between $105 million and $110 million in fiscal 2014, including approximately $35 million for approximately 42 new stores and the remainder reflecting renovation capital for existing stores, information technology enhancements and other corporate activities.Financing ActivitiesFinancing Activities consist primarily of cash received on the exercise of stock options, excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation and cash paid to acquire the remaining non-controlling interest in Australia. Cash provided by financing activities increased $14.4 million, to cash provided of $8.9 million in fiscal 2013 from cash used of $5.5 million in fiscal 2012. The cash used in financing activities for fiscal 2012 included $26.0 million for the purchase of the non-controlling interest in lululemon australia.31Table of ContentsWe believe that our cash from operations and borrowings available to us under our revolving credit facility will be adequate to meet our liquidity needs and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 24 months. Our cash from operations may be negatively impacted by a decrease in demand for our products as well as the other factors described in ""Risk Factors."" In addition, we may make discretionary capital improvements with respect to our stores, distribution facilities, headquarters, or other systems, which we would expect to fund through the issuance of debt or equity securities or other external financing sources to the extent we were unable to fund such capital expenditures out of our cash from operations.Revolving Credit FacilityOn November 22, 2013, we entered into unsecured demand revolving credit facilities with HSBC Bank Canada and Bank of America, N.A., Canada Branch, which replaced our 2007 credit facility. The credit facilities provide us with available borrowings in a total amount of $15.0 million. Borrowings under the credit facilities must be repaid in full on demand and are available by way of U.S. or Canadian denominated advances, letters of credit or depository bills. Advances denominate in U.S. Dollars bear interest on the outstanding balance at a rate equal to U.S. LIBOR plus 100 basis points or the U.S. prime rate, at our option. Advances denominated in Canadian Dollars bear interest on the outstanding balance at a rate equal to the Bankers Acceptance Rate plus 100 basis points or the Canadian prime rate, at our option. Borrowings drawn down under standby letters of credit will bear a fee of 100 basis points and borrowings drawn down under commercial letters of credit will bear the banks' standard pricing. We are also required to pay a quarterly commitment fee of 10 basis points on the unused portion of the facility. Our wholly-owned subsidiary, lululemon usa inc., has provided a guarantee to the bank counter-parties under the facilities. The revolving credit facilities are unsecured, with a negative pledge on assets subject to permitted encumbrances, and no financial covenants. As of February 2, 2014, aside from letters of credit, we had $nil in borrowings outstanding under these credit facilities.Contractual Obligations and CommitmentsLeases. We lease certain corporate-owned store locations, storage spaces, building and equipment under non-cancelable operating leases. Our leases generally have initial terms of between five and 10 years, and generally can be extended only in five-year increments, if at all. Our leases expire at various dates between one and 10 years, excluding extensions at our option. A substantial number of our leases for corporate-owned store premises include renewal options and certain of our leases include rent escalation clauses, rent holidays and leasehold rental incentives, none of which are reflected in the following table. Most of our leases for corporate-owned store premises also include contingent rental payments based on sales volume, the impact of which also are not reflected in the following table. The following table summarizes our contractual arrangements as of February 2, 2014, and the timing and effect that such commitments are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods: Payments Due by Fiscal Year Total 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 Thereafter (In thousands)Operating Leases (minimum rent) $350,168 $70,913 $69,209 $65,421 $54,261 $37,979 $52,385Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsWe enter into standby letters of credit to secure certain of our obligations, including leases, taxes and duties. As of February 2, 2014, letters of credit and letters of guarantee totaling $1.1 million have been issued.Other than these standby letters of credit, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, investments in special purpose entities or undisclosed borrowings or debt. In addition, we have not entered into any derivative contracts or synthetic leases.Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions. Predicting future events is inherently an imprecise activity and, as such, requires the use of judgment. Actual results may vary from estimates in amounts that may be material to the financial statements. An accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically, could materially impact our consolidated financial statements.32Table of ContentsWe believe that the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements:Revenue Recognition. Net revenue is comprised of corporate-owned store net revenue, direct to consumer sales through www.lululemon.com, www.ivivva.com and other country and region specific websites, and other net revenue, which includes, sales to wholesale accounts, warehouse sales, franchise royalties as well as sales of products to franchisees, and sales from company-operated showrooms, in each case, net of an estimated allowance for sales returns and discounts. Sales to customers through corporate-owned stores and company-operated showrooms are recognized at the point of sale, net of an estimated allowance for sales returns. Direct to consumer sales are recognized when goods are shipped and collection is reasonably assured, net of an estimated allowance for sales returns. Other net revenue related to franchise royalties are recognized when earned, in accordance with the terms of the franchise/license agreements. Royalties are based on a percentage of the franchisees' sales and recognized when those sales occur. Other net revenue related to warehouse sales is recognized when these sales occur. Amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling are recognized at the time of shipment.Sales are reported on a net revenue basis, which is computed by deducting from our gross sales the amount of sales taxes, actual product returns received, discounts and an amount established for anticipated sales returns. Our estimated allowance for sales returns is a subjective critical estimate that has a direct impact on reported net revenue. This allowance is calculated based on a history of actual returns, estimated future returns and any significant future known or anticipated events. Consideration of these factors results in an estimated allowance for sales returns. Our standard terms for retail sales limit returns to approximately 14 days after the sale of the merchandise. For our wholesale sales, we allow returns from our wholesale customers if properly requested and approved. Employee discounts are classified as a reduction of net revenue.Revenue from our gift cards are recognized when tendered for payment, or upon redemption. Outstanding customer balances are included in ""Unredeemed gift card liability"" on the consolidated balance sheets. There are no expiration dates on our gift cards, and lululemon does not charge any service fees that cause a decrement to customer balances.While we will continue to honor all gift cards presented for payment, management may determine the likelihood of redemption to be remote for certain card balances due to, among other things, long periods of inactivity. In these circumstances, to the extent management determines there is no requirement for remitting card balances to government agencies under unclaimed property laws, card balances may be recognized in the consolidated statements of operations in ""Net revenue.""Inventory. Inventory is valued at the lower of cost and market. Cost is determined using weighted-average costs. For finished goods, market is defined as net realizable value, and for raw materials, market is defined as replacement cost. Cost of inventories includes acquisition and production costs including raw material and labor, as applicable, and all costs incurred to deliver inventory to our distribution centers including freight, non-refundable taxes, duty and other landing costs.We periodically review our inventories and make provisions as necessary to appropriately value obsolete or damaged goods. The amount of the provision is equal to the difference between the book cost of the inventory and its estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demands, selling prices and market conditions. In addition, as part of inventory valuations, we provide for inventory shrinkage based on historical trends from actual physical inventories. Inventory shrinkage estimates are made to reduce the inventory value for lost or stolen items. We perform physical inventory counts throughout the year and adjust the shrink provision accordingly. In fiscal 2013, we wrote-off $30.2 million of inventory, including $17.5 million related to the pull-back of black Luon pants, and in fiscal 2012 we wrote-off $6.4 million of inventory.Property and Equipment. Property and equipment are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation. Direct internal and external costs related to software used for internal purposes which are incurred during the application development stage or for upgrades that add functionality are capitalized. All other costs related to internal use software are expensed as incurred. Buildings are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the expected useful life of the asset, which ranges from 10 to 20 years. Leasehold improvements are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the lesser of the length of the lease, without consideration of option renewal periods and the estimated useful life of the assets, up to a maximum of five years. All other property and equipment are depreciated using the declining balance method as follows: Furniture and fixtures20%Computer hardware and software30%Equipment and vehicles30%We recognize a liability for the fair value of a required asset retirement obligation, or ARO, when such obligation is incurred. Our AROs are primarily associated with leasehold improvements which, at the end of a lease, we are contractually obligated to remove in order to comply with the lease agreement. At the inception of a lease with such conditions, we record an ARO liability and a corresponding capital asset in an amount equal to the estimated fair value of the obligation. The liability is 33Table of Contentsestimated based on a number of assumptions requiring management's judgment, including store closing costs, cost inflation rates and discount rates, and is accreted to its projected future value over time. The capitalized asset is depreciated using the convention for depreciation of leasehold improvement assets. Upon satisfaction of the ARO conditions, any difference between the recorded ARO liability and the actual retirement costs incurred is recognized as an operating gain or loss in the consolidated statements of operations.We recognize a liability for a cost associated with a lease exit activity when such obligation is incurred. A lease exit activity is measured initially at its fair value in the period in which the liability is incurred. We estimate fair value at the cease-use date of its operating leases as the remaining lease rentals, reduced by estimated sublease rentals that could be reasonably obtained for the property, even where we do not intend to enter into a sublease. Estimating the cost of certain lease exit costs involves subjective assumptions, including the time it would take to sublease the leased location and the related potential sublease income. The estimated accruals for these costs could be significantly affected if future experience differs from that used in the initial estimate. Lease exit costs are included in provision for impairment and lease exit costs.Long-Lived Assets. Long-lived assets, including intangible assets with finite useful lives, held for use are evaluated for impairment when the occurrence of events or changes in circumstances indicates that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable as measured by comparing their net book value to the estimated future cash flows generated by their use and eventual disposition. Impaired assets are recorded at fair value, determined principally by the estimated future cash flows expected from their use and eventual disposition. Reductions in asset values resulting from impairment valuations are recognized in income in the period that the impairment is determined. Long-lived assets, including intangible assets with finite useful lives, held for sale are reported at the lower of the carrying value of the asset and fair value less cost to sell. Any write-downs to reflect fair value less selling cost is recognized in income when the asset is classified as held for sale. Gains or losses on assets held for sale and asset dispositions are included in provision for impairment and lease exit costs.Income Taxes. We follow the liability method with respect to accounting for income taxes. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates that are expected to be in effect when these differences are anticipated to reverse. Deferred income tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance, if based on the weight of available positive and negative evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.The recognition of a deferred income tax asset is based upon several assumptions and management forecasts, including current and proposed tax legislation, current and anticipated taxable income, utilization of previously unrealized non-operating loss carry forwards and regulatory reviews of tax filings. Given the judgments and estimates required and the sensitivity of the results to the significant assumptions used, we believe the accounting estimates used in relation to the recognition of deferred income tax assets are subject to measurement uncertainty and are susceptible to a material change if the underlying assumptions change.For financial reporting purposes, we generally provide taxes at the rate applicable for the appropriate tax jurisdiction. Because our present intention is to reinvest the unremitted earnings in our foreign operations, we do not provide U.S. income taxes on unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries. Management periodically assesses the need to utilize these unremitted earnings to finance our foreign operations. This assessment is based on cash flow projections that are the result of estimates of future production, fiscal requirements by tax jurisdiction of our operations and operational and fiscal objectives by tax jurisdiction for our operations. Such estimates are inherently imprecise since many assumptions utilized in the cash flow projections are subject to revision in the future.We file income tax returns in the United States, Canada and various foreign and state jurisdictions. The 2011 to 2013 tax years remain subject to examination by the U.S. federal and state tax authorities. The 2008 tax year is still open for certain state tax authorities. The 2008 to 2013 tax years remain subject to examination by tax authorities in certain foreign jurisdictions. Our policy is to recognize interest expense and penalties related to income tax matters as a selling, general and administrative expense. At February 2, 2014, we do not have any significant accruals for interest related to unrecognized tax benefits or tax penalties. Our intercompany transfer pricing policies are currently subject to audits by various foreign tax jurisdictions. Although we believe that our intercompany transfer pricing policies and tax positions are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits or potential tax disputes may be materially different from that which is reflected in our income tax provisions and accruals.Goodwill and Intangible Assets. Intangible assets are recorded at cost. Reacquired franchise rights are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives of 10 years. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair market value of identifiable net assets acquired and is not amortized. Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested for impairment annually or more frequently when an event or circumstance indicates that goodwill or indefinite 34Table of Contentsuseful live intangible assets might be impaired. We use our best estimates and judgment based on available evidence in conducting the impairment testing. When the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess of the carrying value over its fair market value.Stock-Based Compensation. We account for stock-based compensation using the fair value method. The fair value of awards granted is estimated at the date of grant and recognized as employee compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period with the offsetting credit to additional paid-in capital. Our calculation of stock-based compensation requires us to make a number of complex and subjective estimates and assumptions, including future forfeitures, stock price volatility, expected life of the options and related tax effects. The estimation of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment, and to the extent actual results differ from our estimates, such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised. We consider several factors when estimating expected forfeitures, such as types of awards, size of option holder group and anticipated employee retention. Actual results may differ substantially from these estimates. Expected volatility of the stock is based on our review of companies we believe of similar growth and maturity and our peer group in the industry in which we do business because we do not have sufficient historical volatility data for our own stock. The expected term of options granted is derived from the output of the option valuation model and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding. In the future, as we gain historical data for volatility in our own stock and the actual term employees hold our options, expected volatility and expected term may change which could substantially change the grant-date fair value of future awards of stock options and, ultimately, the expense we record. For awards with service and/or performance conditions, the total amount of compensation expense to be recognized is based on the number of awards that are expected to vest and is adjusted to reflect those awards that do ultimately vest. For awards with performance conditions, we recognize the compensation expense over the requisite service period as determined by a range of probability weighted outcomes. For awards with market and or performance conditions, all compensation expense is recognized if it is probable that the underlying market or performance conditions will be fulfilled.ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKMarket risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates. Our market risk exposure is primarily a result of fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. We do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes.Foreign Currency Exchange Risk. We currently generate a significant portion of our net revenue in Canada. The reporting currency for our consolidated financial statements is the U.S. dollar. Historically, our operations were based largely in Canada. As of February 2, 2014, we operated 54 stores in Canada. As a result, we have been impacted by changes in exchange rates and may be impacted materially for the foreseeable future. As we recognize net revenue from sales in Canada in Canadian dollars, and the U.S. dollar has strengthened during fiscal 2013, it has had a negative impact on our Canadian operating results upon translation of those results into U.S. dollars for the purposes of consolidation. However, the loss in net revenue was partially offset by lower cost of sales and lower selling, general and administrative expenses that are generated in Canadian dollars. A 10% depreciation in the relative value of the Canadian dollar compared to the U.S. dollar would have resulted in lost income from operations of approximately $0.8 million in fiscal 2013 and approximately $5.5 million in fiscal 2012. To the extent the ratio between our net revenue generated in Canadian dollars increases as compared to our expenses generated in Canadian dollars, we expect that our results of operations will be further impacted by changes in exchange rates. A portion of our net revenue is generated in Australia. A 10% depreciation in the relative value of the Australian dollar compared to the U.S. dollar would have resulted in lost income from operations of approximately $0.3 million in fiscal 2013 and approximately $0.9 million in fiscal 2012. We do not currently hedge foreign currency fluctuations. However, in the future, in an effort to mitigate losses associated with these risks, we may at times enter into derivative financial instruments, although we have not historically done so. We do not, and do not intend to, engage in the practice of trading derivative securities for profit.Interest Rate Risk. In November 2013, we entered into unsecured demand revolving credit facilities with HSBC Bank Canada and Bank of America, N.A., Canada Branch. The revolving credit facilities provide us with available borrowings in amount up to $15.0 million total. Because our revolving credit facilities bear interest at a variable rate, we will be exposed to market risks relating to changes in interest rates, if we have a meaningful outstanding balance. As of February 2, 2014 we had no outstanding balances under our revolving facilities. We currently do not engage in any interest rate hedging activity and currently have no intention to do so in the foreseeable future. However, in the future, if we have a meaningful outstanding balance under our revolving facility, in an effort to mitigate losses associated with these risks, we may at times enter into derivative financial instruments, although we have not historically done so. These may take the form of forward contracts, option contracts, or interest rate swaps. We do not, and do not intend to, engage in the practice of trading derivative securities for profit. 35Table of ContentsInflationInflationary factors such as increases in the cost of our product and overhead costs may adversely affect our operating results. Although we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations to date, a high rate of inflation in the future may have an adverse effect on our ability to maintain current levels of gross margin and selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenue if the selling prices of our products do not increase with these increased costs.36Table of Contents",2023-12-30 21:53:25.187237

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThis discussion summarizes our consolidated operating results, financial condition and liquidity during the three-year period ending February 1, 2015. Our fiscal year ends on the Sunday closest to January 31 of the following year, typically resulting in a 52 week year, but occasionally giving rise to an additional week, resulting in a 53 week year. Fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013 were 52 week years whereas fiscal 2012 was a 53 week year. Net revenue numbers for fiscal 2012 include results from the 53rd week; however, total comparable sales and comparable stores sales calculations exclude the 53rd week. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements based on current expectations that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions, such as our plans, objectives, expectations and intentions set forth in the ""Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements."" Our actual results and the timing of events may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth in the ""Item 1A. Risk Factors"" section and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.OverviewFiscal 2014 was a year in which we continued to make investments we believe will help us to drive growth and expand our business. We have strengthened the foundation of our business through continued investments in product quality and supply chain and these investments will continue through fiscal 2015. Throughout fiscal 2014 we also focused on our product assortment, guest experience, and our go-to-market process for our products. Our improved product assortment helped to enhance our guest experience and contributed to the improved total comparative sales performance we saw in the second half of fiscal 2014. The opening of our new distribution center in Columbus, Ohio in fiscal 2014 has also helped improve guest experience through a reduction in our average transit times for online orders and will also benefit retail distribution to our corporate owned stores in the United States.We opened 48 net new corporate-owned stores in fiscal 2014, of which 40 were in the United States. In addition to our plans for further new store openings in the United States, we are focused on accelerating our international expansion. During fiscal 2014 we opened corporate-owned stores for the first time in the United Kingdom and Singapore and opened showrooms for the first time in China. We will continue to utilize a community-based approach to building brand awareness and guest loyalty in new countries but will look to do so over a shorter period of time than previously, so that we can accelerate our international growth.We see potential for further expansion for our men’s category and our ivivva athletica brand. In the men's category we expanded both in-store and online product assortment and we opened our first standalone men’s store in Soho, New York. For ivivva, we opened 10 new stores during fiscal 2014 and will continue to invest in this brand and open further stores through fiscal 2015.In fiscal 2015, we expect to substantially complete this foundational work and accelerate our investments in innovation to drive sustainable global growth.Financial Highlights•Our net revenue increased from $1.6 billion in fiscal 2013 to $1.8 billion in fiscal 2014, representing an annual growth rate of 13%. Our increase in net revenue from fiscal 2013 to fiscal 2014 resulted from the addition of 48 net new corporate-owned stores and increased direct to consumer net revenue. •Total comparable sales, which includes comparable store sales and direct to consumer, increased 1% in fiscal 2014 and increased by 3% on a constant dollar basis. •Our direct to consumer segment is an increasingly substantial part of our growth strategy, and now represents 17.9% of our net revenue compared to 16.5% in fiscal 2013 and 14.4% in fiscal 2012. Direct to consumer net revenue increased 24% on a constant dollar basis primarily as the result of increased traffic on our e-commerce websites.•Corporate-owned stores accounted for 75.0% of total net revenue in fiscal 2014, 77.3% of total net revenue in fiscal 2013 and 79.6% of total net revenue in fiscal 2012. Comparable store sales decreased by 1% on a constant dollar basis for fiscal 2014 primarily as the result of lower conversion rates and lower units purchased per transaction.19Table of Contents•Gross profit for fiscal 2014 increased by 9% to $914.2 million, from $840.1 million in fiscal 2013. As a percentage of net revenue, gross profit decreased to 50.9% compared to 52.8% in fiscal 2013. The decrease in the gross margin percentage was primarily due to product mix, increased product costs, and increased air freight usage.•Income from operations for fiscal 2014 decreased by 4% to $376.0 million, from $391.4 million in fiscal 2013. As a percentage of net revenue, income from operations decreased to 20.9% compared to 24.6% of net revenue in fiscal 2013. The decrease in income from operations was a result of an increase in selling, general and administration expenses, relative to the increase in net revenue, partially offset by an increase in gross margin.•Tax expense for fiscal 2014 increased by 23% to $144.1 million, from $117.6 million in fiscal 2013. Fiscal 2014 includes a tax expense of $33.7 million related to the repatriation of foreign earnings that will be used to fund the share buyback program. The tax rate excluding the $33.7 million tax expense on the repatriation of foreign earnings would have been 28.8%, compared to 29.6% in fiscal 2013. The tax rate for fiscal 2014, including the tax expense on the repatriation of foreign earnings, was 37.6%.•Diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2014 were $1.66. compared to $1.91 in fiscal 2013. Excluding the tax expense of $33.7 million on the repatriated foreign earnings, diluted earnings per share were $1.89 for fiscal 2014.Refer to the non-GAAP reconciliation tables contained in the ""Results of Operations"" section of this ""Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations"" for reconciliations of constant dollar total comparable sales, constant dollar comparable store sales, constant dollar changes in direct to consumer net revenue, the fiscal 2014 tax rate excluding the tax expense on the repatriation of foreign earnings, and diluted earnings per share excluding the tax expense on the repatriation of foreign earnings to measures calculated in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (""GAAP"").GeneralNet revenue is comprised of corporate-owned store net revenue, direct to consumer sales through www.lululemon.com, www.ivivva.com and other country and region specific websites, and other net revenue, which includes outlet sales, showroom sales, sales to wholesale accounts, warehouse sales, and sales from temporary locations.Cost of goods sold includes the cost of purchased merchandise, including in-bound freight, duty and nonrefundable taxes incurred in delivering the goods to our distribution centers. It also includes occupancy costs and depreciation expense for our corporate-owned store locations, all costs incurred in operating our distribution centers and production, design and merchandise departments, hemming, and shrink and valuation reserves. The primary drivers of the costs of individual goods are the costs of raw materials and labor in the countries where we source our merchandise.Selling, general and administrative expenses consist of all operating costs not otherwise included in cost of goods sold. We anticipate that our selling, general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars due to anticipated continued growth of our corporate support staff and store-level employees.Provision for income taxes depends on the statutory tax rates in the countries where we sell our products. We anticipate that in the future we may start to sell our products directly to some customers located in countries that we have not yet operated in, in which case we would become subject to taxation based on the foreign statutory rates in the countries where these sales take place and our effective tax rate could fluctuate accordingly.20Table of ContentsResults of OperationsThe following tables summarize key components of our results of operations for the periods indicated, both in dollars and as a percentage of net revenue: Fiscal Year Ended February 1, 2015 February 2, 2014 February 3, 2013 (In thousands)Consolidated statements of operations: Net revenue $1,797,213 $1,591,188 $1,370,358Cost of goods sold 883,033 751,112 607,532Gross profit 914,180 840,076 762,826Selling, general and administrative expenses 538,147 448,718 386,387Income from operations 376,033 391,358 376,439Other income (expense), net 7,102 5,768 4,957Income before provision for income taxes 383,135 397,126 381,396Provision for income taxes 144,102 117,579 109,965Net income 239,033 279,547 271,431Net income attributable to non-controlling interest — — 875Net income attributable to lululemon athletica inc. $239,033 $279,547 $270,556 Fiscal Year Ended February 1, 2015 February 2, 2014 February 3, 2013 (% of net revenue)Net revenue 100.0 100.0 100.0Cost of goods sold 49.1 47.2 44.3Gross profit 50.9 52.8 55.7Selling, general and administrative expenses 30.0 28.2 28.2Income from operations 20.9 24.6 27.5Other income (expense), net 0.4 0.4 0.3Income before provision for income taxes 21.3 25.0 27.8Provision for income taxes 8.0 7.4 8.0Net income 13.3 17.6 19.8Net income attributable to non-controlling interest — — 0.1Net income attributable to lululemon athletica inc. 13.3 17.6 19.7Comparison of Fiscal 2014 to Fiscal 2013 Net RevenueNet revenue increased $206.0 million, or 13%, to $1.797 billion in fiscal 2014 from $1.591 billion in fiscal 2013. Assuming the average exchange rates in fiscal 2014 remained constant with the average exchange rates in fiscal 2013, our net revenue would have increased $241.7 million, or 15%.The net revenue increase was driven by sales from new stores and the growth of our direct to consumer segment. Total comparable sales, which includes comparable store sales and direct to consumer, increased 1% in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013. Excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations, total comparable sales would have increased by 3%.21Table of ContentsOur net revenue on a segment basis for fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013 is summarized below. Net revenue is expressed in dollar amounts. The percentages are presented as a percentage of total net revenue. Fiscal Year Ended February 1, 2015 and February 2, 2014 2014 2013 2014 2013 (In thousands) (Percentages)Corporate-owned stores $1,348,225 $1,228,999 75.0 77.3Direct to consumer 321,180 263,083 17.9 16.5Other 127,808 99,106 7.1 6.2Net revenue $1,797,213 $1,591,188 100.0 100.0Corporate-Owned Stores. Net revenue from our corporate-owned stores segment increased $119.2 million, or 10%, to $1.348 billion in fiscal 2014 from $1.229 billion in fiscal 2013. Net revenue from corporate-owned stores we opened during fiscal 2014, and during fiscal 2013 prior to sales from such stores becoming part of our comparable stores base, contributed $162.0 million of the increase. Net new store openings in fiscal 2014 included 40 stores in the United States, including eight ivivva branded stores, three stores in Canada, including two ivivva branded stores, one store in Australia, one store in New Zealand, two stores in the United Kingdom and one store in Singapore. The increase in net revenue from our corporate-owned stores segment was partially offset by a comparable store sales decrease of 3% in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 which resulted in a $42.8 million decrease to net revenue, including the effect of foreign currency fluctuations. Excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations, comparable store sales would have decreased 1%, or $19.1 million, in fiscal 2014. Comparable store sales have decreased, primarily as the result of lower conversion rates and lower units purchased per transaction.Direct to Consumer. Net revenue from our direct to consumer segment increased $58.1 million, or 22%, to $321.2 million in fiscal 2014 from $263.1 million in fiscal 2013. Excluding the effect of foreign exchange fluctuations, direct to consumer net revenue would have increased 24%. The increase in net revenue from our direct to consumer segment was a result of increasing traffic on our e-commerce websites.Other. Net revenue from our other segment increased $28.7 million, or 29%, to $127.8 million in fiscal 2014 from $99.1 million in fiscal 2013. The increase in net revenue from our other segment was primarily due to increased sales from our outlets, showrooms, and temporary locations. We continue to employ our other segment strategy to increase interest in our product in markets where we may not have corporate-owned stores.Gross ProfitGross profit increased $74.1 million, or 9%, to $914.2 million in fiscal 2014 from $840.1 million in fiscal 2013. Increased net revenue resulted in an increased gross profit. A $17.5 million inventory provision related to the pull-back of black Luon pants was recorded in cost of sales during fiscal 2013.The increase in gross profit was partially offset by increased costs related to our production, design, distribution and merchandising departments, as well as increases in fixed costs, such as occupancy costs and depreciation. Gross profit, as a percentage of net revenue, or gross margin, decreased 190 basis points, to 50.9% in fiscal 2014 from 52.8% in fiscal 2013. The decrease in gross margin resulted primarily from:•a decrease of 210 basis points due to product mix, increased product costs, and increased air freight costs;•an increase in expenses related to our product and supply chain departments, relative to the increase in net revenue, of 70 basis points; •an increase in fixed costs, such as occupancy costs and depreciation, relative to the increase in net revenue, of 40 basis points; and•an unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates on product costs which contributed to a decrease in gross margin of 40 basis points.The decrease in gross margin was partially offset by a decrease in provision for inventories, charged to cost of sales, of 110 basis points related to the pull-back of black Luon pants which was recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2013. A decrease in markdowns of 60 basis points driven by high sell-through of seasonal items also partially offset the decrease in gross margin.22Table of ContentsSelling, General and Administrative ExpensesSelling, general and administrative expenses increased $89.4 million, or 20%, to $538.1 million in fiscal 2014 from $448.7 million in fiscal 2013. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was principally comprised of:•an increase in employee costs of $40.2 million as there were increases in hourly wages and a growth in labor hours associated with new corporate-owned stores, outlets, showrooms and other;•an increase in variable store costs of $5.7 million from new corporate-owned stores, outlets, showrooms and other;•an increase in variable costs such as distribution costs, credit card fees and packaging related to our direct to consumer segment of $6.0 million as a result of increased sales volume;•an increase in administrative costs related to our direct to consumer segment of $4.4 million associated with the growth in this channel and increased head count to support it;•an increase in head office employee costs of $5.7 million from increased head count in order to position us for long-term growth, partially offset by decreased stock-based compensation;•an increase in other head office costs of $5.2 million as a result of the overall growth of our business and investment in strategic initiatives and projects;•an increase in other costs, including occupancy costs not included in cost of goods sold, of $11.4 million; and•a decrease in net foreign exchange gains of $10.8 million.As a percentage of net revenue, selling, general and administrative expenses increased 180 basis points, to 30.0% in fiscal 2014 from 28.2% in fiscal 2013.We expect selling, general and administrative expenses to increase throughout fiscal 2015 as we add administrative and sales personnel and increase our infrastructure to support the growth in our store base.Income from OperationsIncome from operations decreased $15.3 million, or 4%, to $376.0 million in fiscal 2014 from $391.4 million in fiscal 2013. The decrease was a result of increased selling, general and administrative costs of $89.4 million, partially offset by increased gross profit of $74.1 million. The increase in selling, general and administrative costs was primarily driven by the increase in our business.On a segment basis, we determine income from operations without taking into account our general corporate expenses. We have reviewed our general corporate expenses and determined some costs previously classified as general corporate are direct segment expenses. Accordingly, all prior year comparable information has been reclassified to conform to the current year classification.Income from operations before general corporate expenses for fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013 is summarized below and is expressed in dollar amounts. The percentages are presented as a percentage of net revenue of the respective operating segments. Fiscal Year Ended February 1, 2015 and February 2, 2014 2014 2013 2014 2013 (In thousands) (Percentages)Corporate-owned stores $356,589 $372,267 26.4 30.3Direct to consumer 132,877 109,999 41.4 41.8Other 9,499 13,994 7.4 14.1Income from operations before general corporate expense 498,965 496,260 General corporate expense 122,932 104,902 Income from operations $376,033 $391,358 Corporate-Owned Stores. Income from operations from our corporate-owned stores segment decreased $15.7 million, or 4%, to $356.6 million for fiscal 2014 from $372.3 million for fiscal 2013 primarily due to an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses related to employee costs as well as operating expenses associated with new stores, partially offset by an increase of $31.2 million in gross profit from increased sales. Income from operations as a percentage of corporate-owned stores net revenue decreased by 390 basis points primarily due to higher selling, general and administrative expenses as a 23Table of Contentspercentage of net revenue as well as lower gross margin resulting from product mix, increased product costs, and increased air freight costs.Direct to Consumer. Income from operations from our direct to consumer segment increased $22.9 million, or 21%, to $132.9 million in fiscal 2014 from $110.0 million in fiscal 2013. The increase was primarily the result of increased gross profit of $33.1 million primarily due to increased net revenue resulting from increased traffic, partially offset by increased selling, general and administrative expenses related to our long-term strategy for developing this channel. Income from operations as a percentage of direct to consumer net revenue decreased to 41.4% in fiscal 2014 from 41.8% in fiscal 2013.Other. Income from operations from our other segment decreased $4.5 million, or 32%, to $9.5 million in fiscal 2014 from $14.0 million in fiscal 2013. Income from operations as a percentage of other net revenue decreased by 670 basis points primarily due to an increased number of showrooms in new international markets which have a higher cost structure than North America. We continue to employ our other segment strategy to increase interest in our product in markets we have not otherwise entered with corporate-owned stores.General Corporate Expense. General corporate expense increased $18.0 million, or 17%, to $122.9 million in fiscal 2014 from $104.9 million in fiscal 2013. This increase was primarily due to a $10.8 million decrease in net foreign exchange gains, primarily from our Canadian operating entity. An increase in expenses related to our head office growth of $7.2 million, which was largely related to additional costs incurred to support the growth of our business, including increased professional fees related to investment in strategic initiatives and projects. General corporate expenses are expected to continue to increase in future years as we grow our overall business and require increased efforts at our head office to support our corporate-owned stores, direct to consumer and other segments.Other Income (Expense), NetOther income (expense), net increased $1.3 million, to $7.1 million in fiscal 2014 from $5.8 million in fiscal 2013. The increase was primarily the result of increased interest earned on cash and cash equivalents.Provision for Income TaxesProvision for income taxes increased $26.5 million, or 23%, to $144.1 million in fiscal 2014 from $117.6 million in fiscal 2013. In fiscal 2014, our effective tax rate was 37.6% compared to 29.6% in fiscal 2013. The increase in our effective tax rate was a result of a tax expense of $33.7 million recorded during fiscal 2014 to provide for U.S. income and applicable foreign withholding taxes on dividends of $473.7 million which were distributed during fiscal 2014 from foreign subsidiaries to the U.S. parent entity to fund the share repurchase program.Net IncomeNet income decreased $40.5 million, or 15%, to $239.0 million in fiscal 2014 from $279.5 million in fiscal 2013. The decrease in net income in fiscal 2014 was primarily due to an increase of $89.4 million in selling, general and administrative expenses, and an increase of $26.5 million in provision for income taxes, partially offset by a $1.3 million increase in other income (expense), and a $74.1 million increase in gross profit resulting from new stores and the growth of our direct to consumer segment.Comparison of Fiscal 2013 to Fiscal 2012Net RevenueNet revenue increased $220.8 million, or 16%, to $1.591 billion in fiscal 2013 from $1.370 billion in fiscal 2012. Assuming the average exchange rates in fiscal 2013 remained constant with the average exchange rates in fiscal 2012, our net revenue would have increased $247.0 million, or 18%. Total comparable sales, including comparable stores and direct to consumer, and excluding the fifty-third week’s sales of fiscal 2012, increased 7% in fiscal 2013, or 9% excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations.The net revenue increase was driven by sales from new stores, the growth of our direct to consumer segment, and increased sales at locations in our comparable stores base. The constant dollar increase in comparable store sales was driven primarily by the strength of our existing product lines, successful introduction of new products and increasing recognition of the lululemon athletica brand name, especially at our U.S. stores, that drove higher transactions per store in the United States.24Table of ContentsOur net revenue on a segment basis for fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012 are expressed in dollar amounts as well as relevant percentages, presented as a percentage of total net revenue below.

The following contributed to the increase in net revenue from our corporate-owned stores segment: •Net revenue from corporate-owned stores we opened during fiscal 2013, and during fiscal 2012 prior to sales from such stores becoming part of our comparable stores base, contributed $138.0 million of the increase. New store openings in fiscal 2013 included three stores in Canada, including one ivivva branded store, 36 stores in the United States, including three ivivva branded stores, two stores in Australia, and two stores in New Zealand; and •Comparable store sales increase of 2% in fiscal 2013 resulted in a $19.5 million increase to net revenue, including the effect of foreign currency fluctuations. Excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations, comparable store sales increased 4%, or $37.3 million, in fiscal 2013.The increase in net revenue was partially offset by $18.7 million of net revenue from the 53rd week of fiscal 2012, which was excluded in the calculation of comparable store sales.Direct to Consumer. Net revenue from our direct to consumer segment increased $65.8 million, or 33%, to $263.1 million in fiscal 2013 from $197.3 million in fiscal 2012, including $4.2 million of net revenue from the 53rd week of fiscal 2012. Excluding the net revenue from the 53rd week of fiscal 2012, net revenue from our direct to consumer segment increased 36%; excluding the effect of foreign exchange fluctuations, direct to consumer net revenue would have increased 38%. The increase in net revenue from our direct to consumer segment was a result of increasing traffic on our e-commerce websites.Other. Net revenue from our other segment increased $16.2 million, or 20%, to $99.1 million in fiscal 2013 from $82.9 million in fiscal 2012, including $3.3 million of net revenue from the 53rd week of fiscal 2012. The increase in net revenue from our other segment was primarily due to increased sales from our outlets and showrooms sales channels. We continue to employ our other segment strategy to increase interest in our product in markets where we may not have corporate-owned stores.Gross Profit Gross profit increased $77.2 million, or 10%, to $840.1 million in fiscal 2013 from $762.8 million in fiscal 2012. Increased net revenue in all of our operating segments resulted in an increased gross profit. A $17.5 million charge related to the pull-back of black Luon pants was recorded in cost of sales during fiscal 2013.The increase in gross profit was partially offset by increases in fixed costs, such as occupancy costs and depreciation, as well as increased costs related to our design, merchandising, and production departments.Gross profit, as a percentage of net revenue, or gross margin, decreased 290 basis points, to 52.8% in fiscal 2013 from 55.7% in fiscal 2012. The decrease in gross margin resulted primarily from: •a decrease in product margin of 200 basis points due to a lower sales mix of higher margin core items related to the pull-back of black Luon pants, along with higher markdowns and an increase in provision for inventories charged to cost of sales; and•a non-recurring charge of 110 basis points related to the pull-back of black Luon pants in the first quarter of fiscal 2013.The decrease in gross margin was partially offset by a decrease in expenses related to our product and supply chain departments, relative to the increase in net revenue, and by leverage on fixed costs, such as depreciation and occupancy costs, which together contributed to an increase in gross margin of 20 basis points.25Table of ContentsSelling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $62.3 million, or 16%, to $448.7 million in fiscal 2013 from $386.4 million in fiscal 2012. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was principally comprised of: •an increase in employee costs of $25.3 million as we experience growth in labor hours associated with new and existing corporate-owned stores, outlets, showrooms and other, as well as an increase in wages as we invest in our employees;•an increase in variable store costs of $9.5 million from new and existing corporate-owned stores, outlets, showrooms and other;•an increase in variable costs such as distribution costs, credit card fees and packaging related to our direct to consumer segment of $7.3 million as a result of increased sales volume;•an increase in administrative costs related to our direct to consumer segment of $5.3 million associated with the growth in this channel and increased head count to support it;•an increase in head office employee costs of $5.7 million from increased head count in order to position us for long-term growth, partially offset by decreased management incentive-based compensation and stock-based compensation;•an increase in other head office costs of $17.5 million as a result of the overall growth of our business and investment in strategic initiatives and projects; and•an increase in other costs, including occupancy costs and depreciation not included in cost of goods sold, of $9.6 million as a result of the expansion of our business and in order to position us for long-term growth.The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was partially offset by a $17.9 million increase in net foreign exchange gains which were primarily from our Canadian operating entity.As a percentage of net revenue, selling, general and administrative expenses remained unchanged at 28.2% in both fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012. Income from Operations Income from operations increased $14.9 million, or 4%, to $391.4 million in fiscal 2013 from $376.4 million in fiscal 2012. The increase was a result of increased gross profit of $77.2 million, partially offset by increased selling, general and administrative costs of $62.3 million. The increase in selling, general and administrative costs was primarily driven by the increase in our business, as seen in our net revenue increases. On a segment basis, we determine income from operations without taking into account our general corporate expenses. We have reviewed our general corporate expenses and determined some costs previously classified as general corporate are direct segment expenses. Accordingly, all prior year comparable information has been reclassified to conform to the current year classification.Income from operations before general corporate expenses for fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012 are expressed in dollar amounts as well as percentages, presented as a percentage of net revenue of their respective operating segments below. Fiscal Year Ended February 2, 2014 and February 3, 2013 2013 2012 2013 2012 (In thousands) (Percentages)Corporate-owned stores $372,267 $373,607 30.3 34.3Direct to consumer 109,999 85,128 41.8 43.2Other 13,994 19,787 14.1 23.9Income from operations before general corporate expense 496,260 478,522 General corporate expense 104,902 102,083 Income from operations $391,358 $376,439 Corporate-Owned Stores. Income from operations from our corporate-owned stores segment decreased $1.3 million, or less than 1%, to $372.3 million for fiscal 2013 from $373.6 million for fiscal 2012 primarily due to an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses related to employee costs as well as operating expenses associated with new stores and a $17.5 million charge related to the pull-back of black Luon pants, which was partially offset by an increase of $38.3 million in gross profit. Income from operations as a percentage of corporate-owned stores net revenue decreased by 400 basis points 26Table of Contentsprimarily from a decrease in gross margin due to a lower mix of higher margin core items related to the pull-back of black Luon pants.Direct to Consumer. Income from operations from our direct to consumer segment increased $24.9 million, or 29%, to $110.0 million in fiscal 2013 from $85.1 million in fiscal 2012 due to increased sales through our e-commerce websites, with gross profit increasing $36.3 million over fiscal 2012. Income from operations as a percentage of direct to consumer net revenue decreased by 140 basis points in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012.Other. Income from operations from our other segment decreased $5.8 million, or 29%, to $14.0 million in fiscal 2013 from $19.8 million in fiscal 2012. We continue to employ our other segment strategy to increase interest in our product in markets we have not otherwise entered with corporate-owned stores.General Corporate Expense. General corporate expenses increased $2.8 million, or 3%, to $104.9 million in fiscal 2013 from $102.1 million in fiscal 2012. This increase was primarily due to an increase in expenses related to our head office growth of $27.3 million, which was largely related to the growth of our information technology and human resources departments as well as the overall growth of our business, and increased professional fees related to investment in strategic initiatives and projects. Increased depreciation and amortization expense of $3.3 million also contributed to the increase in general corporate expense. The increase in general corporate expense was partially offset by an increase of $17.9 million in net foreign exchange gains which were primarily from our Canadian operating entity as well as decreased management incentive-based compensation of $5.0 million and decreased stock-based compensation expense of $4.9 million. Other Income (Expense), Net Other income (expense), net increased $0.8 million, to $5.8 million in fiscal 2013 from $5.0 million in fiscal 2012. The increase was primarily a result of increased interest income earned in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 on our increased cash balances. Provision for Income Taxes Provision for income taxes increased $7.6 million, or 7%, to $117.6 million in fiscal 2013 from $110.0 million in fiscal 2012. In fiscal 2013, our effective tax rate was 29.6% compared to 28.8% in fiscal 2012.Net Income Net income increased $9.0 million, or 3%, to $279.5 million in fiscal 2013 from $270.6 million in fiscal 2012. The increase in net income in fiscal 2013 was primarily due to a $77.2 million increase in gross profit resulting from sales growth at existing and additional corporate-owned stores opened during fiscal 2013 and increasing traffic on our e-commerce websites and the addition of regional websites and a $0.8 million increase in other income (expense), net, partially offset by an increase of $62.3 million in selling, general and administrative expenses, and an increase of $7.6 million in provision for income taxes.Comparable SalesWe separately track comparable store sales, which reflect net revenue at corporate-owned stores that have been open for at least 12 months. Therefore, net revenue from a store is included in comparable store sales beginning with the first month for which the store has a full month of comparable prior year sales. Non-comparable store sales include sales from new stores that have not been open or otherwise not operated by us for 12 months or from stores which have been significantly remodeled or relocated. Also included in non-comparable stores sales are sales from direct to consumer sales, outlets, wholesale, warehouse sales, showrooms, temporary locations, and sales from corporate-owned stores which we have closed. The 53rd week of fiscal 2012 is excluded from the calculation of comparable store sales. We began to report total comparable sales in fiscal 2013, which combines comparable store sales and direct to consumer sales, excluding the 53rd week of sales from fiscal 2012. Our direct to consumer segment represents a growing portion of our net revenue as the shopping behavior of our guests evolves. Our approach to our guests supports this as it involves country and region specific websites, mobile/tablet devices in stores, social networks, and product notification emails. We therefore believe that reporting total comparable sales with comparable store sales and direct to consumer sales combined provides a more relevant metric.By measuring the change in year-over-year net revenue in stores that have been open for 12 months or more as well as direct to consumer sales, total comparable sales allows us to evaluate our performance eliminating the impact of newly opened stores. Various factors affect comparable sales, including:•the location of new stores relative to existing stores;27Table of Contents•consumer preferences, buying trends and overall economic trends;•our ability to anticipate and respond effectively to customer preferences for technical athletic apparel;•competition;•changes in our merchandise mix;•pricing;•the timing of our releases of new merchandise and promotional events;•the effectiveness of our grassroots marketing efforts;•the level of customer service that we provide in our stores and on our websites;•our ability to source and distribute products efficiently; and•the number of stores we open, close (including for temporary renovations) and expand in any period.Opening new stores is an important part of our growth strategy. Accordingly, total comparable sales has limited utility for assessing the success of our growth strategy insofar as comparable sales do not reflect the performance of stores open less than 12 months.Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresNet revenue changes in constant dollars, total comparable sales in constant dollars, comparable store sales in constant dollars, changes in direct to consumer net revenue in constant dollars, the tax rate excluding the tax expense on the repatriation of foreign earnings, and diluted earnings per share excluding the tax expense on the repatriation of foreign earnings are non-GAAP performance measures. We provide constant dollar changes in net revenue, total comparable sales, comparable store sales, and changes in direct to consumer net revenue because we use these measures to understand the underlying growth rate of net revenue excluding the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates, which are not under management’s control. We believe that disclosing these measures on a constant dollar basis is useful to investors because it enables them to better understand the level of growth of our business.We disclose the tax rate and diluted earnings per share excluding the tax expense on repatriated foreign earnings because of their comparability to our historical information as well as our diluted earnings per share guidance, which we believe is useful to investors.The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures follows, which includes more detail on the GAAP financial measure that is most directly comparable to each non-GAAP financial measure, and the related reconciliations between these financial measures.The below performance measures show the dollar and percentage change compared to the corresponding period in the prior year.Constant dollar changes in net revenue Fiscal Year Ended February 1, 2015 Fiscal Year Ended February 2, 2014 (In thousands) (Percentage) (In thousands) (Percentage)Net revenue increase $206,024 13% $220,830 16%Adjustments due to foreign exchange rate changes 35,656 2% 26,153 2%Net revenue increase in constant dollars $241,680 15% $246,983 18%28Table of ContentsConstant dollar total comparable sales Fiscal Year Ended February 1, 2015 Fiscal Year Ended February 2, 2014Total comparable sales 1% 7%Adjustments due to foreign exchange rate changes 2% 2%Total comparable sales in constant dollars 3% 9%Constant dollar comparable store sales Fiscal Year Ended February 1, 2015 Fiscal Year Ended February 2, 2014 (In thousands) (Percentage) (In thousands) (Percentage)Comparable store sales $(42,801) (3)% $19,460 2%Adjustments due to foreign exchange rate changes 23,712 2 % 17,874 2%Comparable store sales in constant dollars $(19,089) (1)% $37,334 4%Constant dollar changes in direct to consumer net revenue Fiscal Year Ended February 1, 2015 Fiscal Year Ended February 2, 2014 (Percentage)Change in direct to consumer net revenue 22% 36%Adjustments due to foreign exchange rate changes 2% 2%Change in direct to consumer net revenue in constant dollars 24% 38%Tax rate, excluding the tax expense on repatriated foreign earnings Fiscal Year Ended February 1, 2015 Fiscal Year Ended February 2, 2014Tax rate 37.6 % 29.6%Tax expense on repatriated foreign earnings (8.8)% —%Tax rate, excluding the tax expense on repatriated foreign earnings 28.8 % 29.6%Diluted earnings per share, excluding the tax expense on repatriated foreign earnings Fiscal Year Ended February 1, 2015 Fiscal Year Ended February 2, 2014Diluted earnings per share $1.66 $1.91Tax expense on repatriated foreign earnings 0.23 —Diluted earnings per share, excluding the tax expense on repatriated foreign earnings $1.89 $1.91Liquidity and Capital ResourcesOur primary sources of liquidity are our current balances of cash and cash equivalents, cash flows from operations and borrowings available under our revolving credit facility. Our primary cash needs are capital expenditures for opening new stores and remodeling existing stores, making information technology system enhancements and funding working capital requirements. Cash and cash equivalents in excess of our needs are held in interest bearing accounts with financial institutions.As of February 1, 2015, our working capital (excluding cash and cash equivalents) was $126.7 million and our cash and cash equivalents were $664.5 million.29Table of ContentsThe following table summarizes our net cash flows provided by and used in operating, investing and financing activities for the periods indicated: Fiscal Year Ended February 1, 2015 February 2, 2014 February 3, 2013 (In thousands)Total cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $314,449 $278,339 $280,113Investing activities (119,733) (106,408) (93,229)Financing activities (149,077) 8,907 (5,491)Effect of exchange rate changes (79,809) (72,368) (651)(Decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents $(34,170) $108,470 $180,742Operating ActivitiesOperating Activities consist primarily of net income adjusted for certain non-cash items, including depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense and the effect of changes in non-cash working capital items, principally accounts payable, inventories, prepaid expenses, income taxes payable, accrued compensation and related expenses, and deferred gift card revenue.In fiscal 2014, cash provided by operating activities increased $36.1 million, to $314.4 million compared to cash provided by operating activities of $278.3 million in fiscal 2013. The increase was primarily a result of decreased income taxes paid and an increase in accrued compensation and related benefits, partially offset by a decrease in net income. The net increase in items not affecting cash was primarily due to an increase in depreciation related to our increased number of stores.Investing ActivitiesInvesting Activities relate primarily to capital expenditures.Cash used in investing activities increased $13.3 million, to $119.7 million in fiscal 2014 from $106.4 million in fiscal 2013. Capital expenditures for our corporate-owned stores segment were $76.9 million in fiscal 2014 which included $38.1 million to open 49 corporate-owned stores and $60.2 million in fiscal 2013 which included $31.3 million to open 45 corporate-owned stores. The remaining capital expenditures for our corporate-owned stores segment in each period were for ongoing store refurbishment. Capital expenditures for our direct to consumer segment were $10.0 million and $6.0 million in fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013, respectively. Capital expenditures related to corporate activities and administration were $32.9 million and $40.2 million in fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013, respectively. The capital expenditures in each period for corporate activities and administration were for improvements at our head office and other corporate buildings as well as investments in information technology and business systems.Capital expenditures are expected to range between $130 million and $135 million in fiscal 2015.Financing ActivitiesFinancing Activities consist primarily of cash used to repurchase shares of our common stock, cash received on the exercise of stock options, excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation, taxes paid related to the net share settlement of equity awards, and cash paid to acquire the remaining non-controlling interest in Australia in fiscal 2012. Cash used by financing activities increased $158.0 million, to cash used of $149.1 million in fiscal 2014 from cash provided of $8.9 million in fiscal 2013. The primary cause of this increase is our stock repurchase program which began in the second quarter of fiscal 2014. During fiscal 2014 we repurchased 3.7 million shares for a total cost of $147.4 million.We believe that our cash and cash equivalent balances, cash generated from operations, and borrowings available to us under our revolving credit facility will be adequate to meet our liquidity needs and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months. Our cash from operations may be negatively impacted by a decrease in demand for our products as well as the other factors described in ""Item 1A. Risk Factors"". In addition, we may make discretionary capital improvements with respect to our stores, distribution facilities, headquarters, or other systems, which we would expect to fund through the use of cash, issuance of debt or equity securities or other external financing sources to the extent we were unable to fund such capital expenditures out of our cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from operations.30Table of ContentsRevolving Credit FacilityOn November 22, 2013, we entered into unsecured demand revolving credit facilities with HSBC Bank Canada and Bank of America, N.A., Canada Branch, which replaced our 2007 credit facility. The credit facilities provide us with available borrowings in a total amount of $15.0 million. Borrowings under the credit facilities must be repaid in full on demand and are available by way of U.S. or Canadian denominated advances, letters of credit or depository bills. Advances denominated in U.S. Dollars bear interest on the outstanding balance at a rate equal to U.S. LIBOR plus 100 basis points or the U.S. prime rate, at our option. Advances denominated in Canadian Dollars bear interest on the outstanding balance at a rate equal to the CDOR Rate plus 100 basis points or the Canadian prime rate, at our option. Borrowings drawn down under standby letters of credit bear a fee of 100 basis points and borrowings drawn down under commercial letters of credit bear the banks' standard pricing. We are also required to pay a quarterly commitment fee of 10 basis points on the unused portion of the facility. Our wholly-owned subsidiary, lululemon usa inc., has provided a guarantee to the bank counter-parties under the facilities. The revolving credit facilities are unsecured, with a negative pledge on assets subject to permitted encumbrances, and no financial covenants. These facilities were renewed for a one year period in November 2014. As of February 1, 2015, aside from letters of credit of $0.6 million, we had no other borrowings outstanding under these credit facilities.Contractual Obligations and CommitmentsLeases. We lease certain store and other retail locations, distribution centers, offices, and equipment under non-cancelable operating leases. Our leases generally have initial terms of between five and 10 years, and generally can be extended only in five-year increments, if at all. Our leases expire at various dates between one and 10 years, excluding extensions at our option. A substantial number of our leases include renewal options and certain of our leases include rent escalation clauses, rent holidays and leasehold rental incentives, none of which are reflected in the table below. Most of our leases for store premises also include contingent rental payments based on sales volume, the impact of which also are not reflected in the table below. Product purchase obligations. The amounts listed for product purchase obligations in the table below represent agreements (including open purchase orders) to purchase products in the ordinary course of business that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms. In some cases, prices are subject to change throughout the production process. The reported amounts exclude product purchase liabilities included in accounts payable and accrued inventory liabilities as of February 1, 2015.The following table summarizes our contractual arrangements as of February 1, 2015, and the timing and effect that such commitments are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods: Payments Due by Fiscal Year Total 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 Thereafter (In thousands)Operating leases (minimum rent) $395,483 $82,282 $81,697 $72,660 $57,190 $43,625 $58,029Product purchase obligations $189,723 $189,723 $— $— $— $— $—Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsWe enter into standby letters of credit to secure certain of our obligations, including leases, taxes and duties. As of February 1, 2015, letters of credit and letters of guarantee totaling $0.6 million have been issued.Other than our operating leases and these standby letters of credit, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, investments in special purpose entities or undisclosed borrowings or debt. In addition, we have not entered into any derivative contracts or synthetic leases.Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions. Predicting future events is inherently an imprecise activity and, as such, requires the use of judgment. Actual results may vary from estimates in amounts that may be material to the financial statements. An accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically, could materially impact our consolidated financial statements.31Table of ContentsWe believe that the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements:Revenue Recognition. Net revenue is recognized net of sales taxes, discounts, and an estimated allowance for sales returns. Sales to customers through corporate-owned stores and other physical locations are recognized at the point of sale, net of an estimated allowance for sales returns. Direct to consumer sales are recognized when goods are shipped and collection is reasonably assured, net of an estimated allowance for sales returns. Other net revenue includes outlet sales, showroom sales, sales to wholesale accounts, warehouse sales, and sales from temporary locations. Revenue is recognized when these sales occur and amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling are recognized at the time of shipment.Our estimated allowance for sales returns is a subjective critical estimate that has a direct impact on reported net revenue. This allowance is calculated based on a history of actual returns, estimated future returns and any significant future known or anticipated events. Consideration of these factors results in an estimated allowance for sales returns. Our standard terms for retail sales limit returns to approximately 14 days after the sale of the merchandise, however we accept returns after 14 days where the product fails to meet our guests' quality expectations. For our wholesale sales, we allow returns from our wholesale accounts if properly requested and approved. Employee discounts are classified as a reduction of net revenue.Revenue from our gift cards is recognized when tendered for payment, or upon redemption. Outstanding customer balances are included in ""Unredeemed gift card liability"" on the consolidated balance sheets. There are no expiration dates on our gift cards, and we do not charge any service fees that cause a decrement to customer balances.While we will continue to honor all gift cards presented for payment, we may determine the likelihood of redemption to be remote for certain card balances due to, among other things, long periods of inactivity. In these circumstances, to the extent we determine there is no requirement for remitting card balances to government agencies under unclaimed property laws, card balances may be recognized in the consolidated statements of operations in net revenue. The amount to be recognized is an estimate, based on historical customer redemption rates.Inventory. Inventory is valued at the lower of cost and market. We periodically review our inventories and make provisions as necessary to appropriately value obsolete and damaged goods. The amount of the provision is equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and its net realizable value based upon assumptions about future demands, selling prices and market conditions. If changes in market conditions result in reductions in the estimated net realizable value of our inventory below our previous estimate, we would increase our reserve in the period in which we made such a determination. In addition, we provide for inventory shrinkage as a percentage of sales, based on historical trends from actual physical inventories. Inventory shrinkage estimates are made to reduce the inventory value for lost or stolen items. We perform physical inventory counts throughout the year and adjust the shrink provision accordingly. In fiscal 2014, we wrote-off $12.4 million of inventory, and in fiscal 2013 we wrote-off $28.1 million of inventory, including $17.5 million related to the pull-back of black Luon pants.Property and Equipment. Property and equipment are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation. Buildings are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the expected useful life of the asset, which we estimate to be 20 years. Leasehold improvements are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the lesser of the length of the lease and the estimated useful life of the assets, up to a maximum of five years. All other property and equipment is depreciated using the declining balance method as follows: Furniture and fixtures 20%Computer hardware and software 30%Equipment and vehicles 30%Changes in circumstances (such as technological advances) can result in differences between the actual and estimated useful lives. In those cases where we determine that the useful life of a long-lived asset should be shortened, we increase depreciation expense over the remaining useful life to depreciate the asset’s net book value to its salvage value.Long-Lived Assets. Long-lived assets, including intangible assets with finite useful lives are evaluated for impairment when the occurrence of events or changes in circumstances indicates that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable as measured by comparing their net book value to the undiscounted estimated future cash flows generated by their use and eventual disposition. Impaired assets are recorded at fair value, determined principally by the present value of the estimated future cash flows expected from their use and eventual disposition. Income Taxes. Deferred income tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance, if based on the weight of available positive and negative evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.32Table of ContentsThe recognition of a deferred income tax asset is based upon several assumptions and forecasts, including current and proposed tax legislation, current and anticipated taxable income, utilization of previously unrealized non-operating loss carry forwards and regulatory reviews of tax filings. Given the judgments and estimates required and the sensitivity of the results to the significant assumptions used, we believe the accounting estimates used in relation to the recognition of deferred income tax assets are subject to measurement uncertainty and are susceptible to a material change if the underlying assumptions change.We have not recorded U.S. income tax expense for foreign earnings that we have determined to be indefinitely reinvested outside the United States. We periodically assess the need to utilize these unremitted earnings to finance our foreign operations. This assessment is based on cash flow projections by tax jurisdiction. Such estimates are inherently imprecise since many assumptions utilized in the cash flow projections are subject to revision in the future. The possibility exists that amounts determined to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the United States may ultimately be repatriated. For instance, the cash needs of our U.S. entities may exceed our current expectations, or the actual cash needs of our foreign entities may be less than our current expectations. This would result in additional income tax expense in the year we determined that amounts were no longer indefinitely reinvested.We file income tax returns in the United States, Canada and various foreign and state jurisdictions. The 2011 to 2013 tax years remain subject to examination by the U.S. federal and state tax authorities. The 2010 tax year is still open for certain state tax authorities. The 2007 to 2013 tax years remain subject to examination by Canadian tax authorities. The 2008 to 2013 tax years remain subject to examination by tax authorities in certain foreign jurisdictions. Our policy is to recognize interest expense and penalties related to income tax matters as a selling, general and administrative expense. At February 1, 2015, we do not have any significant accruals for interest related to unrecognized tax benefits or tax penalties. Our intercompany transfer pricing policies are currently subject to audits by various foreign tax jurisdictions. Although we believe that our intercompany transfer pricing policies and tax positions are reasonable, the final outcomes of tax audits or potential tax disputes may be materially different from that which is reflected in our income tax provisions and accruals.Goodwill and Intangible Assets. Intangible assets are recorded at cost. Reacquired franchise rights are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives of 10 years. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair market value of identifiable net assets acquired and is not amortized. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually or more frequently when an event or circumstance indicates that goodwill might be impaired. Goodwill impairment testing requires us to estimate the fair value of our reporting units. We generally base our measurement of the fair value on the present value of future cash flows. Our significant estimates in the discounted cash flows model include: the discount rate and long-term rates of growth. We use our best estimates and judgment based on available evidence in conducting the impairment testing. Stock-Based Compensation. We account for stock-based compensation using the fair value method. The fair value of the awards is estimated at the date of grant and recognized as employee compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. For awards with service and/or performance conditions, the amount of compensation expense recognized is based on the number of awards that are expected to vest. The estimation of the number stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment, and to the extent actual results differ from our estimates, such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised. We consider several factors when estimating the number of awards which are expected to vest, including, future profit forecasts, types of awards, size of option holder group and anticipated employee retention. Actual results may differ substantially from these estimates. The calculation of the grant-date fair value of stock options requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions, including, stock price volatility, and the expected life of the options. These assumptions are evaluated and revised, as necessary, to reflect market conditions and the Company's historical experience. The expected term of the options is based upon historical experience of similar awards, giving consideration for expectations of future employee behavior. Expected volatility is based upon the historical volatility of the Company's common stock for the period corresponding with the expected term of the options. In the future, as we gain historical data for volatility in our own stock and the actual term employees hold our options, expected volatility and expected term may change which could substantially change the grant-date fair value of future awards of stock options and, ultimately, the expense we record. Contingencies. In the ordinary course of business, we are involved in legal proceedings regarding contractual and employment relationships and a variety of other matters. We record contingent liabilities resulting from claims against us, when a loss is assessed to be probable and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable. Assessing probability of loss and estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors, including in some cases judgments about the potential actions of third-party claimants and courts. 33Table of ContentsITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKMarket risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates. Our market risk exposure is primarily a result of fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. We do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes.Foreign Currency Exchange Risk. The functional currency of our foreign subsidiaries is generally the applicable local currency. Our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars. Therefore, the net revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries are translated from their functional currencies into U.S. dollars. Fluctuations in the value of the U.S. Dollar affect the reported amounts of net revenue, expenses, assets and liabilities. Foreign exchange differences which arise on translation of our foreign subsidiaries’ balance sheets into U.S. dollars are recorded as a cumulative translation adjustment in accumulated other comprehensive income within stockholders' equity. We also have exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates associated with transactions which are undertaken by our subsidiaries in currencies other than their functional currency. Such transactions include intercompany transactions and inventory purchases denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the purchasing entity. As a result, we have been impacted by changes in exchange rates and may be impacted materially for the foreseeable future. The potential impact of currency fluctuation increases as international expansion increases.We currently generate a significant portion of our net revenue and incur a significant portion of our expenses in Canada. The reporting currency for our consolidated financial statements is the U.S. dollar. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Canadian dollar during fiscal 2014 has resulted in:•a reduction in our net revenue upon translation of the sales made by our Canadian operations into U.S. dollars for the purposes of consolidation;•a reduction in our selling, general and administrative expenses incurred by our Canadian operations into U.S. dollars for the purposes of consolidation; and•foreign exchange gains by our Canadian subsidiaries on U.S. dollar cash and receivables denominated in U.S. dollars. A 10% depreciation in the relative value of the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar compared to the exchange rates in effect for fiscal 2014 would have resulted in lost income from operations of approximately $2.2 million in fiscal 2014. This assumes a consistent 10% depreciation in the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar throughout the fiscal year. The timing of changes in the relative value of the Canadian dollar combined with the seasonal nature of our business, can affect the magnitude of the impact that fluctuations in foreign exchange rates have on our income from operations.We have not historically hedged foreign currency fluctuations. However, in the future, in an effort to mitigate losses associated with these risks, we may at times enter into derivative financial instruments, although we have not historically done so. We do not, and do not intend to, engage in the practice of trading derivative securities for profit.Interest Rate Risk. Our revolving credit facilities provide us with available borrowings in amount up to $15.0 million in the aggregate. Because our revolving credit facilities bear interest at a variable rate, we will be exposed to market risks relating to changes in interest rates, if we have a meaningful outstanding balance. As of February 1, 2015, aside from letters of credit and guarantees, we had no outstanding balances under our revolving facilities. We currently do not engage in any interest rate hedging activity and currently have no intention to do so in the foreseeable future. However, in the future, if we have a meaningful outstanding balance under our revolving facility, in an effort to mitigate losses associated with these risks, we may at times enter into derivative financial instruments, although we have not historically done so. These may take the form of forward contracts, option contracts, or interest rate swaps. We do not, and do not intend to, engage in the practice of trading derivative securities for profit. InflationInflationary factors such as increases in the cost of our product and overhead costs may adversely affect our operating results. Although we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations to date, a high rate of inflation in the future may have an adverse effect on our ability to maintain current levels of gross margin and selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenue if the selling prices of our products do not increase with these increased costs.34Table of Contents",2023-12-30 21:53:32.842716

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThis discussion summarizes our consolidated operating results, financial condition, and liquidity during the three-year period ending January 31, 2016. Our fiscal year ends on the Sunday closest to January 31 of the following year, typically resulting in a 52 week year, but occasionally giving rise to an additional week, resulting in a 53 week year. Fiscal 2015, fiscal 2014, and fiscal 2013 were 52 week years. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements based on current expectations that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions, such as our plans, objectives, expectations, and intentions set forth in the ""Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements."" Our actual results and the timing of events may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth in the ""Item 1A. Risk Factors"" section and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.OverviewFiscal 2015 was a year in which we made significant progress on our strategic priorities that positions us well for long term profitable growth. We strengthened our leadership by filling key executive positions during the year and now have in place a complete, experienced, and culturally aligned management team to drive our strategic priorities towards our 10 year vision.We reignited our product engine starting with our first global product launch, our new women's pant lines, that brought together the best of product innovation and education. We also reorganized our design and merchandising teams, resulting in a singular creative voice for our women's and men's product with a renewed focus on design and innovation.We made key investments in our website, omni-channel capabilities, supply chain, and information technology infrastructure. These are foundational investments that will support and enable our long term growth.In addition to continuing our expansion in the United States, we opened company-operated stores for the first time in Germany and Hong Kong and opened additional stores in Singapore and the United Kingdom. We also opened showrooms in new markets in France, Korea, Malaysia, Sweden, and Switzerland. As of January 31, 2016, we operated 20 showrooms in 10 different countries in Asia and Europe. In addition, our licensee in the Middle East opened two licensed stores in the United Arab Emirates during fiscal 2015.In fiscal 2016, our top priority will be first to strengthen and grow our women's category, specifically with a renewed focus on our tops. For men's, we will continue to focus on product design, while also adding more dedicated square footage through store expansions. To further grow our direct to consumer segment, we will make investments in customer relationship management, analytics, and digital marketing, while also launching our new North America website in the first half of fiscal 2016. In international markets, we will focus our efforts in key cities, while expanding into new markets where we've seen strong traction from our showroom performance. Our final priority is operational excellence, where we are investing in developing a scalable and world-class supply chain and operational infrastructure that we expect to be a key enabler of our long term growth. Financial Highlights•Our net revenue increased from $1.8 billion in fiscal 2014 to $2.1 billion in fiscal 2015, representing an annual growth rate of 15%. Our increase in net revenue from fiscal 2014 to fiscal 2015 resulted primarily from the addition of 61 net new company-operated stores and the growth of our direct to consumer segment. •Total comparable sales, which includes comparable store sales and direct to consumer, increased 5% in fiscal 2015 and increased by 10% on a constant dollar basis.•Company-operated stores accounted for 73.6% of total net revenue in fiscal 2015, 75.0% of total net revenue in fiscal 2014 and 77.3% of total net revenue in fiscal 2013. Comparable store sales increased by 4% on a constant dollar basis for fiscal 2015 primarily as the result of increased traffic which resulted in an increase in the number of transactions, and due to higher average unit retail prices.•Our direct to consumer segment is an increasingly substantial part of our growth strategy, and now represents 19.5% of our net revenue compared to 17.9% in fiscal 2014 and 16.5% in fiscal 2013. Direct to consumer net revenue increased 30% on a constant dollar basis primarily as the result of an increase in the number of transactions which was driven by increased traffic and higher conversion rates.20Table of Contents•Gross profit for fiscal 2015 increased by 9% to $997.2 million, from $914.2 million in fiscal 2014. As a percentage of net revenue, gross profit decreased to 48.4% compared to 50.9% in fiscal 2014. The decrease in the gross margin was primarily due to an increase in fixed costs, such as occupancy and depreciation, an unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates, and an increase in markdowns and discounts.•Income from operations for fiscal 2015 decreased by 2% to $369.1 million, from $376.0 million in fiscal 2014. The decrease in income from operations was a result of an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses, partially offset by an increase in gross profit. As a percentage of net revenue, income from operations decreased to 17.9% compared to 20.9% of net revenue in fiscal 2014.•Income tax expense for fiscal 2015 decreased by 29% to $102.4 million, from $144.1 million in fiscal 2014. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2015 was 27.8% compared to 37.6% for fiscal 2014. Fiscal 2015 included a net income tax recovery of $7.4 million related to our transfer pricing arrangements and estimated taxes associated with the repatriation of foreign earnings. In addition, fiscal 2015 included a related net interest expense of $3.5 million recorded in other (expense) income, net. Fiscal 2014 included an income tax expense of $33.7 million related to the repatriation of foreign earnings used to fund our share repurchase program. Our effective tax rate excluding these adjustments would have been 29.5% for fiscal 2015 compared to 28.8% for fiscal 2014.•Diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2015 were $1.89, compared to $1.66 in fiscal 2014. Excluding certain tax and related interest adjustments, diluted earnings per share were $1.86 for fiscal 2015 and $1.89 for fiscal 2014.Refer to the non-GAAP reconciliation tables contained in the ""Results of Operations"" section of this ""Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations"" for reconciliations of constant dollar total comparable sales, constant dollar comparable store sales, constant dollar changes in direct to consumer net revenue, the effective tax rate excluding certain tax and related interest adjustments, and diluted earnings per share excluding certain tax and related interest adjustments to measures calculated in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (""GAAP"").GeneralNet revenue is comprised of company-operated store sales, direct to consumer sales through www.lululemon.com, www.ivivva.com, and other country and region specific websites, and other net revenue, which includes outlet sales, showroom sales, sales to wholesale accounts, warehouse sales, sales from temporary locations, and license and supply arrangement net revenue, which consists of royalties as well as sales of our products to licensees.Cost of goods sold includes the cost of purchased merchandise, including freight, duty, and nonrefundable taxes incurred in delivering the goods to our distribution centers. It also includes occupancy costs and depreciation expense for our company-operated store locations, all costs incurred in operating our distribution centers and production, design, distribution, and merchandise departments, hemming, shrink, and inventory provision expense. The primary drivers of the costs of individual products are the costs of raw materials and labor in the countries where we source our merchandise.Selling, general and administrative expenses consist of all operating costs not otherwise included in cost of goods sold. We expect selling, general and administrative expenses to increase in fiscal 2016 as we incur additional operating expenses to support our store and direct to consumer growth, while also making strategic investments to support the long term growth of the business.Income tax expense depends on the statutory tax rates in the countries where we sell our products and the proportion of taxable income earned in those jurisdictions. To the extent the relative proportion of taxable income in the jurisdictions fluctuates, so will our effective tax rate. We also anticipate that, in the future, we may start to sell our products through retail locations located in countries in which we have not yet operated, in which case, we would become subject to taxation based on the foreign statutory rates in the countries where these sales take place and our effective tax rate could fluctuate accordingly.21Table of ContentsResults of OperationsThe following tables summarize key components of our results of operations for the periods indicated, both in dollars and as a percentage of net revenue: Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2016 February 1, 2015 February 2, 2014 (In thousands)Consolidated statements of operations: Net revenue $2,060,523 $1,797,213 $1,591,188Cost of goods sold 1,063,357 883,033 751,112Gross profit 997,166 914,180 840,076Selling, general and administrative expenses 628,090 538,147 448,718Income from operations 369,076 376,033 391,358Other (expense) income, net (581) 7,102 5,768Income before income tax expense 368,495 383,135 397,126Income tax expense 102,448 144,102 117,579Net income $266,047 $239,033 $279,547 Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2016 February 1, 2015 February 2, 2014 (% of net revenue)Net revenue 100.0 % 100.0% 100.0%Cost of goods sold 51.6 49.1 47.2Gross profit 48.4 50.9 52.8Selling, general and administrative expenses 30.5 30.0 28.2Income from operations 17.9 20.9 24.6Other (expense) income, net — 0.4 0.4Income before income tax expense 17.9 21.3 25.0Income tax expense 5.0 8.0 7.4Net income 12.9 % 13.3% 17.6%Comparison of Fiscal 2015 to Fiscal 2014 Net RevenueNet revenue increased $263.3 million, or 15%, to $2.061 billion in fiscal 2015 from $1.797 billion in fiscal 2014. Assuming the average exchange rates in fiscal 2015 remained constant with the average exchange rates in fiscal 2014, our net revenue would have increased $352.2 million, or 20%.The net revenue increase was primarily driven by sales from new stores and the growth of our direct to consumer segment. Total comparable sales, which includes comparable store sales and direct to consumer, increased 5% in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014. Excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations, total comparable sales would have increased by 10%.22Table of ContentsOur net revenue on a segment basis for fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014 is summarized below. Net revenue is expressed in dollar amounts. The percentages are presented as a percentage of total net revenue. Fiscal Years Ended January 31, 2016 and February 1, 2015 2015 2014 2015 2014 (In thousands) (Percentages)Company-operated stores $1,516,323 $1,348,225 73.6% 75.0%Direct to consumer 401,525 321,180 19.5 17.9Other 142,675 127,808 6.9 7.1Net revenue $2,060,523 $1,797,213 100.0% 100.0%Company-operated Stores. Net revenue from our company-operated stores segment increased $168.1 million, or 12%, to $1.516 billion in fiscal 2015 from $1.348 billion in fiscal 2014. During fiscal 2015 we opened 61 net new stores, which included 49 stores in the United States, three stores in Canada, four stores in the United Kingdom, two stores in Hong Kong, and one store in each of Germany, Puerto Rico, and Singapore.The increase in net revenue from our company-operated stores segment resulted from an increase of $175.4 million from non-comparable stores, which includes sales from new stores that have not been open for 12 months and sales from stores which have been significantly expanded. The increase in net revenue was partially offset by a decrease of $7.3 million from comparable store sales.Comparable store sales decreased by less than 1% in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014. Excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations, comparable store sales would have increased 4%, or $48.8 million, in fiscal 2015. Comparable store sales, excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations, increased primarily as the result of increased traffic which resulted in an increase in the number of transactions, and due to higher average unit retail prices.Direct to Consumer. Net revenue from our direct to consumer segment increased $80.3 million, or 25%, to $401.5 million in fiscal 2015 from $321.2 million in fiscal 2014. Excluding the effect of foreign exchange fluctuations, direct to consumer net revenue would have increased 30%. The increase in net revenue from our direct to consumer segment was primarily the result of an increase in the number of transactions which was driven by increased traffic and higher conversion rates on our e-commerce websites.Other. Net revenue from our other segment increased $14.9 million, or 12%, to $142.7 million in fiscal 2015 from $127.8 million in fiscal 2014. This increase was primarily the result of an increased number of outlets and an increased number of warehouse sales held during fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014. This was partially offset by fewer temporary locations open during fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014. Gross ProfitGross profit increased $83.0 million, or 9%, to $997.2 million in fiscal 2015 from $914.2 million in fiscal 2014.Gross profit, as a percentage of net revenue, or gross margin, decreased 250 basis points, to 48.4% in fiscal 2015 from 50.9% in fiscal 2014. The decrease in gross margin was primarily the result of:•an increase in fixed costs, such as occupancy costs and depreciation, relative to the increase in net revenue, of 90 basis points;•an unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates on product costs which contributed to a decrease in gross margin of 90 basis points; and•a decrease in product margin of 70 basis points, primarily due to an increase in markdowns and discounts, as well as other product related costs.Selling, General and Administrative ExpensesSelling, general and administrative expenses increased $89.9 million, or 17%, to $628.1 million in fiscal 2015 from $538.1 million in fiscal 2014. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was principally comprised of:•an increase in employee costs for our operating locations of $36.8 million, primarily from a growth in labor hours and bonuses, mainly associated with new company-operated stores;23Table of Contents•an increase in head office costs other than employee costs of $18.7 million primarily as a result of increased professional fees, including supply chain consulting costs, increased brand and community costs, and increased depreciation;•an increase in variable costs such as distribution costs, credit card fees, and packaging of $14.6 million primarily as a result of new company-operated stores as well as increased sales volume from our direct to consumer segment;•an increase in head office employee costs of $14.5 million to support the growth in our business; and•an increase in other costs of $10.9 million for our operating channels such as repairs and maintenance costs, digital marketing expenses, and store community costs.The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was partially offset by an increase in net foreign exchange revaluation gains of $5.6 million.As a percentage of net revenue, selling, general and administrative expenses increased 50 basis points, to 30.5% in fiscal 2015 from 30.0% in fiscal 2014.We expect selling, general and administrative expenses to increase in fiscal 2016 as we incur additional operating expenses to support our store and direct to consumer growth, while also making strategic investments to support the long term growth of our business.Income from OperationsIncome from operations decreased $7.0 million, or 2%, to $369.1 million in fiscal 2015 from $376.0 million in fiscal 2014. The decrease was a result of increased selling, general and administrative costs of $89.9 million, partially offset by increased gross profit of $83.0 million.On a segment basis, we determine income from operations without taking into account our general corporate expenses.Income from operations before general corporate expenses for fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014 is summarized below and is expressed in dollar amounts. The percentages are presented as a percentage of net revenue of the respective operating segments. Fiscal Years Ended January 31, 2016 and February 1, 2015 2015 2014 2015 2014 (In thousands) (Percentages)Company-operated stores $346,802 $356,589 22.9% 26.4%Direct to consumer 166,418 132,877 41.4 41.4Other 5,826 9,499 4.1 7.4Income from operations before general corporate expense 519,046 498,965 General corporate expense 149,970 122,932 Income from operations $369,076 $376,033 Company-operated Stores. Income from operations from our company-operated stores segment decreased $9.8 million, or 3%, to $346.8 million for fiscal 2015 from $356.6 million for fiscal 2014 primarily due to an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses related to employee costs as well as operating expenses associated with new stores, partially offset by an increase of $41.0 million in gross profit from increased sales. Income from operations as a percentage of company-operated stores net revenue decreased by 350 basis points primarily due to lower gross margin resulting from an increase in fixed costs relative to the increase in net revenue, unfavorable foreign exchange rates, and an increase in markdowns and discounts, as well as increased selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenue.Direct to Consumer. Income from operations from our direct to consumer segment increased $33.5 million, or 25%, to $166.4 million in fiscal 2015 from $132.9 million in fiscal 2014. The increase was primarily the result of increased gross profit of $39.8 million primarily due to increased net revenue resulting from an increase in the number of transactions which was driven by increased traffic and higher conversion rates, partially offset by increased selling, general and administrative expenses. Income from operations as a percentage of direct to consumer net revenue was 41.4% in each of fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014.Other. Income from operations from our other segment decreased $3.7 million, or 39%, to $5.8 million in fiscal 2015 from $9.5 million in fiscal 2014. Income from operations as a percentage of other net revenue decreased by 330 basis points primarily due to an increased proportion of outlet and warehouse sales within our other segment net revenue in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 that carry a lower gross margin.24Table of ContentsGeneral Corporate Expense. General corporate expense increased $27.0 million, or 22%, to $150.0 million in fiscal 2015 from $122.9 million in fiscal 2014. This increase was primarily due to increased head office employee costs, professional fees, including increased professional fees related to supply chain consulting costs, and brand and community costs to support the growth of our business. The increase in general corporate expenses was partially offset by an increase in net foreign exchange revaluation gains of $5.6 million. General corporate expenses are expected to continue to increase in future years as we grow our overall business and require increased efforts at our head office to support our company-operated stores, direct to consumer and other segments.Other (Expense) Income, NetThere was net other expense of $0.6 million in fiscal 2015 compared to net other income of $7.1 million in fiscal 2014. This was primarily the result of less interest earned on our decreased cash and cash equivalents in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 as well as a net interest expense of $3.5 million related to certain tax adjustments that are outlined in Note 15 to the audited consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this report.Income Tax ExpenseIncome tax expense decreased $41.7 million, or 29%, to $102.4 million in fiscal 2015 from $144.1 million in fiscal 2014. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2015 was 27.8% compared to 37.6% for fiscal 2014. Fiscal 2015 included certain tax adjustments which resulted in a net recovery of $7.4 million as outlined in Note 15 to the audited consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this report. Fiscal 2014 included a tax expense of $33.7 million to provide for U.S. income and applicable foreign withholding taxes on dividends of $473.7 million which were distributed during fiscal 2014 from foreign subsidiaries to the U.S. parent entity to fund our share repurchase program. Our effective tax rate excluding these adjustments would have been 29.5% for fiscal 2015 compared to 28.8% for fiscal 2014.Net IncomeNet income increased $27.0 million, or 11%, to $266.0 million in fiscal 2015 from $239.0 million in fiscal 2014. The increase in net income in fiscal 2015 was primarily due to a $83.0 million increase in gross profit resulting from new stores and the growth of our direct to consumer segment and a decrease of $41.7 million in income tax expense, partially offset by an increase of $89.9 million in selling, general and administrative expenses and a $7.7 million increase in other (expense) income, net.Comparison of Fiscal 2014 to Fiscal 2013Net RevenueNet revenue increased $206.0 million, or 13%, to $1.797 billion in fiscal 2014 from $1.591 billion in fiscal 2013. Assuming the average exchange rates in fiscal 2014 remained constant with the average exchange rates in fiscal 2013, our net revenue would have increased $241.7 million, or 15%.The net revenue increase was driven by sales from new stores and the growth of our direct to consumer segment. Total comparable sales, which includes comparable store sales and direct to consumer, increased 1% in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013. Excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations, total comparable sales would have increased by 3%.Our net revenue on a segment basis for fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013 is summarized below. Net revenue is expressed in dollar amounts. The percentages are presented as a percentage of total net revenue. Fiscal Years Ended February 1, 2015 and February 2, 2014 2014 2013 2014 2013 (In thousands) (Percentages)Company-operated stores $1,348,225 $1,228,999 75.0% 77.3%Direct to consumer 321,180 263,083 17.9 16.5Other 127,808 99,106 7.1 6.2Net revenue $1,797,213 $1,591,188 100.0% 100.0%Company-operated Stores. Net revenue from our company-operated stores segment increased $119.2 million, or 10%, to $1.348 billion in fiscal 2014 from $1.229 billion in fiscal 2013. Net revenue from company-operated stores we opened during fiscal 2014, and during fiscal 2013 prior to sales from such stores becoming part of our comparable stores base, contributed $162.0 million of the increase. Net new store openings in fiscal 2014 included 40 stores in the United States, including eight ivivva branded stores, three stores in Canada, including two ivivva branded stores, one store in Australia, one store in New 25Table of ContentsZealand, two stores in the United Kingdom, and one store in Singapore. The increase in net revenue from our company-operated stores segment was partially offset by a comparable store sales decrease of 3% in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 which resulted in a $42.8 million decrease to net revenue, including the effect of foreign currency fluctuations. Excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations, comparable store sales would have decreased 1%, or $19.1 million, in fiscal 2014. Comparable store sales have decreased, primarily as the result of lower conversion rates and lower units purchased per transaction.Direct to Consumer. Net revenue from our direct to consumer segment increased $58.1 million, or 22%, to $321.2 million in fiscal 2014 from $263.1 million in fiscal 2013. Excluding the effect of foreign exchange fluctuations, direct to consumer net revenue would have increased 24%. The increase in net revenue from our direct to consumer segment was a result of increasing traffic on our e-commerce websites.Other. Net revenue from our other segment increased $28.7 million, or 29%, to $127.8 million in fiscal 2014 from $99.1 million in fiscal 2013. The increase in net revenue from our other segment was primarily due to increased sales from our outlets, showrooms, and temporary locations. We continue to employ our other segment strategy to increase interest in our product in markets where we may not have company-operated stores.Gross ProfitGross profit increased $74.1 million, or 9%, to $914.2 million in fiscal 2014 from $840.1 million in fiscal 2013. Increased net revenue resulted in an increased gross profit. A $17.5 million inventory provision related to the pull-back of black Luon pants was recorded in cost of sales during fiscal 2013.Gross profit, as a percentage of net revenue, or gross margin, decreased 190 basis points, to 50.9% in fiscal 2014 from 52.8% in fiscal 2013. The decrease in gross margin resulted primarily from:•a decrease of 210 basis points due to product mix, increased product costs, and increased air freight costs;•an increase in expenses related to our product and supply chain departments, relative to the increase in net revenue, of 70 basis points; •an increase in fixed costs, such as occupancy costs and depreciation, relative to the increase in net revenue, of 40 basis points; and•an unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates on product costs which contributed to a decrease in gross margin of 40 basis points.The decrease in gross margin was partially offset by a decrease in provision for inventories, charged to cost of sales, of 110 basis points related to the pull-back of black Luon pants which was recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2013. A decrease in markdowns of 60 basis points driven by high sell-through of seasonal items also partially offset the decrease in gross margin.Selling, General and Administrative ExpensesSelling, general and administrative expenses increased $89.4 million, or 20%, to $538.1 million in fiscal 2014 from $448.7 million in fiscal 2013. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was principally comprised of:•an increase in employee costs of $40.2 million as there were increases in hourly wages and a growth in labor hours associated with new company-operated stores, outlets, showrooms, and other;•an increase in variable store costs of $5.7 million from new company-operated stores, outlets, showrooms, and other;•an increase in variable costs such as distribution costs, credit card fees and packaging related to our direct to consumer segment of $6.0 million as a result of increased sales volume;•an increase in administrative costs related to our direct to consumer segment of $4.4 million associated with the growth in this channel and increased head count to support it;•an increase in head office employee costs of $5.7 million from increased head count in order to position us for long-term growth, partially offset by decreased stock-based compensation;•an increase in other head office costs of $5.2 million as a result of the overall growth of our business and investment in strategic initiatives and projects;•an increase in other costs, including occupancy costs not included in cost of goods sold, of $11.4 million; and•a decrease in net foreign exchange gains of $10.8 million.26Table of ContentsAs a percentage of net revenue, selling, general and administrative expenses increased 180 basis points, to 30.0% in fiscal 2014 from 28.2% in fiscal 2013.We expect selling, general and administrative expenses to increase throughout fiscal 2015 as we add administrative and sales personnel and increase our infrastructure to support the growth in our store base.Income from OperationsIncome from operations decreased $15.3 million, or 4%, to $376.0 million in fiscal 2014 from $391.4 million in fiscal 2013. The decrease was a result of increased selling, general and administrative costs of $89.4 million, partially offset by increased gross profit of $74.1 million. The increase in selling, general and administrative costs was primarily driven by the increase in our business.On a segment basis, we determine income from operations without taking into account our general corporate expenses. Income from operations before general corporate expenses for fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013 is summarized below and is expressed in dollar amounts. The percentages are presented as a percentage of net revenue of the respective operating segments. Fiscal Years Ended February 1, 2015 and February 2, 2014 2014 2013 2014 2013 (In thousands) (Percentages)Company-operated stores $356,589 $372,267 26.4% 30.3%Direct to consumer 132,877 109,999 41.4 41.8Other 9,499 13,994 7.4 14.1Income from operations before general corporate expense 498,965 496,260 General corporate expense 122,932 104,902 Income from operations $376,033 $391,358 Company-operated Stores. Income from operations from our company-operated stores segment decreased $15.7 million, or 4%, to $356.6 million for fiscal 2014 from $372.3 million for fiscal 2013 primarily due to an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses related to employee costs as well as operating expenses associated with new stores, partially offset by an increase of $31.2 million in gross profit from increased sales. Income from operations as a percentage of company-operated stores net revenue decreased by 390 basis points primarily due to higher selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenue as well as lower gross margin resulting from product mix, increased product costs, and increased air freight costs.Direct to Consumer. Income from operations from our direct to consumer segment increased $22.9 million, or 21%, to $132.9 million in fiscal 2014 from $110.0 million in fiscal 2013. The increase was primarily the result of increased gross profit of $33.1 million primarily due to increased net revenue resulting from increased traffic, partially offset by increased selling, general and administrative expenses related to our long-term strategy for developing this channel. Income from operations as a percentage of direct to consumer net revenue decreased to 41.4% in fiscal 2014 from 41.8% in fiscal 2013.Other. Income from operations from our other segment decreased $4.5 million, or 32%, to $9.5 million in fiscal 2014 from $14.0 million in fiscal 2013. Income from operations as a percentage of other net revenue decreased by 670 basis points primarily due to an increased number of showrooms in new international markets which have a higher cost structure than North America. We continue to employ our other segment strategy to increase interest in our product in markets we have not otherwise entered with company-operated stores.General Corporate Expense. General corporate expense increased $18.0 million, or 17%, to $122.9 million in fiscal 2014 from $104.9 million in fiscal 2013. This increase was primarily due to a $10.8 million decrease in net foreign exchange gains, primarily from our Canadian operating entity. An increase in expenses related to our head office growth of $7.2 million, which was largely related to additional costs incurred to support the growth of our business, including increased professional fees related to investment in strategic initiatives and projects. General corporate expenses are expected to continue to increase in future years as we grow our overall business and require increased efforts at our head office to support our company-operated stores, direct to consumer, and other segments.27Table of ContentsOther (Expense) Income, NetThere was net other income of $7.1 million in fiscal 2014 compared to net other income of $5.8 million in fiscal 2013. This was primarily the result of increased interest earned on cash and cash equivalents.Income Tax ExpenseIncome tax expense increased $26.5 million, or 23%, to $144.1 million in fiscal 2014 from $117.6 million in fiscal 2013. In fiscal 2014, our effective tax rate was 37.6% compared to 29.6% in fiscal 2013. The increase in our effective tax rate was a result of a tax expense of $33.7 million recorded during fiscal 2014 to provide for U.S. income and applicable foreign withholding taxes on dividends of $473.7 million which were distributed during fiscal 2014 from foreign subsidiaries to the U.S. parent entity to fund the share repurchase program.Net IncomeNet income decreased $40.5 million, or 15%, to $239.0 million in fiscal 2014 from $279.5 million in fiscal 2013. The decrease in net income in fiscal 2014 was primarily due to an increase of $89.4 million in selling, general and administrative expenses, and an increase of $26.5 million in income tax expense, partially offset by a $1.3 million increase in net other income, and a $74.1 million increase in gross profit resulting from new stores and the growth of our direct to consumer segment.Comparable SalesWe separately track comparable store sales, which reflect net revenue at company-operated stores that have been open for at least 12 months. Net revenue from a store is included in comparable store sales beginning with the first month for which the store has a full month of comparable prior year sales. Non-comparable store sales include sales from new stores that have not been open for 12 months or from stores which have been significantly expanded. Also included in non-comparable stores sales are sales from direct to consumer, outlets, showrooms, wholesale accounts, warehouse sales, temporary locations, license and supply arrangements, and sales from company-operated stores which we have closed. Total comparable sales combines comparable store sales and direct to consumer sales. By measuring the change in year-over-year net revenue in stores that have been open for 12 months or more as well as the change in direct to consumer sales, total comparable sales allows us to evaluate our sales performance eliminating the impact of newly opened stores.We began to report total comparable sales in fiscal 2013, which combines comparable store sales and direct to consumer sales, excluding the 53rd week of sales from fiscal 2012. Our direct to consumer segment represents a growing portion of our net revenue as the shopping behavior of our guests evolves. Our approach to our guests supports this as it involves country and region specific websites, mobile/tablet devices in stores, social networks, and product notification emails. We therefore believe that reporting total comparable sales with comparable store sales and direct to consumer sales combined provides a more relevant metric.Various factors affect comparable sales, including:•the location of new stores relative to existing stores;•consumer preferences, buying trends and overall economic trends;•our ability to anticipate and respond effectively to customer preferences for technical athletic apparel;•competition;•changes in our merchandise mix;•pricing;•the timing of our releases of new merchandise and promotional events;•the effectiveness of our grassroots marketing efforts;•the level of customer service that we provide in our stores and on our websites;•our ability to source and distribute products efficiently; and•the number of stores we open, close (including for temporary renovations) and expand in any period.Opening new stores is an important part of our growth strategy. Accordingly, total comparable sales has limited utility for assessing the success of our growth strategy insofar as comparable sales do not reflect the performance of stores open less than 12 months.28Table of ContentsNon-GAAP Financial MeasuresNet revenue changes in constant dollars, total comparable sales in constant dollars, comparable store sales in constant dollars, changes in direct to consumer net revenue in constant dollars, the effective tax rate excluding certain tax and related interest adjustments, and diluted earnings per share excluding certain tax adjustments are non-GAAP performance measures. We provide constant dollar changes in net revenue, total comparable sales, comparable store sales, and changes in direct to consumer net revenue because we use these measures to understand the underlying growth rate of net revenue excluding the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates, which are not under management's control. We believe that disclosing these measures on a constant dollar basis is useful to investors because it enables them to better understand the level of growth of our business.We disclose the tax rate and diluted earnings per share excluding certain tax and related interest adjustments because of their comparability to our historical information as well as our diluted earnings per share guidance, which we believe is useful to investors.The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures follows, which includes more detail on the GAAP financial measure that is most directly comparable to each non-GAAP financial measure, and the related reconciliations between these financial measures.The below performance measures show the dollar and percentage change compared to the corresponding period in the prior year.Constant dollar changes in net revenue Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2016 Fiscal Year Ended February 1, 2015 (In thousands) (Percentage) (In thousands) (Percentage)Net revenue increase $263,310 15% $206,024 13%Adjustments due to foreign exchange rate changes 88,877 5 35,656 2Net revenue increase in constant dollars $352,187 20% $241,680 15%Constant dollar total comparable sales Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2016 February 1, 2015Total comparable sales 5% 1%Adjustments due to foreign exchange rate changes 5 2Total comparable sales in constant dollars 10% 3%Constant dollar comparable store sales Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2016 Fiscal Year Ended February 1, 2015 (In thousands) (Percentage) (In thousands) (Percentage)Comparable store sales $(7,335) —% $(42,801) (3)%Adjustments due to foreign exchange rate changes 56,106 4 23,712 2Comparable store sales in constant dollars $48,771 4% $(19,089) (1)%Constant dollar changes in direct to consumer net revenue Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2016 February 1, 2015Increase in direct to consumer net revenue 25% 22%Adjustments due to foreign exchange rate changes 5 2Increase in direct to consumer net revenue in constant dollars 30% 24%29Table of ContentsEffective tax rate, excluding tax and related interest adjustments Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2016 February 1, 2015Effective tax rate 27.8% 37.6 %Tax and related interest adjustments1 1.7 (8.8)Effective tax rate, excluding tax and related interest adjustments 29.5% 28.8 %_________1Please refer to Note 15 to the audited consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this report for an explanation as to the nature of these items.Diluted earnings per share, excluding tax and related interest adjustments Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2016 February 1, 2015Diluted earnings per share $1.89 $1.66Tax and related interest adjustments1 (0.03) 0.23Diluted earnings per share, excluding tax and related interest adjustments $1.86 $1.89_________1Please refer to Note 15 to the audited consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this report for an explanation as to the nature of these items.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesOur primary sources of liquidity are our current balances of cash and cash equivalents and cash flows from operations. Our primary cash needs are capital expenditures for opening new stores and remodeling or relocating existing stores, making information technology system enhancements, funding working capital requirements, and making other strategic capital investments both in North America and internationally. We may also use cash to repurchase shares of our common stock. Cash and cash equivalents in excess of our needs are held in interest bearing accounts with financial institutions.As of January 31, 2016, our working capital (excluding cash and cash equivalents) was $190.1 million and our cash and cash equivalents were $501.5 million.The following table summarizes our net cash flows provided by and used in operating, investing and financing activities for the periods indicated: Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2016 February 1, 2015 February 2, 2014 (In thousands)Total cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $298,740 $314,449 $278,339Investing activities (143,487) (119,733) (106,408)Financing activities (273,693) (149,077) 8,907Effect of exchange rate changes (44,557) (79,809) (72,368)(Decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents $(162,997) $(34,170) $108,470Operating ActivitiesCash flows provided by operating activities consist primarily of net income adjusted for certain items not affecting cash and the effect of changes in operating assets and liabilities.In fiscal 2015, cash provided by operating activities decreased $15.7 million, to $298.7 million compared to cash provided by operating activities of $314.4 million in fiscal 2014. The decrease was primarily a result of an increase in inventory purchases and an increase in prepaid and receivable income taxes. This was partially offset by an increase in net income, changes in other operating assets and liabilities, and the change in items not affecting cash. The change in items not affecting 30Table of Contentscash was primarily due to an increase in depreciation related to our increased number of stores and a reduction in net deferred income tax assets.Inventory increased during fiscal 2015 primarily due to the opening of new stores, increased inventory levels to support the sales growth in our company-operated stores and direct to consumer segments, and the timing of product deliveries. Prepaid and receivable income taxes increased during fiscal 2015 primarily as a result of certain tax adjustments as outlined in Note 15 to the audited consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this report. These adjustments resulted in an income tax receivable in the United States and an increase in income taxes payable in Canada.In fiscal 2014, cash provided by operating activities increased $36.1 million, to $314.4 million compared to cash provided by operating activities of $278.3 million in fiscal 2013. The increase was primarily a result of an increase in income taxes payable, a change in items not affecting cash, and an increase in accrued compensation and related benefits. This was partially offset by a decrease in net income, and changes in other operating assets and liabilities.The increase in income taxes payable in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 was primarily the result of taxes due on the dividends of $473.7 million which were distributed during fiscal 2014 by foreign subsidiaries to the U.S. parent entity to fund the share repurchase program.Investing ActivitiesCash flows used in investing activities relate entirely to capital expenditures. Cash used in investing activities increased $23.8 million, to $143.5 million in fiscal 2015 from $119.7 million in fiscal 2014. Cash used in investing activities increased $13.3 million, to $119.7 million in fiscal 2014 from $106.4 million in fiscal 2013.Capital expenditures for our company-operated stores segment were $85.8 million in fiscal 2015 which included $49.2 million to open 62 company-operated stores, $76.9 million in fiscal 2014 which included $38.1 million to open 49 company-operated stores, and $60.2 million in fiscal 2013 which included $31.3 million to open 45 new company-operated stores. The remaining capital expenditures for our company-operated stores segment in each period were primarily for the remodeling or relocation of certain stores, and ongoing store refurbishment.Capital expenditures for our direct to consumer segment were $8.3 million, $10.0 million, and $6.0 million in fiscal 2015, fiscal 2014, and fiscal 2013, respectively. The capital expenditures for our direct to consumer segment in each period were primarily related to website enhancements as well as country and region specific website launches. Capital expenditures related to corporate activities and other were $49.4 million, $32.9 million, and $40.2 million in fiscal 2015, fiscal 2014, and fiscal 2013, respectively. The capital expenditures in each period for corporate activities and other were for investments in information technology and business systems, improvements at our head office and other corporate buildings, and for capital expenditures related to opening retail locations other than company-operated stores.Capital expenditures are expected to range between $150 million and $155 million in fiscal 2016.Financing ActivitiesCash flows used in or provided by financing activities consist primarily of cash used to repurchase shares of our common stock and certain cash flows related to stock-based compensation. Cash used in financing activities increased $124.6 million, to $273.7 million in fiscal 2015 from $149.1 million in fiscal 2014. Cash used in financing activities increased $158.0 million, to cash used of $149.1 million in fiscal 2014 from cash provided of $8.9 million in fiscal 2013. The primary cause of these increases in cash used in financing activities was our stock repurchase program which began in the second quarter of fiscal 2014. During fiscal 2015 we repurchased 5.0 million shares for a total cost of $274.2 million, and in fiscal 2014 we repurchased 3.7 million shares for a total cost of $147.4 million.We believe that our cash and cash equivalent balances, cash generated from operations, and borrowings available to us under our revolving credit facility will be adequate to meet our liquidity needs and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months. Our cash from operations may be negatively impacted by a decrease in demand for our products as well as the other factors described in ""Item 1A. Risk Factors"". In addition, we may make discretionary capital improvements with respect to our stores, distribution facilities, headquarters, or systems, which we would expect to fund through the use of cash, issuance of debt or equity securities or other external financing sources to the extent we were unable to fund such capital expenditures out of our cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from operations.31Table of ContentsRevolving Credit FacilityIn November 2015, we renewed our unsecured demand revolving credit facilities with HSBC Bank Canada and Bank of America, N.A., Canada Branch for a one year period. The credit facilities provide us with available borrowings in a total amount of $15.0 million. Borrowings under the credit facilities must be repaid in full on demand and are available by way of U.S. or Canadian denominated advances, letters of credit or depository bills. Advances denominated in U.S. dollars bear interest on the outstanding balance at a rate equal to U.S. LIBOR plus 100 basis points or the U.S. prime rate, at our option. Advances denominated in Canadian dollars bear interest on the outstanding balance at a rate equal to the CDOR Rate plus 100 basis points or the Canadian prime rate, at our option. Borrowings drawn down under standby letters of credit bear a fee of 100 basis points and borrowings drawn down under commercial letters of credit bear the banks' standard pricing. We are also required to pay a quarterly commitment fee of 10 basis points on the unused portion of the facility. Our wholly-owned subsidiary, lululemon usa inc., has provided a guarantee to the bank counter-parties under the facilities. The revolving credit facilities are unsecured, with a negative pledge on assets subject to permitted encumbrances, and no financial covenants. As of January 31, 2016, aside from letters of credit of $1.6 million, we had no other borrowings outstanding under these credit facilities.Contractual Obligations and CommitmentsLeases. We lease certain store and other retail locations, distribution centers, offices, and equipment under non-cancelable operating leases. Our leases generally have initial terms of between five and 10 years, and generally can be extended only in five-year increments, if at all. Our leases expire at various dates between one and 15 years, excluding extensions at our option. A substantial number of our leases include renewal options and certain of our leases include rent escalation clauses, rent holidays and leasehold rental incentives, none of which are reflected in the table below. Most of our leases for store premises also include contingent rental payments based on sales, the impact of which also are not reflected in the table below. Product purchase obligations. The amounts listed for product purchase obligations in the table below represent agreements (including open purchase orders) to purchase products in the ordinary course of business that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms. In some cases, prices are subject to change throughout the production process. The reported amounts exclude product purchase liabilities included in accounts payable and accrued inventory liabilities as of January 31, 2016.The following table summarizes our contractual arrangements as of January 31, 2016, and the timing and effect that such commitments are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods: Payments Due by Fiscal Year Total 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 Thereafter (In thousands)Operating leases (minimum rent) $515,821 $107,456 $102,071 $88,193 $75,845 $52,881 $89,375Product purchase obligations $159,730 $159,730 $— $— $— $— $—Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsWe enter into standby letters of credit to secure certain of our obligations, including leases, taxes and duties. As of January 31, 2016, letters of credit and letters of guarantee totaling $1.6 million had been issued.We have not entered into any transactions, agreements or other contractual arrangements to which an entity unconsolidated with us is a party and under which we have (i) any obligation under a guarantee, (ii) any retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity that serves as credit, liquidity or market risk support to such entity, (iii) any obligation under derivative instruments that are indexed to our shares and classified as equity in our consolidated balance sheets, or (iv) any obligation arising out of a variable interest in any unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit support to us or engages in leasing, hedging or research and development services with us.Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions. Predicting future events is inherently an imprecise activity and, as such, requires the use of judgment. Actual results may vary from our estimates in amounts that may be material to the financial statements. An accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically, could materially impact our consolidated financial statements. 32Table of ContentsWe believe that the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements:Revenue Recognition. Net revenue is recognized net of sales taxes, discounts, and an estimated allowance for sales returns. Sales to customers through company-operated stores and other physical locations are recognized at the point of sale, net of an estimated allowance for sales returns. Direct to consumer sales are recognized once delivery has occurred and collection is reasonably assured, net of an estimated allowance for sales returns. Other net revenue includes outlet sales, showroom sales, sales to wholesale accounts, warehouse sales, sales from temporary locations, and license and supply arrangement net revenue, which consists of royalties as well as sales of our product to licensees. Revenue is recognized when these sales occur and amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling are recognized at the time of shipment. Employee discounts are classified as a reduction of net revenue.Our estimated allowance for sales returns is a subjective critical estimate that has a direct impact on reported net revenue. This allowance is calculated based on a history of actual returns, estimated future returns and any significant future known or anticipated events. Consideration of these factors results in an estimated allowance for sales returns. Our standard terms for retail sales limit returns to approximately 14 days after the sale of the merchandise, however we accept returns after 14 days where the product fails to meet our guests' quality expectations.Revenue from our gift cards is recognized when tendered for payment, or upon redemption. Outstanding customer balances are included in ""Unredeemed gift card liability"" on the consolidated balance sheets. There are no expiration dates on our gift cards, and we do not charge any service fees that cause a decrement to customer balances.While we will continue to honor all gift cards presented for payment, we may determine the likelihood of redemption to be remote for certain card balances due to, among other things, long periods of inactivity. In these circumstances, to the extent we determine there is no requirement for remitting card balances to government agencies under unclaimed property laws, card balances may be recognized in the consolidated statements of operations in net revenue. The amount recognized is an estimate, based on historical customer redemption rates.Inventory. Inventory is valued at the lower of cost and market. We periodically review our inventories and make provisions as necessary to appropriately value obsolete and damaged goods. The amount of the provision is equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and its net realizable value based upon assumptions about future demands, selling prices, and market conditions. If changes in market conditions result in reductions in the estimated net realizable value of our inventory below our previous estimate, we would increase our reserve in the period in which we made such a determination. In addition, we provide for inventory shrinkage as a percentage of sales, based on historical trends from actual physical inventories. Inventory shrinkage estimates are made to reduce the inventory value for lost or stolen items. We perform physical inventory counts throughout the year and adjust the shrink provision accordingly. Property and Equipment. Property and equipment are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation. Buildings are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the expected useful life of the asset, which we estimate to be 20 years. Leasehold improvements are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the lesser of the length of the lease and the estimated useful life of the assets, up to a maximum of five years. All other property and equipment is depreciated using the declining balance method as follows: Furniture and fixtures 20%Computer hardware and software 30%Equipment and vehicles 30%Changes in circumstances (such as technological advances) can result in differences between the actual and estimated useful lives. In those cases where we determine that the useful life of a long-lived asset should be shortened, we increase depreciation expense over the remaining useful life to depreciate the asset's net book value to its salvage value.Long-Lived Assets. Long-lived assets, including intangible assets with finite useful lives are evaluated for impairment when the occurrence of events or changes in circumstances indicates that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable as measured by comparing their net book value to the undiscounted estimated future cash flows generated by their use and eventual disposition. Impaired assets are recorded at fair value, determined principally by the present value of the estimated future cash flows expected from their use and eventual disposition. Income Taxes. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities, and for tax losses, tax credit carry forwards, and other tax attributes, using the enacted tax rates that are to be in effect when these differences are expected to reverse. 33Table of ContentsDeferred income tax liabilities are provided for U.S. income taxes on the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries, unless those earnings can be distributed on a tax-free basis or if the earnings are indefinitely reinvested. We determine on a regular basis the amount of undistributed earnings that will be indefinitely reinvested in our non-U.S. operations. This assessment is based on the cash flow projections and operational and fiscal objectives of each of our U.S. and foreign subsidiaries. Such estimates are inherently imprecise since many assumptions used in the projections are subject to revision. The possibility exists that amounts determined to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the U.S. may ultimately be repatriated.U.S. income and foreign withholding taxes have not been provided on approximately $425.2 million of cumulative undistributed earnings of a Canadian subsidiary as of January 31, 2016. These earnings are indefinitely reinvested outside of the United States. Income taxes of approximately $16.6 million would be incurred if these earnings were repatriated to the United States.As of January 31, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents of $437.5 million outside of the United States. As described in Note 15 to the audited consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this report, we intend to distribute $156.0 million from a Canadian subsidiary to the U.S. parent entity to finance the payment of an intercompany debt. We have recognized a deferred tax liability of $7.8 million to provide for U.S. income and applicable foreign withholding taxes on this expected distribution. With the exception of this amount, we do not intend to repatriate these funds to the United States.We evaluate our tax filing positions and recognize the largest amount of tax benefit that is considered more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. This determination requires the use of significant judgment. Income tax expense is adjusted in the period in which an uncertain tax position is effectively settled, the statute of limitations expires, facts or circumstances change, tax laws change, or new information becomes available. Our intercompany transfer pricing policies are currently subject to audits by various foreign tax jurisdictions. Although we believe that our intercompany transfer pricing policies and tax positions are reasonable, the final outcomes of tax audits or potential tax disputes may be materially different from that which is reflected in our income tax provisions and accruals.Goodwill and Intangible Assets. Intangible assets are recorded at cost. Reacquired franchise rights are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives of 10 years. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair market value of identifiable net assets acquired and is not amortized. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually or more frequently when an event or circumstance indicates that goodwill might be impaired. Goodwill impairment testing requires us to estimate the fair value of our reporting units. We generally base our measurement of the fair value on the present value of future cash flows. Our significant estimates in the discounted cash flows model include the discount rate and long-term rates of growth. We use our best estimates and judgment based on available evidence in conducting the impairment testing. Stock-Based Compensation. We account for stock-based compensation using the fair value method. The fair value of awards granted is estimated at the date of grant and is recognized as employee compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. For awards with service and/or performance conditions, the amount of compensation expense recognized is based on the number of awards that are expected to vest. The estimation of the number of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment, and to the extent actual results differ from our estimates, such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised. We consider several factors when estimating the number of awards which are expected to vest, including, future profit forecasts, types of awards, size of option holder group, and anticipated employee retention. Actual results may differ substantially from these estimates. The calculation of the grant-date fair value of stock options requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions, including, stock price volatility, and the expected life of the options. We evaluate and revise these estimates and assumptions as necessary, to reflect market conditions and our historical experience. The expected term of the options is based upon historical experience of similar awards, giving consideration to expectations of future employee behavior. Expected volatility is based upon the historical volatility of our common stock for the period corresponding with the expected term of the options. In the future, the expected volatility and expected term may change which could substantially change the grant-date fair value of future awards of stock options and, ultimately, the expense we record. Contingencies. In the ordinary course of business, we are involved in legal proceedings regarding contractual and employment relationships and a variety of other matters. We record contingent liabilities resulting from claims against us, when a loss is assessed to be probable and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable. Assessing probability of loss and estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors, including in some cases judgments about the potential actions of third-party claimants and courts. 34Table of ContentsITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKMarket risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates. Our market risk exposure is primarily a result of fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. We do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes.Foreign Currency Exchange Risk. The functional currency of our foreign subsidiaries is generally the applicable local currency. Our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars. Therefore, the net revenues, expenses, assets, and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries are translated from their functional currencies into U.S. dollars. Fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar affect the reported amounts of net revenue, expenses, assets, and liabilities. Foreign exchange differences which arise on translation of our foreign subsidiaries' balance sheets into U.S. dollars are recorded as a foreign currency translation adjustment in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss within stockholders' equity. We also have exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates associated with transactions which are undertaken by our subsidiaries in currencies other than their functional currency. Such transactions include intercompany transactions and inventory purchases denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the purchasing entity. As a result, we have been impacted by changes in exchange rates and may be impacted materially for the foreseeable future. The potential impact of currency fluctuation increases as international expansion increases.We currently generate a significant portion of our net revenue and incur a significant portion of our expenses in Canada. We also hold a significant portion of our net assets in Canada. The reporting currency for our consolidated financial statements is the U.S. dollar. A strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Canadian dollar results in:•a reduction in our net revenue upon translation of the sales made by our Canadian operations into U.S. dollars for the purposes of consolidation;•a reduction in our selling, general and administrative expenses incurred by our Canadian operations into U.S. dollars for the purposes of consolidation; and•foreign exchange gains by our Canadian subsidiaries on U.S. dollar cash and receivables denominated in U.S. dollars. During fiscal 2015, the change in the relative value of the U.S. dollar against the Canadian dollar resulted in a $63.2 million increase in accumulated other comprehensive loss within stockholders' equity. During fiscal 2014, the change in the relative value of the U.S. dollar against the Canadian dollar resulted in a $103.3 million increase in accumulated other comprehensive loss within stockholders' equity.A 10% appreciation in the relative value of the U.S. dollar against the Canadian dollar compared to the exchange rates in effect for fiscal 2015 would have resulted in lost income from operations of approximately $2.2 million in fiscal 2015. This assumes a consistent 10% appreciation in the U.S. dollar against the Canadian dollar throughout the fiscal year. The timing of changes in the relative value of the U.S. dollar combined with the seasonal nature of our business, can affect the magnitude of the impact that fluctuations in foreign exchange rates have on our income from operations.We have not historically hedged foreign currency fluctuations. However, in the future, in an effort to mitigate losses associated with these risks, we may at times enter into derivative financial instruments, although we have not historically done so. We do not, and do not intend to, engage in the practice of trading derivative securities for profit.Interest Rate Risk. Our revolving credit facilities provide us with available borrowings in amount up to $15.0 million in the aggregate. Because our revolving credit facilities bear interest at a variable rate, we will be exposed to market risks relating to changes in interest rates, if we have a meaningful outstanding balance. As of January 31, 2016, aside from letters of credit, we had no outstanding balances under our revolving facilities. We currently do not engage in any interest rate hedging activity and currently have no intention to do so in the foreseeable future. However, in the future, if we have a meaningful outstanding balance under our revolving facility, in an effort to mitigate losses associated with these risks, we may at times enter into derivative financial instruments, although we have not historically done so. These may take the form of forward contracts, option contracts, or interest rate swaps. We do not, and do not intend to, engage in the practice of trading derivative securities for profit.InflationInflationary factors such as increases in the cost of our product and overhead costs may adversely affect our operating results. Although we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations to date, a high rate of inflation in the future may have an adverse effect on our ability to maintain current levels of gross margin and selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenue if the selling prices of our products do not increase with these increased costs.35Table of Contents",2023-12-30 21:53:29.312949
1397187,LULU,lululemon athletica inc.,2017,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSOur fiscal year ends on the Sunday closest to January 31 of the following year, typically resulting in a 52 week year, but occasionally giving rise to an additional week, resulting in a 53 week year. Fiscal 2016, fiscal 2015, and fiscal 2014 were 52 week years. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements based on current expectations that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions, such as our plans, objectives, expectations, and intentions set forth in the ""Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements."" Our actual results and the timing of events may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth in the ""Item 1A. Risk Factors"" section and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.OverviewFiscal 2016 was a year in which successful execution against our long-term strategies returned the Company to positive operating income growth for the first time in three years. We have renewed our design-led focus, blending function and fashion with a solid innovation pipeline in place to fuel our long term growth.We continued to optimize and strategically grow our square footage in North America, exploring new concepts such as our co-located stores and Locals that are tailored and unique to each community.We made meaningful progress towards building a robust digital ecosystem with key investments in customer relationship management, analytics, and omni-channel capabilities which will be essential in continuing to elevate our guest experience across all touch points.We continued to expand our collective globally through our international expansion, opening 11 stores in Asia and Europe, which included our first stores in China, South Korea, and Switzerland. As of January 29, 2017, we operated a total of 54 stores across nine countries outside of North America.Lastly, we made significant improvements to our product and supply chain infrastructure which resulted in 280 basis points of gross margin expansion from fiscal 2015.Looking forward in fiscal 2017, we will continue to focus our growth efforts across our four key strategic pillars:1.Within product innovation, our design-led vision will be concentrated on driving innovation in both our women's and men's categories.2.Our digital strategy will center on pursuing our channel agnostic model, improving our web and mobile experience, and leveraging our guest database to amplify how we connect with our collective both online and in-store.3.In North America, our priorities are to continue to optimize our square footage through tailored and curated formats that fit with each community, while expanding our omni-channel capabilities. 4.Finally, in our international markets, our focus is on accelerating our expansion through store densification in key strategic cities while driving brand awareness and guest acquisition in new and existing markets.These priorities and investments will continue to position us well for sustainable long term profitable growth.Financial Highlights•Net revenue increased 14% to $2.3 billion in fiscal 2016, from $2.1 billion in fiscal 2015. On a constant dollar basis, net revenue increased 14%. Net revenue increased across all segments, and the increase in net revenue was primarily due to the addition of 43 net new company-operated stores during fiscal 2016, as well as increased comparable store sales and the growth of our direct to consumer segment.•Total comparable sales, which includes comparable store sales and direct to consumer, increased 6% in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015, or by 7% on a constant dollar basis.•Comparable store sales increased 4% in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015, or by 5% on a constant dollar basis, primarily as a result of increased dollar value per transaction and improved conversion rates.19Table of Contents•Direct to consumer net revenue increased 13% in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015, or by 13% on a constant dollar basis, primarily as a result of increased traffic on our e-commerce websites, increased dollar value per transaction, and improved conversion rates.•Gross profit for fiscal 2016 increased 20% to $1.2 billion, from $1.0 billion in fiscal 2015. Gross profit as a percentage of net revenue, or gross margin, increased to 51.2% compared to 48.4% in fiscal 2015. The increase in gross margin was primarily due to lower product costs and improved average retail prices, partially offset by increased expenses related to our product and supply chain departments and increased occupancy and depreciation costs.•Income from operations for fiscal 2016 increased 14% to $421.2 million, from $369.1 million in fiscal 2015. As a percentage of net revenue, income from operations increased to 18.0% compared to 17.9% of net revenue in fiscal 2015.•Income tax expense for fiscal 2016 increased 16% to $119.3 million, from $102.4 million in fiscal 2015. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2016 was 28.2% compared to 27.8% for fiscal 2015. Fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015 included net income tax recoveries and related net interest expenses as a result of the finalization of an Advance Pricing Arrangement with the Internal Revenue Service and the Canada Revenue Agency. Our effective tax rate excluding these adjustments was 30.7% for fiscal 2016 compared to 29.5% for fiscal 2015.•Diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2016 were $2.21 compared to $1.89 in fiscal 2015. Excluding the above tax and related interest adjustments, diluted earnings per share were $2.14 for fiscal 2016 and $1.86 for fiscal 2015.Refer to the non-GAAP reconciliation tables contained in the ""Non-GAAP Financial Measures"" section of this ""Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations"" for reconciliations between constant dollar changes in net revenue, total comparable sales, comparable store sales, and direct to consumer net revenue, and the effective tax rate and diluted earnings per share excluding certain tax and related interest adjustments, and the most directly comparable measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.GeneralNet revenue is comprised of company-operated store sales, direct to consumer sales through www.lululemon.com, www.ivivva.com, and other country and region specific websites, and other net revenue, which includes outlet sales, showroom sales, sales from temporary locations, sales to wholesale accounts, warehouse sales, and license and supply arrangement net revenue, which consists of royalties as well as sales of our products to licensees.Cost of goods sold includes the cost of purchased merchandise, including freight, duty, and nonrefundable taxes incurred in delivering the goods to our distribution centers. It also includes occupancy costs and depreciation expense for our company-operated store locations, all costs incurred in operating our distribution centers and production, design, distribution, and merchandise departments, hemming, shrink, and inventory provision expense. The primary drivers of the costs of individual products are the costs of raw materials and labor in the countries where we source our merchandise.Selling, general and administrative expenses consist of all operating costs not otherwise included in cost of goods sold. We expect selling, general and administrative expenses to increase in fiscal 2017 as we incur additional operating expenses to support our store and direct to consumer growth, while also making strategic investments to support the long term growth of the business.Income tax expense depends on the statutory tax rates in the countries where we sell our products and the proportion of taxable income earned in those jurisdictions. To the extent the relative proportion of taxable income in the jurisdictions fluctuates, or the tax legislation in the respective jurisdictions changes, so will our effective tax rate. We also anticipate that, in the future, we may start to sell our products through retail locations in countries in which we have not yet operated, in which case, we would become subject to taxation based on the foreign statutory rates in the countries where these sales take place and our effective tax rate could fluctuate accordingly.20Table of ContentsResults of OperationsThe following tables summarize key components of our results of operations for the periods indicated, both in dollars and as a percentage of net revenue: Fiscal Year Ended January 29, 2017 January 31, 2016 February 1, 2015 (In thousands)Net revenue $2,344,392 $2,060,523 $1,797,213Cost of goods sold 1,144,775 1,063,357 883,033Gross profit 1,199,617 997,166 914,180Selling, general and administrative expenses 778,465 628,090 538,147Income from operations 421,152 369,076 376,033Other income (expense), net 1,577 (581) 7,102Income before income tax expense 422,729 368,495 383,135Income tax expense 119,348 102,448 144,102Net income $303,381 $266,047 $239,033 Fiscal Year Ended January 29, 2017 January 31, 2016 February 1, 2015 (Percentages)Net revenue 100.0% 100.0 % 100.0%Cost of goods sold 48.8 51.6 49.1Gross profit 51.2 48.4 50.9Selling, general and administrative expenses 33.2 30.5 30.0Income from operations 18.0 17.9 20.9Other income (expense), net — — 0.4Income before income tax expense 18.0 17.9 21.3Income tax expense 5.1 5.0 8.0Net income 12.9% 12.9 % 13.3%Comparison of Fiscal 2016 to Fiscal 2015 Net RevenueNet revenue increased $283.9 million, or 14%, to $2.344 billion in fiscal 2016 from $2.061 billion in fiscal 2015. On a constant dollar basis, assuming the average exchange rates in fiscal 2016 remained constant with the average exchange rates in fiscal 2015, net revenue increased $292.9 million, or 14%.Net revenue increased across all segments. The increase in net revenue was primarily due to the addition of 43 net new company-operated stores during fiscal 2016, as well as increased comparable store sales and the growth of our direct to consumer segment. Total comparable sales, which includes comparable store sales and direct to consumer, increased 6% in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015. Total comparable sales increased 7% on a constant dollar basis.Our net revenue on a segment basis for fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015 is summarized below. Net revenue is expressed in dollar amounts. The percentages are presented as a percentage of total net revenue. Fiscal Years Ended January 29, 2017 and January 31, 2016 2016 2015 2016 2015 (In thousands) (Percentages)Company-operated stores $1,704,357 $1,516,323 72.7% 73.6%Direct to consumer 453,287 401,525 19.3 19.5Other 186,748 142,675 8.0 6.9Net revenue $2,344,392 $2,060,523 100.0% 100.0%21Table of ContentsCompany-Operated Stores. Net revenue from our company-operated stores segment increased $188.0 million, or 12%, to $1.704 billion in fiscal 2016 from $1.516 billion in fiscal 2015. The following contributed to the increase in net revenue from our company-operated stores segment:•Net revenue from company-operated stores we opened or significantly expanded subsequent to January 31, 2016, and therefore not included in comparable store sales, contributed $126.7 million to the increase. During fiscal 2016 we opened 43 net new company-operated stores, which included 27 stores in the United States, four stores in Canada, three stores in each of China and the United Kingdom, two stores in South Korea, and one store in each of Australia, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Switzerland.•A comparable store sales increase of 4% in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 resulted in a $61.3 million increase to net revenue. Comparable store sales increased 5%, or $66.4 million on a constant dollar basis. The increase in comparable store sales was primarily as a result of increased dollar value per transaction and improved conversion rates.Direct to Consumer. Net revenue from our direct to consumer segment increased $51.8 million, or 13%, to $453.3 million in fiscal 2016 from $401.5 million in fiscal 2015. Direct to consumer net revenue increased 13% on a constant dollar basis. The increase in net revenue from our direct to consumer segment was primarily the result of increased traffic on our e-commerce websites, increased dollar value per transaction and improved conversion rates.Other. Net revenue from our other segment increased $44.1 million, or 31%, to $186.7 million in fiscal 2016 from $142.7 million in fiscal 2015. This increase was primarily the result of an increased number of outlets which were open for the full year in fiscal 2016, increased net revenue at other existing outlets, and an increase in the number of temporary locations.Gross ProfitGross profit increased $202.5 million, or 20%, to $1.200 billion in fiscal 2016 from $997.2 million in fiscal 2015.Gross profit as a percentage of net revenue, or gross margin, increased 280 basis points, to 51.2% in fiscal 2016 from 48.4% in fiscal 2015. The increase in gross margin was primarily the result of an increase in product margin of 330 basis points, primarily due to lower product costs, improved average retail prices, and lower costs related to our raw material commitments.The increase in gross margin was partially offset by an increase in expenses related to our product and supply chain departments of 20 basis points, an increase in occupancy costs and depreciation of 20 basis points, and an unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates of 10 basis points.Selling, General and Administrative ExpensesSelling, general and administrative expenses increased $150.4 million, or 24%, to $778.5 million in fiscal 2016 from $628.1 million in fiscal 2015. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was principally comprised of:•an increase in employee costs for our operating locations of $47.0 million, primarily from a growth in labor hours and bonuses, mainly associated with new company-operated stores;•an increase in head office employee costs of $35.4 million to support the growth in our business;•an increase in head office costs other than employee costs of $21.2 million primarily as a result of increased brand and community costs, increased depreciation, and increased information technology costs;•an increase in net foreign exchange revaluation losses of $20.3 million, primarily related to the revaluation of U.S. dollar cash and receivables held in Canadian subsidiaries. There were net foreign exchange losses of $8.3 million in fiscal 2016 compared to net foreign exchange gains of $12.0 million in fiscal 2015.•an increase in other costs of $18.5 million for our operating channels such as digital marketing expenses, repairs and maintenance costs, and increased depreciation; and•an increase in variable costs such as credit card fees and distribution costs of $8.1 million primarily as a result of increased sales.As a percentage of net revenue, selling, general and administrative expenses increased 270 basis points, to 33.2% in fiscal 2016 from 30.5% in fiscal 2015.22Table of ContentsIncome from OperationsIncome from operations increased $52.1 million, or 14%, to $421.2 million in fiscal 2016 from $369.1 million in fiscal 2015. The increase was a result of increased gross profit of $202.5 million, partially offset by increased selling, general and administrative costs of $150.4 million.On a segment basis, we determine income from operations without taking into account our general corporate expenses.Income from operations before general corporate expenses for fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015 is summarized below and is expressed in dollar amounts. The percentages are presented as a percentage of net revenue of the respective operating segments. Fiscal Years Ended January 29, 2017 and January 31, 2016 2016 2015 2016 2015 (In thousands) (Percentages)Company-operated stores $415,635 $346,802 24.4% 22.9%Direct to consumer 186,178 166,418 41.1 41.4Other 22,312 5,826 11.9 4.1Income from operations before general corporate expenses 624,125 519,046 General corporate expenses 202,973 149,970 Income from operations $421,152 $369,076 Company-Operated Stores. Income from operations from our company-operated stores segment increased $68.8 million, or 20%, to $415.6 million for fiscal 2016 from $346.8 million for fiscal 2015. The increase was primarily the result of an increase in gross profit of $132.8 million, which was primarily due to increased net revenue and higher gross margin. Net revenue increased as a result of new stores as well as increased comparable store sales, which was primarily a result of increased dollar value per transaction and improved conversion rates. This was partially offset by an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses, including increased store employee costs and increased operating expenses associated with new stores and increased net revenue at existing stores. Income from operations as a percentage of company-operated stores net revenue increased by 150 basis points primarily due to increased gross margin, partially offset by deleverage of selling, general and administrative expenses.Direct to Consumer. Income from operations from our direct to consumer segment increased $19.8 million, or 12%, to $186.2 million in fiscal 2016 from $166.4 million in fiscal 2015. The increase was primarily the result of increased gross profit of $43.2 million primarily due to increased net revenue resulting from an increase in traffic on our e-commerce websites, increased dollar value per transaction, and improved conversion rates. This was partially offset by an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses including higher digital marketing expenses and higher variable costs such as distribution costs and credit card fees as a result of increased net revenue. Income from operations as a percentage of direct to consumer net revenue has decreased by 30 basis points primarily due to deleverage of selling, general and administrative expenses, partially offset by an increase in gross margin.Other. Income from operations from our other segment increased $16.5 million, or 283%, to $22.3 million in fiscal 2016 from $5.8 million in fiscal 2015. The increase was primarily the result of increased gross profit of $26.4 million, partially offset by increased selling, general and administrative expenses primarily due to increased employee costs. Income from operations as a percentage of other net revenue increased by 780 basis points primarily due to an increase in gross margin and decreased selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of other net revenue. General Corporate Expenses. General corporate expenses increased $53.0 million, or 35%, to $203.0 million in fiscal 2016 from $150.0 million in fiscal 2015. This increase was primarily due to increased head office employee costs, brand and community costs, depreciation, and information technology costs. There was also a $20.3 million increase in foreign exchange revaluation losses. We expect general corporate expenses to continue to increase in future years as we grow our overall business and require increased efforts at our head office to support our company-operated stores, direct to consumer and other segments.Other Income (Expense), NetThere was net other income of $1.6 million in fiscal 2016 compared to net other expense of $0.6 million in fiscal 2015. This was primarily the result of a $1.8 million reduction in net interest expense related to certain tax adjustments that are outlined in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this report, as well as interest earned on our increased cash and cash equivalents in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015.23Table of ContentsIncome Tax ExpenseIncome tax expense increased $16.9 million, or 16%, to $119.3 million in fiscal 2016 from $102.4 million in fiscal 2015. Fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015 included certain tax adjustments which resulted in net income tax recoveries of $10.7 million and $7.4 million, respectively, as outlined in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this report.Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2016 was 28.2% compared to 27.8% for fiscal 2015. Our effective tax rate excluding the above tax and related interest adjustments was 30.7% for fiscal 2016 compared to 29.5% for fiscal 2015.Net IncomeNet income increased $37.4 million, or 14%, to $303.4 million in fiscal 2016 from $266.0 million in fiscal 2015. The increase in net income in fiscal 2016 was primarily due to a $202.5 million increase in gross profit and an increase in other income (expense), net of $2.2 million, partially offset by an increase of $150.4 million in selling, general and administrative expenses and an increase of $16.9 million in income tax expense.Comparison of Fiscal 2015 to Fiscal 2014Net RevenueNet revenue increased $263.3 million, or 15%, to $2.061 billion in fiscal 2015 from $1.797 billion in fiscal 2014. On a constant dollar basis, assuming the average exchange rates in fiscal 2015 remained constant with the average exchange rates in fiscal 2014, net revenue increased $352.2 million, or 20%.The net revenue increase was primarily driven by sales from new stores and the growth of our direct to consumer segment. Total comparable sales, which includes comparable store sales and direct to consumer, increased 5% in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014. Total comparable sales increased 10% on a constant dollar basis.Our net revenue on a segment basis for fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014 is summarized below. Net revenue is expressed in dollar amounts.

Net revenue from our company-operated stores segment increased $168.1 million, or 12%, to $1.516 billion in fiscal 2015 from $1.348 billion in fiscal 2014. During fiscal 2015 we opened 61 net new stores, which included 49 stores in the United States, three stores in Canada, four stores in the United Kingdom, two stores in Hong Kong, and one store in each of Germany, Puerto Rico, and Singapore. The increase in net revenue from our company-operated stores segment resulted from an increase of $175.4 million from non-comparable stores, which includes sales from new stores that have not been open for 12 months and sales from stores which have been significantly expanded. The increase in net revenue was partially offset by a decrease of $7.3 million from comparable store sales.Comparable store sales decreased by less than 1% in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014. Comparable store sales increased 4%, or $48.8 million on a constant dollar basis. Comparable store sales on a constant dollar basis increased primarily as the result of increased traffic which resulted in an increase in the number of transactions, and due to higher average unit retail prices.Direct to Consumer. Net revenue from our direct to consumer segment increased $80.3 million, or 25%, to $401.5 million in fiscal 2015 from $321.2 million in fiscal 2014. Direct to consumer net revenue increased 30% on a constant dollar basis. The increase in net revenue from our direct to consumer segment was primarily the result of an increase in the number of transactions which was driven by increased traffic and higher conversion rates on our e-commerce websites.24Table of ContentsOther. Net revenue from our other segment increased $14.9 million, or 12%, to $142.7 million in fiscal 2015 from $127.8 million in fiscal 2014. This increase was primarily the result of an increased number of outlets and an increased number of warehouse sales held during fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014. This was partially offset by fewer temporary locations open during fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014. Gross ProfitGross profit increased $83.0 million, or 9%, to $997.2 million in fiscal 2015 from $914.2 million in fiscal 2014. Gross profit as a percentage of net revenue, or gross margin, decreased 250 basis points, to 48.4% in fiscal 2015 from 50.9% in fiscal 2014. The decrease in gross margin was primarily the result of:•an increase in fixed costs, such as occupancy costs and depreciation, relative to the increase in net revenue, of 90 basis points; •an unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates on product costs which contributed to a decrease in gross margin of 90 basis points; and•a decrease in product margin of 70 basis points, primarily due to an increase in markdowns and discounts, as well as other product related costs.Selling, General and Administrative ExpensesSelling, general and administrative expenses increased $89.9 million, or 17%, to $628.1 million in fiscal 2015 from $538.1 million in fiscal 2014. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was principally comprised of:•an increase in employee costs for our operating locations of $36.8 million, primarily from a growth in labor hours and bonuses, mainly associated with new company-operated stores;•an increase in head office costs other than employee costs of $18.7 million primarily as a result of increased professional fees, including supply chain consulting costs, increased brand and community costs, and increased depreciation;•an increase in variable costs such as distribution costs, credit card fees, and packaging of $14.6 million primarily as a result of new company-operated stores as well as increased sales volume from our direct to consumer segment;•an increase in head office employee costs of $14.5 million to support the growth in our business; and•an increase in other costs of $10.9 million for our operating channels such as repairs and maintenance costs, digital marketing expenses, and store community costs.•The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was partially offset by an increase in net foreign exchange revaluation gains of $5.6 million.As a percentage of net revenue, selling, general and administrative expenses increased 50 basis points, to 30.5% in fiscal 2015 from 30.0% in fiscal 2014.Income from OperationsIncome from operations decreased $7.0 million, or 2%, to $369.1 million in fiscal 2015 from $376.0 million in fiscal 2014. The decrease was a result of increased selling, general and administrative costs of $89.9 million, partially offset by increased gross profit of $83.0 million. On a segment basis, we determine income from operations without taking into account our general corporate expenses. 25Table of ContentsIncome from operations before general corporate expenses for fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014 is summarized below and is expressed in dollar amounts. The percentages are presented as a percentage of net revenue of the respective operating segments. Fiscal Years Ended January 31, 2016 and February 1, 2015 2015 2014 2015 2014 (In thousands) (Percentages)Company-operated stores $346,802 $356,589 22.9% 26.4%Direct to consumer 166,418 132,877 41.4 41.4Other 5,826 9,499 4.1 7.4Income from operations before general corporate expenses 519,046 498,965 General corporate expenses 149,970 122,932 Income from operations $369,076 $376,033 Company-Operated Stores. Income from operations from our company-operated stores segment decreased $9.8 million, or 3%, to $346.8 million for fiscal 2015 from $356.6 million for fiscal 2014 primarily due to an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses related to employee costs as well as operating expenses associated with new stores, partially offset by an increase of $41.0 million in gross profit from increased sales. Income from operations as a percentage of company-operated stores net revenue decreased by 350 basis points primarily due to lower gross margin resulting from an increase in fixed costs relative to the increase in net revenue, unfavorable foreign exchange rates, and an increase in markdowns and discounts, as well as increased selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenue.Direct to Consumer. Income from operations from our direct to consumer segment increased $33.5 million, or 25%, to $166.4 million in fiscal 2015 from $132.9 million in fiscal 2014. The increase was primarily the result of increased gross profit of $39.8 million primarily due to increased net revenue resulting from an increase in the number of transactions which was driven by increased traffic and higher conversion rates, partially offset by increased selling, general and administrative expenses. Income from operations as a percentage of direct to consumer net revenue was 41.4% in each of fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014.Other. Income from operations from our other segment decreased $3.7 million, or 39%, to $5.8 million in fiscal 2015 from $9.5 million in fiscal 2014. Income from operations as a percentage of other net revenue decreased by 330 basis points primarily due to an increased proportion of outlet and warehouse sales within our other segment net revenue in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 that carry a lower gross margin.General Corporate Expenses. General corporate expenses increased $27.0 million, or 22%, to $150.0 million in fiscal 2015 from $122.9 million in fiscal 2014. This increase was primarily due to increased head office employee costs, professional fees, including increased professional fees related to supply chain consulting costs, and brand and community costs to support the growth of our business. The increase in general corporate expenses was partially offset by an increase in net foreign exchange revaluation gains of $5.6 million. Other Income (Expense), NetThere was net other expense of $0.6 million in fiscal 2015 compared to net other income of $7.1 million in fiscal 2014. This was primarily the result of less interest earned on our decreased cash and cash equivalents in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 as well as a net interest expense of $3.5 million related to certain tax adjustments that are outlined in Note 15 to the audited consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this report.Income Tax ExpenseIncome tax expense decreased $41.7 million, or 29%, to $102.4 million in fiscal 2015 from $144.1 million in fiscal 2014. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2015 was 27.8% compared to 37.6% for fiscal 2014. Fiscal 2015 included certain tax adjustments which resulted in a net recovery of $7.4 million as outlined in Note 15 to the audited consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this report. Fiscal 2014 included a tax expense of $33.7 million to provide for U.S. income and applicable foreign withholding taxes on dividends of $473.7 million which were distributed during fiscal 2014 from foreign subsidiaries to the U.S. parent entity to fund our share repurchase program. Our effective tax rate excluding these adjustments was 29.5% for fiscal 2015 compared to 28.8% for fiscal 2014.26Table of ContentsNet IncomeNet income increased $27.0 million, or 11%, to $266.0 million in fiscal 2015 from $239.0 million in fiscal 2014. The increase in net income in fiscal 2015 was primarily due to a $83.0 million increase in gross profit resulting from new stores and the growth of our direct to consumer segment and a decrease of $41.7 million in income tax expense, partially offset by an increase of $89.9 million in selling, general and administrative expenses and a $7.7 million increase in other income (expense), net.Comparable SalesWe separately track comparable store sales, which reflect net revenue from company-operated stores that have been open for at least 12 months, or open for at least 12 months after being significantly expanded. Net revenue from a store is included in comparable store sales beginning with the first month for which the store has a full month of sales in the prior year. Comparable store sales exclude sales from new stores that have not been open for at least 12 months, from stores which have not been in their significantly expanded space for at least 12 months, and from stores which have been temporarily relocated for renovations. Comparable store sales also exclude sales from direct to consumer, outlets, showrooms, temporary locations, wholesale accounts, warehouse sales, license and supply arrangements, and sales from company-operated stores that we have closed.Total comparable sales combines comparable store sales and direct to consumer sales. We are evolving towards an omni-channel approach to support the shopping behavior of our guests. This involves country and region specific websites, mobile/tablet devices in stores, social networks, product notification emails, and online order fulfillment through stores. We therefore believe that reporting total comparable sales with comparable store sales and direct to consumer sales combined provides a relevant performance metric. Various factors affect comparable sales, including:•the location of new stores relative to existing stores;•consumer preferences, buying trends, and overall economic trends;•our ability to anticipate and respond effectively to customer preferences for technical athletic apparel;•competition;•changes in our merchandise mix;•pricing;•the timing of our releases of new merchandise and promotional events;•the effectiveness of our grassroots marketing efforts;•the design and ease of use of our websites; •the level of customer service that we provide in our stores and on our websites;•our ability to source and distribute products efficiently; and•the number of stores we open, close (including for temporary renovations), and expand in any period.Opening new stores is an important part of our growth strategy. Accordingly, total comparable sales has limited utility for assessing the success of our growth strategy insofar as comparable sales do not reflect the performance of stores open less than 12 months. The comparable sales measures we report may not be equivalent to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresConstant dollar changes in net revenue, total comparable sales, comparable store sales, and direct to consumer net revenue, and the effective tax rate and diluted earnings per share excluding certain tax and related interest adjustments, are non-GAAP financial measures.A constant dollar basis assumes the average foreign exchange rates for the period remained constant with the average foreign exchange rates for the same period of the prior year. We provide constant dollar changes in net revenue, total comparable sales, comparable store sales, and changes in direct to consumer net revenue because we use these measures to understand the underlying growth rate of net revenue excluding the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates. We believe 27Table of Contentsthat disclosing these measures on a constant dollar basis is useful to investors because it enables them to better understand the level of growth of our business.We disclose the effective tax rate and diluted earnings per share excluding certain tax and related interest adjustments because of their comparability to our historical information, which we believe is useful to investors.The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or with greater prominence to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures follows, which includes more detail on the GAAP financial measure that is most directly comparable to each non-GAAP financial measure, and the related reconciliations between these financial measures.The below changes in net revenue, total comparable sales, comparable store sales, and direct to consumer net revenue show the change compared to the corresponding period in the prior year.Constant dollar changes in net revenue, total comparable sales, comparable store sales, and direct to consumer net revenue Fiscal Year Ended January 29, 2017 Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2016 (In thousands) (Percentages) (In thousands) (Percentages)Change in net revenue $283,869 14% $263,310 15%Adjustments due to foreign exchange rate changes 8,983 — 88,877 5Change in net revenue in constant dollars $292,852 14% $352,187 20% Fiscal Year Ended January 29, 2017 January 31, 2016Change in total comparable sales1,2 6% 5%Adjustments due to foreign exchange rate changes 1 5Change in total comparable sales in constant dollars1,2 7% 10% Fiscal Year Ended January 29, 2017 Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2016 (In thousands) (Percentages) (In thousands) (Percentages)Change in comparable store sales2 $61,341 4% $(7,335) —%Adjustments due to foreign exchange rate changes 5,036 1 56,106 4Change in comparable store sales in constant dollars2 $66,377 5% $48,771 4% Fiscal Year Ended January 29, 2017 January 31, 2016Change in direct to consumer net revenue 13% 25%Adjustments due to foreign exchange rate changes — 5Change in direct to consumer net revenue in constant dollars 13% 30%__________1Total comparable sales includes comparable store sales and direct to consumer sales. 2Comparable store sales reflects net revenue from company-operated stores that have been open for at least 12 months, or open for at least 12 months after being significantly expanded.28Table of ContentsEffective tax rate and diluted earnings per share, excluding tax and related interest adjustments Fiscal Year Ended January 29, 2017 January 31, 2016 February 1, 2015Effective tax rate 28.2% 27.8% 37.6 %Tax and related interest adjustments1 2.5 1.7 (8.8)Effective tax rate, excluding tax and related interest adjustments 30.7% 29.5% 28.8 % Fiscal Year Ended January 29, 2017 January 31, 2016 February 1, 2015Diluted earnings per share $2.21 $1.89 $1.66Tax and related interest adjustments1 (0.07) (0.03) 0.23Diluted earnings per share, excluding tax and related interest adjustments $2.14 $1.86 $1.89_________1Please refer to Note 15 to the audited consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this report for an explanation as to the nature of these items.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesOur primary sources of liquidity are our current balances of cash and cash equivalents, cash flows from operations, and capacity under our revolving credit facility. Our primary cash needs are capital expenditures for opening new stores and remodeling or relocating existing stores, making information technology system enhancements, funding working capital requirements, and making other strategic capital investments both in North America and internationally. We may also use cash to repurchase shares of our common stock. Cash and cash equivalents in excess of our needs are held in interest bearing accounts with financial institutions.As of January 29, 2017, our working capital (excluding cash and cash equivalents) was $186.4 million, our cash and cash equivalents were $734.8 million and our capacity under our revolving credit facility was $149.2 million.The following table summarizes our net cash flows provided by and used in operating, investing and financing activities for the periods indicated: Fiscal Year Ended January 29, 2017 January 31, 2016 February 1, 2015 (In thousands)Total cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $385,119 $298,740 $314,449Investing activities (149,511) (143,487) (119,733)Financing activities (25,338) (273,693) (149,077)Effect of exchange rate changes 23,094 (44,557) (79,809)Increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $233,364 $(162,997) $(34,170)Operating ActivitiesCash flows provided by operating activities consist primarily of net income adjusted for certain items not affecting cash and the effect of changes in operating assets and liabilities.In fiscal 2016, cash provided by operating activities increased $86.4 million, to $385.1 million compared to cash provided by operating activities of $298.7 million in fiscal 2015. The increase was primarily a result of a decrease in inventory purchases, a decrease in the change in prepaid and receivable income taxes, and an increase in net income. This was partially offset by a decrease in the change in income taxes payable, deferred income taxes, and accrued inventory liabilities. Inventory purchases decreased during fiscal 2016 primarily as a result of actions taken to align inventory levels with forward sales trends.29Table of ContentsIn fiscal 2015, cash provided by operating activities decreased $15.7 million, to $298.7 million compared to cash provided by operating activities of $314.4 million in fiscal 2014. The decrease was primarily a result of an increase in inventory purchases and an increase in prepaid and receivable income taxes. This was partially offset by an increase in net income, changes in other operating assets and liabilities, and the change in items not affecting cash. The change in items not affecting cash was primarily due to an increase in depreciation related to our increased number of stores and a reduction in net deferred income tax assets.Inventory increased during fiscal 2015 primarily due to the opening of new stores, increased inventory levels to support the sales growth in our company-operated stores and direct to consumer segments, and the timing of product deliveries. Prepaid and receivable income taxes increased during fiscal 2015 primarily as a result of certain tax adjustments as outlined in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this report. These adjustments resulted in an income tax receivable in the United States and an increase in income taxes payable in Canada.Investing ActivitiesCash flows used in investing activities relate entirely to capital expenditures. Cash used in investing activities increased $6.0 million, to $149.5 million in fiscal 2016 from $143.5 million in fiscal 2015. Cash used in investing activities increased $23.8 million, to $143.5 million in fiscal 2015 from $119.7 million in fiscal 2014.Capital expenditures for our company-operated stores segment were $75.3 million in fiscal 2016 which included $30.6 million to open 46 company-operated stores, $85.8 million in fiscal 2015 which included $49.2 million to open 62 company-operated stores, and $76.9 million in fiscal 2014 which included $38.1 million to open 49 new company-operated stores. The remaining capital expenditures for our company-operated stores segment in each period were primarily for the remodeling or relocation of certain stores, and ongoing store refurbishment.Capital expenditures for our direct to consumer segment were $11.5 million, $8.3 million, and $10.0 million in fiscal 2016, fiscal 2015, and fiscal 2014, respectively. The capital expenditures for our direct to consumer segment in fiscal 2016 were primarily related to our global website redesign as well as mobile website enhancements, and in fiscal 2015 and 2014 were primarily related to website enhancements and country and region specific website launches.Capital expenditures related to corporate activities and other were $62.7 million, $49.4 million, and $32.9 million in fiscal 2016, fiscal 2015, and fiscal 2014, respectively. During the second quarter of fiscal 2016, we purchased a land parcel in Vancouver, BC for general corporate purposes for $19.7 million. The capital expenditures in each period for corporate activities and other were for investments in information technology and business systems, improvements at our head office and other corporate buildings, and for capital expenditures related to opening retail locations other than company-operated stores.Capital expenditures are expected to range between $170 million and $175 million in fiscal 2017.Financing ActivitiesCash flows used in or provided by financing activities consist primarily of cash used to repurchase shares of our common stock and certain cash flows related to stock-based compensation. Cash used in financing activities decreased $248.4 million, to $25.3 million in fiscal 2016 from $273.7 million in fiscal 2015. Cash used in financing activities increased $124.6 million, to $273.7 million in fiscal 2015 from $149.1 million in fiscal 2014. The primary cause of these changes in cash used in financing activities was our stock repurchase program. On June 11, 2014, our board of directors approved a program to repurchase shares of our common stock up to an aggregate value of $450.0 million. This stock repurchase program was completed during the second quarter of fiscal 2016. On December 1, 2016, our board of directors approved a program to repurchase shares of our common stock up to an aggregate value of $100.0 million. During the fiscal years ended January 29, 2017, January 31, 2016, and February 1, 2015, 0.5 million, 5.0 million, and 3.7 million shares, respectively, were repurchased under the programs at a total cost of $29.3 million, $274.2 million, and $147.4 million, respectively. We believe that our cash and cash equivalent balances, cash generated from operations, and borrowings available to us under our revolving credit facility will be adequate to meet our liquidity needs and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months. Our cash from operations may be negatively impacted by a decrease in demand for our products as well as the other factors described in ""Item 1A. Risk Factors"". In addition, we may make discretionary capital improvements with respect to our stores, distribution facilities, headquarters, or systems, which we would expect to fund through the use of cash, issuance of debt or equity securities or other external financing sources to the extent we were unable to fund such capital expenditures out of our cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from operations.30Table of ContentsRevolving Credit FacilityOn December 15, 2016, we entered into a credit agreement for $150.0 million under an unsecured five-year revolving credit facility. Bank of America, N.A., is administrative agent and HSBC Bank Canada is the syndication agent and letter of credit issuer, and the lenders party thereto. Borrowings under the revolving credit facility may be made, in U.S. Dollars, Euros, Canadian Dollars, and in other currencies, subject to the approval of the administrative agent and the lenders. Up to $35.0 million of the revolving credit facility is available for the issuance of letters of credit and up to $25.0 million is available for the issuance of swing line loans. Commitments under the revolving credit facility may be increased by up to $200.0 million, subject to certain conditions, including the approval of the lenders. Borrowings under the agreement may be prepaid and commitments may be reduced or terminated without premium or penalty (other than customary breakage costs). The principal amount outstanding under the credit agreement will be due and payable in full on December 15, 2021, subject to provisions that permit us to request a limited number of one year extensions annually. Borrowings made under the revolving credit facility bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at our option, either (a) a rate based on the rates applicable for deposits on the interbank market for U.S. Dollars or the applicable currency in which the borrowings are made (""LIBOR"") or (b) an alternate base rate, plus, in each case, an applicable margin. The applicable margin is determined by reference to a pricing grid, based on the ratio of indebtedness to earnings before interest, tax depreciation, amortization and rent (""EBITDAR"") and ranges between 1.00%-1.75% for LIBOR loans and 0.00%-0.75% for alternate base rate loans. Additionally, a commitment fee of between 0.125%-0.200%, also determined by reference to the pricing grid, is payable on the average daily unused amounts under the revolving credit facility.The credit agreement contains negative covenants that, among other things and subject to certain exceptions, limit the ability of our subsidiaries to incur indebtedness, incur liens, undergo fundamental changes, make dispositions of all or substantially all of their assets, alter their businesses and enter into agreements limiting subsidiary dividends and distributions. We are also required to maintain a consolidated rent-adjusted leverage ratio of not greater than 3.50:1.00 and we are not permitted to allow the ratio of consolidated EBITDAR to consolidated interest charges (plus rent) to be less than 2.00:1.00. The credit agreement also contains certain customary representations, warranties, affirmative covenants, and events of default (including, among others, an event of default upon the occurrence of a change of control). If an event of default occurs, the credit agreement may be terminated and the maturity of any outstanding amounts may be accelerated.As of January 29, 2017, aside from letters of credit of $0.8 million, we had no other borrowings outstanding under this credit facility.Contractual Obligations and CommitmentsLeases. We lease certain store and other retail locations, distribution centers, offices, and equipment under non-cancelable operating leases. Our leases generally have initial terms of between five and 10 years, and generally can be extended only in five-year increments, if at all. Our leases expire at various dates between one and 15 years, excluding extensions at our option. A substantial number of our leases include renewal options and certain of our leases include rent escalation clauses, rent holidays and leasehold rental incentives, none of which are reflected in the table below. The majority of our leases for store premises also include contingent rental payments based on sales, the impact of which also are not reflected in the table below. Product Purchase Obligations. The amounts listed for product purchase obligations in the table below represent agreements (including open purchase orders) to purchase products in the ordinary course of business that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms. In some cases, prices are subject to change throughout the production process. The reported amounts exclude product purchase liabilities included in accounts payable and accrued inventory liabilities as of January 29, 2017.The following table summarizes our contractual arrangements as of January 29, 2017, and the timing and effect that such commitments are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods: Payments Due by Fiscal Year Total 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 Thereafter (In thousands)Operating leases (minimum rent) $518,613 $118,897 $106,496 $94,085 $71,973 $45,019 $82,143Product purchase obligations $176,312 $176,312 $— $— $— $— $—Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsWe enter into standby letters of credit to secure certain of our obligations, including leases, taxes and duties. As of January 29, 2017, letters of credit totaling $0.8 million had been issued.31Table of ContentsWe have not entered into any transactions, agreements or other contractual arrangements to which an entity unconsolidated with us is a party and under which we have (i) any obligation under a guarantee, (ii) any retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity that serves as credit, liquidity or market risk support to such entity, (iii) any obligation under derivative instruments that are indexed to our shares and classified as equity in our consolidated balance sheets, or (iv) any obligation arising out of a variable interest in any unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit support to us or engages in leasing, hedging or research and development services with us.Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions. Predicting future events is inherently an imprecise activity and, as such, requires the use of judgment. Actual results may vary from our estimates in amounts that may be material to the financial statements. An accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically, could materially impact our consolidated financial statements. We believe that the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements:Revenue Recognition. Net revenue is recognized net of sales taxes, discounts, and an estimated allowance for sales returns. Sales to customers through company-operated stores and other physical locations are recognized at the point of sale, net of an estimated allowance for sales returns. Direct to consumer sales are recognized once delivery has occurred and collection is reasonably assured, net of an estimated allowance for sales returns. Other net revenue includes outlet sales, showroom sales, sales from temporary locations, sales to wholesale accounts, warehouse sales, and license and supply arrangement net revenue, which consists of royalties as well as sales of our product to licensees. Revenue is recognized when these sales occur. Employee discounts are classified as a reduction of net revenue.Our estimated allowance for sales returns is a subjective critical estimate that has a direct impact on reported net revenue. This allowance is calculated based on a history of actual returns, estimated future returns and any significant future known or anticipated events. Consideration of these factors results in an estimated allowance for sales returns. Our standard terms for retail sales limit returns to approximately 14 days after the sale of the merchandise, however we accept returns after 14 days where the product fails to meet our guests' quality expectations.Revenue from our gift cards is recognized when tendered for payment, or upon redemption. Outstanding customer balances are included in ""Unredeemed gift card liability"" on the consolidated balance sheets. There are no expiration dates on our gift cards, and we do not charge any service fees that cause a decrement to customer balances.While we will continue to honor all gift cards presented for payment, we may determine the likelihood of redemption to be remote for certain card balances due to, among other things, long periods of inactivity. In these circumstances, to the extent we determine there is no requirement for remitting card balances to government agencies under unclaimed property laws, card balances may be recognized in the consolidated statements of operations in net revenue. The amount recognized is an estimate, based on historical customer redemption rates.Inventory. Inventory is valued at the lower of cost and market. We periodically review our inventories and make provisions as necessary to appropriately value goods that are obsolete, have quality issues, or are damaged. The amount of the provision is equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and its net realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand, selling prices, and market conditions. If changes in market conditions result in reductions in the estimated net realizable value of our inventory below our previous estimate, we would increase our reserve in the period in which we made such a determination. In addition, we provide for inventory shrinkage as a percentage of sales, based on historical trends from actual physical inventories. Inventory shrinkage estimates are made to reduce the inventory value for lost or stolen items. We perform physical inventory counts throughout the year and adjust the shrink provision accordingly. 32Table of ContentsProperty and Equipment. Property and equipment are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation. Buildings are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the expected useful life of the asset, which we estimate to be 20 years. Leasehold improvements are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the lesser of the length of the lease and the estimated useful life of the assets, up to a maximum of five years. All other property and equipment is depreciated using the declining balance method as follows: Furniture and fixtures 20%Computer hardware and software 20% - 30%Equipment and vehicles 30%Changes in circumstances (such as technological advances) can result in differences between the actual and estimated useful lives. In those cases where we determine that the useful life of a long-lived asset should be shortened, we increase depreciation expense over the remaining useful life to depreciate the asset's net book value to its estimated salvage value.Long-Lived Assets. Long-lived assets, including intangible assets with finite useful lives are evaluated for impairment when the occurrence of events or changes in circumstances indicates that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable as measured by comparing their net book value to the undiscounted estimated future cash flows generated by their use and eventual disposition. Impaired assets are recorded at fair value, determined principally by the present value of the estimated future cash flows expected from their use and eventual disposition. Income Taxes. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities, and for tax losses, tax credit carry forwards, and other tax attributes, using the enacted tax rates that are to be in effect when these differences are expected to reverse. Deferred income tax liabilities are provided for U.S. income taxes on the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries, unless those earnings can be distributed on a tax-free basis or if the earnings are indefinitely reinvested. We determine on a regular basis the amount of undistributed earnings that will be indefinitely reinvested in our non-U.S. operations. This assessment is based on the cash flow projections and operational and fiscal objectives of each of our U.S. and foreign subsidiaries. Such estimates are inherently imprecise since many assumptions used in the projections are subject to revision. The possibility exists that amounts determined to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the U.S. may ultimately be repatriated.U.S. income and foreign withholding taxes have not been provided on approximately $852.3 million of cumulative undistributed earnings of a Canadian subsidiary as of January 29, 2017. These earnings are indefinitely reinvested outside of the United States. Income taxes of approximately $38.4 million would be incurred if these earnings were repatriated to the United States.As of January 29, 2017, we had cash and cash equivalents of $559.5 million outside of the United States. We do not intend to repatriate these funds to the United States.We evaluate our tax filing positions and recognize the largest amount of tax benefit that is considered more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. This determination requires the use of significant judgment. Income tax expense is adjusted in the period in which an uncertain tax position is effectively settled, the statute of limitations expires, facts or circumstances change, tax laws change, or new information becomes available. Our tax positions include intercompany transfer pricing policies and the associated taxable income and deductions arising from intercompany charges between subsidiaries within the consolidated group. Although we believe that our intercompany transfer pricing policies and tax positions are reasonable, the final outcomes of tax audits or potential tax disputes may be materially different from that which is reflected in our income tax provisions and accruals.Goodwill and Intangible Assets. Intangible assets are recorded at cost. Reacquired franchise rights are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives of 10 years. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair market value of identifiable net assets acquired and is not amortized. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually or more frequently when an event or circumstance indicates that goodwill might be impaired. Goodwill impairment testing requires us to estimate the fair value of our reporting units. We generally base our measurement of the fair value on the present value of future cash flows. Our significant estimates in the discounted cash flows model include the discount rate and long-term rates of growth. We use our best estimates and judgment based on available evidence in conducting the impairment testing. Stock-Based Compensation. We account for stock-based compensation using the fair value method. The fair value of awards granted is estimated at the date of grant and is recognized as employee compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. For awards with service and/or performance conditions, the amount of compensation expense recognized is based on the number of awards that are expected to vest. 33Table of ContentsThe estimation of the number of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment, and to the extent actual results differ from our estimates, such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised. We consider several factors when estimating the number of awards which are expected to vest, including, future profit forecasts, types of awards, size of option holder group, and anticipated employee retention. Actual results may differ substantially from these estimates. The calculation of the grant-date fair value of stock options requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions, including, stock price volatility, and the expected life of the options. We evaluate and revise these estimates and assumptions as necessary, to reflect market conditions and our historical experience. The expected term of the options is based upon historical experience of similar awards, giving consideration to expectations of future employee behavior. Expected volatility is based upon the historical volatility of our common stock for the period corresponding with the expected term of the options. In the future, the expected volatility and expected term may change which could substantially change the grant-date fair value of future awards of stock options and, ultimately, the expense we record. Contingencies. In the ordinary course of business, we are involved in legal proceedings regarding contractual and employment relationships and a variety of other matters. We record contingent liabilities resulting from claims against us, when a loss is assessed to be probable and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable. Assessing probability of loss and estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors, including in some cases judgments about the potential actions of third-party claimants and courts. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKMarket risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates. Our market risk exposure is primarily a result of fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. We do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes.Foreign Currency Exchange Risk. The functional currency of our foreign subsidiaries is generally the applicable local currency. Our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars. Therefore, the net revenue, expenses, assets, and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries are translated from their functional currencies into U.S. dollars. Fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar affect the reported amounts of net revenue, expenses, assets, and liabilities. Foreign exchange differences which arise on translation of our foreign subsidiaries' balance sheets into U.S. dollars are recorded as a foreign currency translation adjustment in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss within stockholders' equity. We also have exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates associated with transactions which are undertaken by our subsidiaries in currencies other than their functional currency. Such transactions include intercompany transactions and inventory purchases denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the purchasing entity. As a result, we have been impacted by changes in exchange rates and may be impacted for the foreseeable future. The potential impact of currency fluctuation increases as our international expansion increases.We currently generate a significant portion of our net revenue and incur a significant portion of our expenses in Canada. We also hold a significant portion of our net assets in Canada. The reporting currency for our consolidated financial statements is the U.S. dollar. A weakening of the U.S. dollar against the Canadian dollar results in:•an increase in our net revenue upon translation of the sales made by our Canadian operations into U.S. dollars for the purposes of consolidation;•an increase in our selling, general and administrative expenses incurred by our Canadian operations upon translation into U.S. dollars for the purposes of consolidation; and•foreign exchange revaluation losses by our Canadian subsidiaries on U.S. dollar cash and receivables denominated in U.S. dollars. During fiscal 2016, the change in the relative value of the U.S. dollar against the Canadian dollar resulted in a $41.7 million reduction in accumulated other comprehensive loss within stockholders' equity. During fiscal 2015, the change in the relative value of the U.S. dollar against the Canadian dollar resulted in a $63.2 million increase in accumulated other comprehensive loss within stockholders' equity.A 10% appreciation in the relative value of the U.S. dollar against the Canadian dollar compared to the exchange rates in effect for fiscal 2016 would have resulted in additional income from operations of approximately $0.2 million in fiscal 2016. This assumes a consistent 10% appreciation in the U.S. dollar against the Canadian dollar throughout the fiscal year. The timing of changes in the relative value of the U.S. dollar combined with the seasonal nature of our business, can affect the magnitude of the impact that fluctuations in foreign exchange rates have on our income from operations.34Table of ContentsWe have not historically hedged foreign currency fluctuations. However, in the future, in an effort to mitigate these risks, we may at times enter into derivative financial instruments, although we have not historically done so. We do not, and do not intend to, engage in the practice of trading derivative securities for profit.Interest Rate Risk. Our revolving credit facility, which is described in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this report, provide us with available borrowings in an amount up to $150.0 million in the aggregate. Because our revolving credit facility bears interest at a variable rate, we will be exposed to market risks relating to changes in interest rates, if we have a meaningful outstanding balance. As of January 29, 2017, aside from letters of credit of $0.8 million, we had no other borrowings outstanding under this credit facility. We currently do not engage in any interest rate hedging activity and currently have no intention to do so. However, in the future, if we have a meaningful outstanding balance under our revolving facility, in an effort to mitigate losses associated with these risks, we may at times enter into derivative financial instruments, although we have not historically done so. These may take the form of forward contracts, option contracts, or interest rate swaps. We do not, and do not intend to, engage in the practice of trading derivative securities for profit.InflationInflationary factors such as increases in the cost of our product and overhead costs may adversely affect our operating results. Although we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations to date, a high rate of inflation in the future may have an adverse effect on our ability to maintain current levels of gross margin and selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenue if the selling prices of our products do not increase with these increased costs.35Table of Contents",2023-12-30 21:53:32.373215
1397187,LULU,lululemon athletica inc.,2018,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSOur fiscal year ends on the Sunday closest to January 31 of the following year, typically resulting in a 52 week year, but occasionally giving rise to an additional week, resulting in a 53 week year. Fiscal 2017, fiscal 2016, and fiscal 2015 were 52 week years. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements based on current expectations that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions, such as our plans, objectives, expectations, and intentions set forth in the ""Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements."" Our actual results and the timing of events may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth in the ""Item 1A. Risk Factors"" section and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.OverviewFiscal 2017 was a strong year for our company. New stores and new store formats, product innovations, and an enhanced e-commerce offering, combined with successful community and brand initiatives helped drive a 13% increase in net revenue. We had a 7% increase in total comparable sales.Our product design and development teams launched a number of new category innovations this year. For women, our newest fabric Everlux was created for high intensity, indoor workouts and the Enlite bra offers guests proprietary technology for running and high impact training. For men, we expanded our popular ABC pant franchise to include slim and jogger styles, and all of our men's fixed waist bottoms now feature our ABC construction. We look forward to delivering on a strong pipeline of innovation and product rollouts in fiscal 2018.During the year, we opened 46 net new lululemon branded company-operated stores, including 30 in North America, 14 in Asia Pacific, and two in Europe. Our multiple formats now include standard, co-located, local, and select flagship locations, which allow us to cater to our guests where they live, work, and sweat.As of January 28, 2018, we had 57 stores in Asia Pacific and 13 stores in Europe, including our European flagship on London's Regent Street which showcases the fullest expression of our brand to both local and travelling guests. We expanded in Germany in fiscal 2017 with a new location in Munich. In Asia, we opened nine new stores in China during fiscal 2017, in addition to growing our local e-commerce presence via Tmall, and opening company-operated stores in Japan.We relaunched our websites at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2017, improving the online experience through upgraded visuals, added video content, more intuitive navigation, enhanced storytelling, and the integration of ivivva. The sales performance of our e-commerce business, which accelerated throughout the year, culminated in a 44% increase in direct to consumer net revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. In fiscal 2018 we plan to continue to develop our omni-channel experience to serve guests wherever and however they choose to shop, including launching a WeChat store in China.Our grassroots approach to brand-building - locally led by stores and store associates, who we call educators - enables us to connect with and uniquely understand our guest. We hosted several events during the year, including our annual SeaWheeze half marathon in Vancouver, The Ghost Race in 15 cities in North America, the Sweatlife Festival in London, and Unroll China across multiple cities. We complemented our local efforts with our first global marketing campaign ""This Is Yoga"", followed by men's focused ""Strength To Be"" and finally, for holiday, ""Breathe It All In"".We look forward to continuing this strong momentum into fiscal 2018, focusing on our four key strategic growth pillars: Digital, Men's, North America, and International, underpinned by innovations in product, our distinctive brand and community approach, and our vertically-integrated model.Financial HighlightsThe summary below provides both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. In connection with the restructuring of our ivivva operations, we recognized pre-tax costs totaling $47.2 million in fiscal 2017, and a related income tax recovery of $12.7 million. We recognized a provisional income tax expense of $59.3 million in fiscal 2017 related to the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The adjusted financial measures exclude these items, and also exclude certain discrete items related to our transfer pricing arrangements and taxes on repatriation of foreign earnings which were recognized during the fiscal 2016.For the fiscal year ended January 28, 2018, compared to the fiscal year ended January 29, 2017:•Net revenue increased 13% to $2.6 billion. On a constant dollar basis, net revenue increased 12%.20Table of Contents•Total comparable sales, which includes comparable store sales and direct to consumer, increased 7%. On a constant dollar basis, total comparable sales increased 7%.–Comparable store sales increased 1%, or increased 1% on a constant dollar basis.–Direct to consumer net revenue increased 27%, or increased 27% on a constant dollar basis.•Gross profit increased 17% to $1.4 billion. Adjusted gross profit increased 17% to $1.4 billion.•Gross margin increased 160 basis points to 52.8%. Adjusted gross margin increased 190 basis points to 53.1%.•Income from operations increased 8% to $456.0 million. Adjusted income from operations increased 19% to $503.2 million.•Operating margin decreased 80 basis points to 17.2%. Adjusted operating margin increased 100 basis points to 19.0%.•Income tax expense increased 69% to $201.3 million. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2017 was 43.8% compared to 28.2% for fiscal 2016. The adjusted effective tax rate was 30.5% for fiscal 2017 compared to 30.7% for fiscal 2016.•Diluted earnings per share were $1.90 for fiscal 2017 compared to $2.21 in fiscal 2016. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $2.59 for fiscal 2017 compared to $2.14 for fiscal 2016.Refer to the non-GAAP reconciliation tables contained in the ""Non-GAAP Financial Measures"" section of this ""Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations"" for reconciliations between constant dollar changes in net revenue, total comparable sales, comparable store sales, and direct to consumer net revenue, and adjusted gross profit, gross margin, income from operations, operating margin, income tax expense, effective tax rates, and diluted earnings per share, and the most directly comparable measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.GeneralNet revenue is comprised of company-operated store sales, direct to consumer sales through www.lululemon.com, other country and region specific websites, and mobile apps, including mobile apps on in-store devices that allow demand to be fulfilled via our distribution centers, and other net revenue, which includes outlet sales, sales from temporary locations, sales to wholesale accounts, showroom sales, warehouse sales, and license and supply arrangement net revenue, which consists of royalties as well as sales of our products to licensees.Cost of goods sold includes the cost of purchased merchandise, including freight, duty, and nonrefundable taxes incurred in delivering the goods to our distribution centers. It also includes occupancy costs and depreciation expense for our company-operated store locations, all costs incurred in operating our distribution centers and production, design, distribution, and merchandise departments, hemming, shrink, and inventory provision expense. The primary drivers of the costs of individual products are the costs of raw materials and labor in the countries where we source our merchandise.Selling, general and administrative expenses consist of all operating costs not otherwise included in cost of goods sold or asset impairment and restructuring costs. We expect selling, general and administrative expenses to increase in fiscal 2018 as we incur additional operating expenses to support our store and direct to consumer growth, while also making strategic investments to support the long term growth of the business.Asset impairment and restructuring costs consist of the lease termination, impairment of property and equipment, employee related costs, and other restructuring costs recognized in connection with the restructuring of our ivivva operations. Income tax expense depends on the statutory tax rates in the countries where we sell our products and the proportion of taxable income earned in those jurisdictions. To the extent the relative proportion of taxable income in the jurisdictions fluctuates, or the tax legislation in the respective jurisdictions changes, so will our effective tax rate. We also anticipate that, in the future, we may start to sell our products through retail locations in countries in which we have not yet operated, in which case, we would become subject to taxation based on the foreign statutory rates in the countries where these sales take place and our effective tax rate could fluctuate accordingly.21Table of ContentsResults of OperationsThe following tables summarize key components of our results of operations for the periods indicated, both in dollars and as a percentage of net revenue: Fiscal Year Ended January 28, 2018 January 29, 2017 January 31, 2016 (In thousands)Net revenue $2,649,181 $2,344,392 $2,060,523Cost of goods sold 1,250,391 1,144,775 1,063,357Gross profit 1,398,790 1,199,617 997,166Selling, general and administrative expenses 904,264 778,465 628,090Asset impairment and restructuring costs 38,525 — —Income from operations 456,001 421,152 369,076Other income (expense), net 3,997 1,577 (581)Income before income tax expense 459,998 422,729 368,495Income tax expense 201,336 119,348 102,448Net income $258,662 $303,381 $266,047 Fiscal Year Ended January 28, 2018 January 29, 2017 January 31, 2016 (Percentages)Net revenue 100.0% 100.0% 100.0 %Cost of goods sold 47.2 48.8 51.6Gross profit 52.8 51.2 48.4Selling, general and administrative expenses 34.1 33.2 30.5Asset impairment and restructuring costs 1.5 — —Income from operations 17.2 18.0 17.9Other income (expense), net 0.2 — —Income before income tax expense 17.4 18.0 17.9Income tax expense 7.6 5.1 5.0Net income 9.8% 12.9% 12.9 %Comparison of Fiscal 2017 to Fiscal 2016 Net RevenueNet revenue increased $304.8 million, or 13%, to $2.6 billion in fiscal 2017 from $2.3 billion in fiscal 2016. On a constant dollar basis, assuming the average exchange rates in fiscal 2017 remained constant with the average exchange rates in fiscal 2016, net revenue increased $290.6 million, or 12%.The increase in net revenue was primarily due to net revenue generated by new company-operated stores as well as increased direct to consumer net revenue. Total comparable sales, which includes comparable store sales and direct to consumer, increased 7% in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016. Total comparable sales increased 7% on a constant dollar basis.22Table of ContentsOur net revenue on a segment basis for fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016 is summarized below. Net revenue is expressed in dollar amounts. The percentages are presented as a percentage of total net revenue. Fiscal Years Ended January 28, 2018 and January 29, 2017 2017 2016 2017 2016 (In thousands) (Percentages)Company-operated stores $1,837,065 $1,704,357 69.3% 72.7%Direct to consumer 577,590 453,287 21.8 19.3Other 234,526 186,748 8.9 8.0Net revenue $2,649,181 $2,344,392 100.0% 100.0%Company-Operated Stores. Net revenue from our company-operated stores segment increased $132.7 million, or 8%, to $1.8 billion in fiscal 2017 from $1.7 billion in fiscal 2016. The following contributed to the increase in net revenue from our company-operated stores segment:•Net revenue from company-operated stores we opened or significantly expanded subsequent to January 29, 2017, and are therefore not included in comparable store sales, increased net revenue by $146.5 million. During fiscal 2017 we opened 46 net new lululemon branded company-operated stores, including 30 stores in North America, 14 stores in Asia Pacific, and two stores in Europe.•A comparable store sales increase of 1% in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 resulted in a $12.8 million increase to net revenue. Comparable store sales increased 1%, or $5.4 million on a constant dollar basis. The increase in comparable store sales was primarily a result of improved conversion rates and increased dollar value per transaction. This was partially offset by a decrease in store traffic, due in part to shifting retail traffic trends from in-store to online.These increases in net revenue were partially offset by the closure of 48 of our ivivva branded company-operated stores as part of the restructuring of our ivivva operations. These closures reduced our fiscal 2017 net revenue from company-operated stores by $26.6 million compared to fiscal 2016.Direct to Consumer. Net revenue from our direct to consumer segment increased $124.3 million, or 27%, to $577.6 million in fiscal 2017 from $453.3 million in fiscal 2016. Direct to consumer net revenue increased 27% on a constant dollar basis. The increase in net revenue from our direct to consumer segment was primarily the result of increased traffic on our e-commerce websites, improved conversion rates, and increased dollar value per transaction. During the second quarter of fiscal 2017, we held online warehouse sales in the United States and Canada which generated net revenue of $12.3 million. We did not hold any online warehouse sales during fiscal 2016. Excluding the impact of the online warehouse sales, direct to consumer net revenue increased 25%. Other. Net revenue from our other segment increased $47.8 million, or 26%, to $234.5 million in fiscal 2017 from $186.7 million in fiscal 2016. This increase was primarily the result of an increase in the number of outlets, increased net revenue at existing outlets, and an increase in the number of temporary locations. The increase in net revenue from our other segment was partially offset by lower net revenue from showrooms, primarily due a decrease in the number of showrooms open during fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016.Gross ProfitGross profit increased $199.2 million, or 17%, to $1.4 billion in fiscal 2017 from $1.2 billion in fiscal 2016.Gross profit as a percentage of net revenue, or gross margin, increased 160 basis points, to 52.8% in fiscal 2017 from 51.2% in fiscal 2016. The increase in gross margin was primarily the result of:•an increase in product margin of 200 basis points which was primarily due to lower product costs and a favorable mix of higher margin product, partially offset by higher markdowns, and higher shrink and damages; and•a favorable impact of foreign exchange rates of 10 basis points.This was partially offset by an increase in fixed costs related to our product and supply chain departments of 20 basis points, and costs incurred in connection with the restructuring of our ivivva operations of 30 basis points.During fiscal 2017, as a result of the restructuring of our ivivva operations, we recognized costs totaling $8.7 million within costs of goods sold, as outlined in Note 13 to the audited consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II 23Table of Contentsof this report. Excluding these charges, adjusted gross profit increased 17.3% to $1.4 billion and adjusted gross margin increased 190 basis points to 53.1% compared to fiscal 2016.Selling, General and Administrative ExpensesSelling, general and administrative expenses increased $125.8 million, or 16%, to $904.3 million in fiscal 2017 from $778.5 million in fiscal 2016. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to:•an increase in costs related to our operating channels of $91.4 million, comprised of:–an increase in employee costs of $32.8 million primarily from a growth in labor hours and benefits, mainly associated with new company-operated stores and other new operating locations;–an increase in variable costs such as distribution costs and credit card fees of $16.4 million primarily as a result of increased net revenue; and–an increase in other costs of $42.2 million primarily due to an increase in digital marketing expenses, website related costs including photography costs, brand and community costs, information technology related costs, and other costs associated with our operating locations;•an increase in head office costs of $50.0 million, comprised of:–an increase in employee costs of $19.3 million primarily due to additional employees to support the growth in our business; and–an increase in other costs of $30.7 million primarily due to increases in information technology related costs, brand and community costs, and professional fees.The increase in selling, general, and administrative expenses was partially offset by an increase in net foreign exchange and derivative gains of $15.6 million. There were net foreign exchange and derivative gains of $7.3 million in fiscal 2017 compared to net foreign exchange losses of $8.3 million in fiscal 2016. The net foreign exchange gains and losses primarily relate to the revaluation of U.S. dollar denominated monetary assets and liabilities held by Canadian subsidiaries. During fiscal 2017, we began entering into forward currency contracts designed to economically hedge these foreign exchange revaluation gains and losses. We have not applied hedge accounting to these instruments and the change in fair value of these derivatives is recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses.As a percentage of net revenue, selling, general and administrative expenses increased 90 basis points, to 34.1% in fiscal 2017 from 33.2% in fiscal 2016.Asset Impairment and Restructuring CostsAs a result of the restructuring of our ivivva operations, we recognized asset impairment and restructuring costs of $38.5 million in fiscal 2017. This includes lease termination costs of $21.1 million, long-lived asset impairment charges of $11.6 million, employee related costs of $4.2 million, and other restructuring costs of $1.6 million. We did not have any asset impairment and restructuring costs in fiscal 2016. Please refer to Note 13 to the audited consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this report for further information on these adjustments.Income from OperationsIncome from operations increased $34.8 million, or 8%, to $456.0 million in fiscal 2017 from $421.2 million in fiscal 2016. Operating margin decreased 80 basis points to 17.2% compared to 18.0% in fiscal 2016.In connection with the restructuring of our ivivva operations, we recognized pre-tax costs totaling $47.2 million in fiscal 2017. This includes asset impairment and restructuring costs of $38.5 million and costs recognized in cost of goods sold totaling $8.7 million. Excluding these charges, adjusted income from operations increased 19% to $503.2 million and adjusted operating margin increased 100 basis points to 19.0%.On a segment basis, we determine income from operations without taking into account our general corporate expenses and the costs we incur in connection with the restructuring of our ivivva operations.24Table of ContentsIncome from operations before general corporate expenses and restructuring related costs for fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016 is summarized below and is expressed in dollar amounts. The percentages are presented as a percentage of net revenue of the respective operating segments. Fiscal Years Ended January 28, 2018 and January 29, 2017 2017 2016 2017 2016 (In thousands) (Percentages)Company-operated stores $464,321 $415,635 25.3% 24.4%Direct to consumer 231,295 186,178 40.0 41.1Other 35,580 22,312 15.2 11.9Income from operations before general corporate expenses 731,196 624,125 General corporate expenses 227,972 202,973 Restructuring and related costs 47,223 — Income from operations $456,001 $421,152 Company-Operated Stores. Income from operations from our company-operated stores segment increased $48.7 million, or 12%, to $464.3 million for fiscal 2017 from $415.6 million for fiscal 2016. The increase was primarily the result of an increase in gross profit of $89.4 million, which was primarily due to increased net revenue and higher gross margin. The increase in gross profit was partially offset by an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses, including increased store employee costs, increased brand and community costs, and increased operating expenses associated with higher net revenues and new stores. Income from operations as a percentage of company-operated stores net revenue increased by 90 basis points primarily due to increased gross margin, partially offset by deleverage of selling, general and administrative expenses.Direct to Consumer. Income from operations from our direct to consumer segment increased $45.1 million, or 24%, to $231.3 million in fiscal 2017 from $186.2 million in fiscal 2016. The increase was primarily the result of an increase in gross profit of $88.7 million, which was primarily due to increased net revenue and higher gross margin. The increase in gross profit was partially offset by an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses including higher digital marketing expenses, website related costs, and higher variable costs such as packaging, distribution and credit card fees as a result of higher net revenue. Income from operations as a percentage of direct to consumer net revenue has decreased by 110 basis points primarily due to deleverage of selling, general and administrative expenses, partially offset by an increase in gross margin.Other. Income from operations from our other segment increased $13.3 million, or 59%, to $35.6 million in fiscal 2017 from $22.3 million in fiscal 2016. The increase was primarily the result of increased gross profit of $29.8 million, which was primarily due to increased net revenue and higher gross margin. The increase in gross profit was partially offset by an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses, including increased employee costs, increased brand and community costs, and increased operating expenses associated with new locations and higher net revenues. Income from operations as a percentage of other net revenue increased 330 basis points primarily due to an increase in gross margin partially offset by deleverage of selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of other net revenue.General Corporate Expenses. General corporate expenses increased $25.0 million, or 12%, to $228.0 million in fiscal 2017 from $203.0 million in fiscal 2016. This increase was primarily due to increased head office employee costs, a global brand campaign, increases in other brand and community costs, professional fees, depreciation, and information technology related costs. These increases were partially offset by an increase in net foreign exchange and derivative gains of $15.6 million. There were net foreign exchange and derivative gains of $7.3 million in fiscal 2017 compared to net foreign exchange losses of $8.3 million in fiscal 2016. We expect general corporate expenses to continue to increase in future years as we grow our overall business and require increased efforts at our head office to support our company-operated stores, direct to consumer and other segments.Other Income (Expense), NetThere was net other income of $4.0 million in fiscal 2017 compared to $1.6 million in fiscal 2016. The increase was primarily due to increased net interest income in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016. The increase in net interest income was primarily due to a net interest expense of $1.7 million which was recorded in fiscal 2016 in relation to certain tax adjustments that are outlined in Note 14 to the audited consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this report, as well as interest earned on our increased cash and cash equivalents in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016.25Table of ContentsIncome Tax ExpenseIncome tax expense increased $82.0 million, or 69%, to $201.3 million in fiscal 2017 from $119.3 million in fiscal 2016. In fiscal 2017 we recorded certain discrete tax adjustments which resulted in a net $46.6 million increase in income tax expense. These adjustments related to the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and to the ivivva restructuring. In fiscal 2016 we recorded certain separate tax adjustments related to the Company's transfer pricing arrangements between Canada and the U.S. The adjustments in fiscal 2016 resulted in an income tax recovery of $10.7 million. On December 22, 2017, legislation commonly referred to as the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (""U.S. tax reform"") was enacted. The U.S. tax reform made significant changes to corporate income tax in the United States, including reducing the federal income tax rate from 35% to 21% and imposing a mandatory transition tax on accumulated foreign subsidiary earnings which have not previously been subject to U.S. income tax. As a result of these tax legislation changes we have recognized a provisional income tax expense of $58.9 million for the mandatory transition tax and we have remeasured our deferred income assets and liabilities, resulting in a provisional deferred income tax expense of $0.4 million. In fiscal 2017 we also recognized an income tax recovery of $12.7 million related to the tax effect of the costs recognized in connection with the ivivva restructuring.In fiscal 2016 we recognized an income tax recovery of $10.7 million as a result of the finalization of an Advance Pricing Arrangement with the Internal Revenue Service and the Canada Revenue Agency. This agreement determines the amount of income which is taxable in each respective jurisdiction, and the final terms of the arrangement resulted in an increased amount of income tax recoverable in the United States.Further information on the adjustments recognized in both fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016 is outlined in Notes 13 and 14 to the audited consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this report. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2017 was 43.8% compared to 28.2% for fiscal 2016. Our effective tax rate excluding the above tax and related interest adjustments was 30.5% for fiscal 2017 compared to 30.7% for fiscal 2016. The decrease in our adjusted effective tax rate was primarily due to the lower U.S. federal income tax rate which was effective January 1, 2018, a decrease in state taxes, and certain other adjustments.Net IncomeNet income decreased $44.7 million, or 15%, to $258.7 million in fiscal 2017 from $303.4 million in fiscal 2016. The decrease in net income in fiscal 2017 was primarily due to an increase of $125.8 million in selling, general and administrative expenses, an increase of $82.0 million in income tax expense, and asset impairment and restructuring costs of $38.5 million recognized in fiscal 2017, partially offset by a $199.2 million increase in gross profit and an increase in other income (expense), net of $2.4 million.Comparison of Fiscal 2016 to Fiscal 2015Net RevenueNet revenue increased $283.9 million, or 14%, to $2.3 billion in fiscal 2016 from $2.1 billion in fiscal 2015. On a constant dollar basis, assuming the average exchange rates in fiscal 2016 remained constant with the average exchange rates in fiscal 2015, net revenue increased $292.9 million, or 14%.Net revenue increased across all segments. The increase in net revenue was primarily due to the addition of 43 net new company-operated stores during fiscal 2016, as well as increased comparable store sales and the growth of our direct to consumer segment. Total comparable sales, which includes comparable store sales and direct to consumer, increased 6% in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015. Total comparable sales increased 7% on a constant dollar basis.Our net revenue on a segment basis for fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015 is summarized below. Net revenue is expressed in dollar amounts. The percentages are presented as a percentage of total net revenue. Fiscal Years Ended January 29, 2017 and January 31, 2016 2016 2015 2016 2015 (In thousands) (Percentages)Company-operated stores $1,704,357 $1,516,323 72.7% 73.6%Direct to consumer 453,287 401,525 19.3 19.5Other 186,748 142,675 8.0 6.9Net revenue $2,344,392 $2,060,523 100.0% 100.0%26Table of ContentsCompany-Operated Stores. Net revenue from our company-operated stores segment increased $188.0 million, or 12%, to $1.7 billion in fiscal 2016 from $1.5 billion in fiscal 2015. The following contributed to the increase in net revenue from our company-operated stores segment:•Net revenue from company-operated stores we opened or significantly expanded subsequent to January 31, 2016, and therefore not included in comparable store sales, contributed $126.7 million to the increase. During fiscal 2016 we opened 43 net new company-operated stores, including 31 stores in North America, eight stores in Asia Pacific, and four stores in Europe. •A comparable store sales increase of 4% in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 resulted in a $61.3 million increase to net revenue. Comparable store sales increased 5%, or $66.4 million on a constant dollar basis. The increase in comparable store sales was primarily as a result of increased dollar value per transaction and improved conversion rates.Direct to Consumer. Net revenue from our direct to consumer segment increased $51.8 million, or 13%, to $453.3 million in fiscal 2016 from $401.5 million in fiscal 2015. Direct to consumer net revenue increased 13% on a constant dollar basis. The increase in net revenue from our direct to consumer segment was primarily the result of increased traffic on our e-commerce websites, increased dollar value per transaction and improved conversion rates.Other. Net revenue from our other segment increased $44.1 million, or 31%, to $186.7 million in fiscal 2016 from $142.7 million in fiscal 2015. This increase was primarily the result of an increased number of outlets which were open for the full year in fiscal 2016, increased net revenue at other existing outlets, and an increase in the number of temporary locations.Gross ProfitGross profit increased $202.5 million, or 20%, to $1.2 billion in fiscal 2016 from $997.2 million in fiscal 2015. Gross profit as a percentage of net revenue, or gross margin, increased 280 basis points, to 51.2% in fiscal 2016 from 48.4% in fiscal 2015. The increase in gross margin was primarily the result of an increase in product margin of 330 basis points, primarily due to lower product costs, improved average retail prices, and lower costs related to our raw material commitments.The increase in gross margin was partially offset by an increase in expenses related to our product and supply chain departments of 20 basis points, an increase in occupancy costs and depreciation of 20 basis points, and an unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates of 10 basis points.Selling, General and Administrative ExpensesSelling, general and administrative expenses increased $150.4 million, or 24%, to $778.5 million in fiscal 2016 from $628.1 million in fiscal 2015. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was principally comprised of:•an increase in employee costs for our operating locations of $47.0 million, primarily from a growth in labor hours and bonuses, mainly associated with new company-operated stores;•an increase in head office employee costs of $35.4 million to support the growth in our business;•an increase in head office costs other than employee costs of $21.2 million primarily as a result of increased brand and community costs, increased depreciation, and increased information technology costs;•an increase in net foreign exchange losses of $20.3 million, primarily related to the revaluation of U.S. dollar cash and receivables held in Canadian subsidiaries. There were net foreign exchange losses of $8.3 million in fiscal 2016 compared to net foreign exchange gains of $12.0 million in fiscal 2015;•an increase in other costs of $18.5 million for our operating channels such as digital marketing expenses, repairs and maintenance costs, and increased depreciation; and•an increase in variable costs such as credit card fees and distribution costs of $8.1 million primarily as a result of increased sales.As a percentage of net revenue, selling, general and administrative expenses increased 270 basis points, to 33.2% in fiscal 2016 from 30.5% in fiscal 2015.27Table of ContentsIncome from OperationsIncome from operations increased $52.1 million, or 14%, to $421.2 million in fiscal 2016 from $369.1 million in fiscal 2015. The increase was a result of increased gross profit of $202.5 million, partially offset by increased selling, general and administrative costs of $150.4 million.On a segment basis, we determine income from operations without taking into account our general corporate expenses.Income from operations before general corporate expenses for fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015 is summarized below and is expressed in dollar amounts. The percentages are presented as a percentage of net revenue of the respective operating segments. Fiscal Years Ended January 29, 2017 and January 31, 2016 2016 2015 2016 2015 (In thousands) (Percentages)Company-operated stores $415,635 $346,802 24.4% 22.9%Direct to consumer 186,178 166,418 41.1 41.4Other 22,312 5,826 11.9 4.1Income from operations before general corporate expenses 624,125 519,046 General corporate expenses 202,973 149,970 Income from operations $421,152 $369,076 Company-Operated Stores. Income from operations from our company-operated stores segment increased $68.8 million, or 20%, to $415.6 million for fiscal 2016 from $346.8 million for fiscal 2015. The increase was primarily the result of an increase in gross profit of $132.8 million, which was primarily due to increased net revenue and higher gross margin. Net revenue increased as a result of new stores as well as increased comparable store sales, which was primarily a result of increased dollar value per transaction and improved conversion rates. This was partially offset by an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses, including increased store employee costs and increased operating expenses associated with new stores and increased net revenue at existing stores. Income from operations as a percentage of company-operated stores net revenue increased by 150 basis points primarily due to increased gross margin, partially offset by deleverage of selling, general and administrative expenses.Direct to Consumer. Income from operations from our direct to consumer segment increased $19.8 million, or 12%, to $186.2 million in fiscal 2016 from $166.4 million in fiscal 2015. The increase was primarily the result of increased gross profit of $43.2 million primarily due to increased net revenue resulting from an increase in traffic on our e-commerce websites, increased dollar value per transaction, and improved conversion rates. This was partially offset by an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses including higher digital marketing expenses and higher variable costs such as distribution costs and credit card fees as a result of increased net revenue. Income from operations as a percentage of direct to consumer net revenue has decreased by 30 basis points primarily due to deleverage of selling, general and administrative expenses, partially offset by an increase in gross margin.Other. Income from operations from our other segment increased $16.5 million, or 283%, to $22.3 million in fiscal 2016 from $5.8 million in fiscal 2015. The increase was primarily the result of increased gross profit of $26.4 million, partially offset by increased selling, general and administrative expenses primarily due to increased employee costs. Income from operations as a percentage of other net revenue increased by 780 basis points primarily due to an increase in gross margin and decreased selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of other net revenue. General Corporate Expenses. General corporate expenses increased $53.0 million, or 35%, to $203.0 million in fiscal 2016 from $150.0 million in fiscal 2015. This increase was primarily due to increased head office employee costs, brand and community costs, depreciation, and information technology costs. There was also a $20.3 million increase in foreign exchange losses. We expect general corporate expenses to continue to increase in future years as we grow our overall business and require increased efforts at our head office to support our company-operated stores, direct to consumer and other segments.Other Income (Expense), NetThere was net other income of $1.6 million in fiscal 2016 compared to net other expense of $0.6 million in fiscal 2015. This was primarily the result of a $1.8 million reduction in net interest expense related to certain tax adjustments that are outlined in Note 14 to the audited consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this report, as well as interest earned on our increased cash and cash equivalents in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015.28Table of ContentsIncome Tax ExpenseIncome tax expense increased $16.9 million, or 16%, to $119.3 million in fiscal 2016 from $102.4 million in fiscal 2015. Fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015 included certain tax adjustments which resulted in net income tax recoveries of $10.7 million and $7.4 million, respectively, as outlined in Note 14 to the audited consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this report. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2016 was 28.2% compared to 27.8% for fiscal 2015. Our effective tax rate excluding the above tax and related interest adjustments was 30.7% for fiscal 2016 compared to 29.5% for fiscal 2015.Net IncomeNet income increased $37.4 million, or 14%, to $303.4 million in fiscal 2016 from $266.0 million in fiscal 2015. The increase in net income in fiscal 2016 was primarily due to a $202.5 million increase in gross profit and an increase in other income (expense), net of $2.2 million, partially offset by an increase of $150.4 million in selling, general and administrative expenses and an increase of $16.9 million in income tax expense.Comparable SalesWe separately track comparable store sales, which reflect net revenue from company-operated stores that have been open for at least 12 months, or open for at least 12 months after being significantly expanded. Net revenue from a store is included in comparable store sales beginning with the first month for which the store has a full month of sales in the prior year. Comparable store sales exclude sales from new stores that have not been open for at least 12 months, from stores which have not been in their significantly expanded space for at least 12 months, and from stores which have been temporarily relocated for renovations. Comparable store sales also exclude sales from direct to consumer, outlets, temporary locations, wholesale accounts, showrooms, warehouse sales, license and supply arrangements, and sales from company-operated stores that we have closed.Total comparable sales combines comparable store sales and direct to consumer sales. We are evolving towards an omni-channel approach to support the shopping behavior of our guests. This involves country and region specific websites, mobile apps, including mobile apps on in-store devices that allow demand to be fulfilled via our distribution centers, social media, product notification emails, and online order fulfillment through stores. We therefore believe that reporting total comparable sales with comparable store sales and direct to consumer sales combined provides a relevant performance metric. Various factors affect comparable sales, including:•the location of new stores relative to existing stores;•consumer preferences, buying trends, and overall economic trends;•our ability to anticipate and respond effectively to customer preferences for technical athletic apparel;•competition;•changes in our merchandise mix;•pricing;•the timing of our releases of new merchandise and promotional events;•the effectiveness of our marketing efforts;•the design and ease of use of our websites and mobile apps; •the level of customer service that we provide in our stores and on our websites and mobile apps;•our ability to source and distribute products efficiently; and•the number of stores we open, close (including for temporary renovations), and expand in any period.Opening new stores is an important part of our growth strategy. Accordingly, total comparable sales has limited utility for assessing the success of our growth strategy insofar as comparable sales do not reflect the performance of stores open less than 12 months. The comparable sales measures we report may not be equivalent to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.29Table of ContentsNon-GAAP Financial MeasuresConstant dollar changes in net revenue, total comparable sales, comparable store sales, and direct to consumer net revenue, and the adjusted financial results are non-GAAP financial measures.A constant dollar basis assumes the average foreign exchange rates for the period remained constant with the average foreign exchange rates for the same period of the prior year. We provide constant dollar changes in net revenue, total comparable sales, comparable store sales, and direct to consumer net revenue because we use these measures to understand the underlying growth rate of net revenue excluding the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates. We believe that disclosing these measures on a constant dollar basis is useful to investors because it enables them to better understand the level of growth of our business.Adjusted gross profit, gross margin, income from operations, operating margin, income tax expense, effective tax rates, and diluted earnings per share exclude the costs recognized in connection with the restructuring of our ivivva operations and its related tax effects, the amounts recognized in connection with the U.S. tax reform, and certain discrete items related to our transfer pricing arrangements and taxes on repatriation of foreign earnings. We believe these adjusted financial measures are useful to investors as the adjustments do not directly relate to our ongoing business operations and therefore do not contribute to a meaningful evaluation of the trend in our operating performance. Furthermore, we do not believe the adjustments are reflective of our expectations of our future operating performance and believe these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors because of their comparability to our historical information.The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or with greater prominence to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures follows, which includes more detail on the GAAP financial measure that is most directly comparable to each non-GAAP financial measure, and the related reconciliations between these financial measures.The below changes in net revenue, total comparable sales, comparable store sales, and direct to consumer net revenue show the change compared to the corresponding period in the prior year.30Table of ContentsConstant dollar changes in net revenue, total comparable sales, comparable store sales, and direct to consumer net revenue Fiscal Year Ended January 28, 2018 Fiscal Year Ended January 29, 2017 (In thousands) (Percentages) (In thousands) (Percentages)Change in net revenue $304,789 13 % $283,869 14%Adjustments due to foreign exchange rate changes (14,221) (1) 8,983 —Change in net revenue in constant dollars $290,568 12 % $292,852 14% Fiscal Year Ended January 28, 2018 January 29, 2017Change in total comparable sales(1),(2) 7% 6%Adjustments due to foreign exchange rate changes — 1Change in total comparable sales in constant dollars(1),(2) 7% 7% Fiscal Year Ended January 28, 2018 Fiscal Year Ended January 29, 2017 (In thousands) (Percentages) (In thousands) (Percentages)Change in comparable store sales(2) $12,820 1% $61,341 4%Adjustments due to foreign exchange rate changes (7,395) — 5,036 1Change in comparable store sales in constant dollars(2) $5,425 1% $66,377 5% Fiscal Year Ended January 28, 2018 January 29, 2017Change in direct to consumer net revenue 27% 13%Adjustments due to foreign exchange rate changes — —Change in direct to consumer net revenue in constant dollars 27% 13%__________(1) Total comparable sales includes comparable store sales and direct to consumer sales.

Our primary cash needs are capital expenditures for opening new stores and remodeling or relocating existing stores, making information technology system enhancements, funding working capital requirements, and making other strategic capital investments both in North America and internationally. We may also use cash to repurchase shares of our common stock. Cash and cash equivalents in excess of our needs are held in interest bearing accounts with financial institutions.32Table of ContentsAs of January 28, 2018, our working capital (excluding cash and cash equivalents) was $153.2 million, our cash and cash equivalents were $990.5 million and our capacity under our revolving credit facility was $148.8 million.The following table summarizes our net cash flows provided by and used in operating, investing and financing activities for the periods indicated: Fiscal Year Ended January 28, 2018 January 29, 2017 January 31, 2016 (In thousands)Total cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $489,337 $386,392 $297,538Investing activities (173,392) (149,511) (143,487)Financing activities (97,862) (26,611) (272,491)Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 37,572 23,094 (44,557)Increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $255,655 $233,364 $(162,997)Operating ActivitiesCash flows provided by operating activities consist primarily of net income adjusted for certain items including depreciation and amortization, asset impairments costs relating to the restructuring of our ivivva operations, stock-based compensation expense, and the effect of changes in operating assets and liabilities.Net cash provided by operating activities increased $102.9 million in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016, primarily as a result of the following:Changes in operating assets and liabilities•an increase of $104.0 million in the change in operating assets and liabilities, primarily due to the following:–$62.5 million related to income taxes, primarily due to income taxes payable in relation to the U.S. tax reform;–$31.8 million related to other accrued and non-current liabilities, primarily due to changes in accrued operating expenses, forward currency contract liabilities, and tenant inducements.Net income and non-cash items•a decrease of $44.7 million in net income, partially offset by an increase of $43.6 million in non-cash expenses primarily related to asset impairment costs related to the restructuring of our ivivva operations, and an increase in depreciation.In fiscal 2016, cash provided by operating activities increased $88.9 million, to $386.4 million compared to cash provided by operating activities of $297.5 million in fiscal 2015. The increase was primarily a result of a decrease in inventory purchases, a decrease in the change in prepaid and receivable income taxes, and an increase in net income. This was partially offset by a decrease in the change in income taxes payable, deferred income taxes, and accrued inventory liabilities. Inventory purchases decreased during fiscal 2016 primarily as a result of actions taken to align inventory levels with forward sales trends.Investing ActivitiesCash flows used in investing activities relate to capital expenditures, the settlement of net investment hedges, and other investing activities. Cash used in investing activities increased $23.9 million, to $173.4 million in fiscal 2017 from $149.5 million in fiscal 2016. Cash used in investing activities increased $6.0 million, to $149.5 million in fiscal 2016 from $143.5 million in fiscal 2015.Capital expenditures for our company-operated stores segment were $80.2 million, $75.3 million, $85.8 million in fiscal 2017, fiscal 2016, and fiscal 2015, respectively. The capital expenditures for our company-operated stores segment in each period were primarily for the remodeling or relocation of certain stores, and ongoing store refurbishment. The capital expenditures for our company-operated stores segment also included $29.3 million to open 49 company-operated stores, $30.6 million to open 46 company-operated stores, and $49.2 million to open 62 new company-operated stores, in fiscal 2017, fiscal 2016, and fiscal 2015, respectively.Capital expenditures for our direct to consumer segment were $19.9 million, $11.5 million, and $8.3 million in fiscal 2017, fiscal 2016, and fiscal 2015, respectively. The capital expenditures for our direct to consumer segment were primarily related to our global and region specific websites as well as mobile apps. 33Table of ContentsCapital expenditures related to corporate activities and other were $57.7 million, $62.7 million, and $49.4 million in fiscal 2017, fiscal 2016, and fiscal 2015, respectively. The capital expenditures in each fiscal year were primarily related to investments in information technology and business systems, improvements at our head office and other corporate buildings, and for capital expenditures related to opening retail locations other than company-operated stores.In fiscal 2017 we redeveloped and relaunched our enhanced website. We also undertook various information technology infrastructure and corporate system initiatives and continued with the development of our new enterprise resource planning system that will help improve our merchandising, costing, allocation, and inventory platforms.The increase in corporate capital expenditures in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 was primarily related to a parcel of land that we purchased in Vancouver, BC for general corporate purposes for $19.7 million.Capital expenditures are expected to range between $240 million and $250 million in fiscal 2018.Financing ActivitiesCash flows used in or provided by financing activities consist primarily of cash used to repurchase shares of our common stock and certain cash flows related to stock-based compensation. Cash used in financing activities increased $71.3 million, to $97.9 million in fiscal 2017 from $26.6 million in fiscal 2016. Cash used in financing activities decreased $245.9 million, to $26.6 million in fiscal 2016 from $272.5 million in fiscal 2015. The primary cause of these changes in cash used in financing activities was our stock repurchase programs. On June 11, 2014, our board of directors approved a program to repurchase shares of our common stock up to an aggregate value of $450.0 million. This stock repurchase program was completed during the second quarter of fiscal 2016. On December 1, 2016, our board of directors approved a program to repurchase shares of our common stock up to an aggregate value of $100.0 million. This stock repurchase program was completed during the third quarter of fiscal 2017. On November 29, 2017, our board of directors approved a program to repurchase shares of our common stock up to an aggregate value of $200.0 million.During the fiscal years ended January 28, 2018, January 29, 2017, and January 31, 2016, 1.9 million, 0.5 million, and 5.0 million shares, respectively, were repurchased under the programs at a total cost of $100.3 million, $29.3 million, and $274.2 million, respectively. The common stock was repurchased in the open market at prevailing market prices, including under plans complying with the provisions of Rule 10b5-1 and Rule 10b-18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, with the timing and actual number of shares repurchased depending upon market conditions, eligibility to trade, and other factors.We believe that our cash and cash equivalent balances, cash generated from operations, and borrowings available to us under our revolving credit facility will be adequate to meet our liquidity needs and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months. Our cash from operations may be negatively impacted by a decrease in demand for our products as well as the other factors described in ""Item 1A. Risk Factors"". In addition, we may make discretionary capital improvements with respect to our stores, distribution facilities, headquarters, or systems, or we may repurchase shares under an approved stock repurchase program, which we would expect to fund through the use of cash, issuance of debt or equity securities or other external financing sources to the extent we were unable to fund such capital expenditures out of our cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from operations.Revolving Credit FacilityOn December 15, 2016, we entered into a credit agreement for $150.0 million under an unsecured five-year revolving credit facility. Bank of America, N.A., is administrative agent and HSBC Bank Canada is the syndication agent and letter of credit issuer, and the lenders party thereto. Borrowings under the revolving credit facility may be made, in U.S. Dollars, Euros, Canadian Dollars, and in other currencies, subject to the approval of the administrative agent and the lenders. Up to $35.0 million of the revolving credit facility is available for the issuance of letters of credit and up to $25.0 million is available for the issuance of swing line loans. Commitments under the revolving credit facility may be increased by up to $200.0 million, subject to certain conditions, including the approval of the lenders. Borrowings under the agreement may be prepaid and commitments may be reduced or terminated without premium or penalty (other than customary breakage costs). The principal amount outstanding under the credit agreement, if any, will be due and payable in full on December 15, 2021, subject to provisions that permit us to request a limited number of one year extensions annually. Borrowings made under the revolving credit facility bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at our option, either (a) a rate based on the rates applicable for deposits on the interbank market for U.S. Dollars or the applicable currency in which the borrowings are made (""LIBOR"") or (b) an alternate base rate, plus, in each case, an applicable margin. The applicable margin is determined by reference to a pricing grid, based on the ratio of indebtedness to earnings before interest, tax depreciation, amortization and rent (""EBITDAR"") and ranges between 1.00%-1.75% for LIBOR loans and 0.00%-0.75% for alternate base 34Table of Contentsrate loans. Additionally, a commitment fee of between 0.125%-0.200%, also determined by reference to the pricing grid, is payable on the average daily unused amounts under the revolving credit facility.The credit agreement contains negative covenants that, among other things and subject to certain exceptions, limit the ability of our subsidiaries to incur indebtedness, incur liens, undergo fundamental changes, make dispositions of all or substantially all of their assets, alter their businesses and enter into agreements limiting subsidiary dividends and distributions. We are also required to maintain a consolidated rent-adjusted leverage ratio of not greater than 3.50:1.00 and we are not permitted to allow the ratio of consolidated EBITDAR to consolidated interest charges (plus rent) to be less than 2.00:1.00. The credit agreement also contains certain customary representations, warranties, affirmative covenants, and events of default (including, among others, an event of default upon the occurrence of a change of control). If an event of default occurs, the credit agreement may be terminated and the maturity of any outstanding amounts may be accelerated.As of January 28, 2018, aside from letters of credit of $1.2 million, we had no other borrowings outstanding under this credit facility.Contractual Obligations and CommitmentsLeases. We lease certain store and other retail locations, distribution centers, offices, and equipment under non-cancelable operating leases. Our leases generally have initial terms of between five and 10 years, and generally can be extended in five-year increments, if at all. A substantial number of our leases include renewal options and certain of our leases include rent escalation clauses, rent holidays and leasehold rental incentives, none of which are reflected in the table below. The majority of our leases for store premises also include contingent rental payments based on sales, the impact of which also are not reflected in the table below. Product purchase obligations. The amounts listed for product purchase obligations in the table below represent agreements (including open purchase orders) to purchase products in the ordinary course of business that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms. In some cases, prices are subject to change throughout the production process. The reported amounts exclude product purchase liabilities included in accounts payable and accrued inventory liabilities as of January 28, 2018.One-time transition tax. As outlined in Note 14 to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this report, the U.S. tax reform imposed a mandatory transition tax on accumulated foreign subsidiary earnings which have not previously been subject to U.S. income tax. The one-time transition tax is payable over eight years. We recognized a provisional income tax expense of $58.9 million in fiscal 2017 for the mandatory transition tax. The one-time transition tax payable is net of foreign tax credits, and the table below outlines the expected payments due by fiscal year.The following table summarizes our contractual arrangements as of January 28, 2018, and the timing and effect that such commitments are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods: Payments Due by Fiscal Year Total 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 Thereafter (In thousands)Operating leases (minimum rent) $611,817 $143,428 $127,641 $105,720 $81,595 $59,058 $94,375Product purchase obligations 159,679 159,679 — — — — —One-time transition tax payable 56,969 8,701 4,197 4,197 4,197 4,197 31,480Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsWe enter into standby letters of credit to secure certain of our obligations, including leases, taxes and duties. As of January 28, 2018, letters of credit totaling $1.2 million had been issued.We have not entered into any transactions, agreements or other contractual arrangements to which an entity unconsolidated with us is a party and under which we have (i) any obligation under a guarantee, (ii) any retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity that serves as credit, liquidity or market risk support to such entity, (iii) any obligation under derivative instruments that are indexed to our shares and classified as equity in our consolidated balance sheets, or (iv) any obligation arising out of a variable interest in any unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit support to us or engages in leasing, hedging or research and development services with us.35Table of ContentsCritical Accounting Policies and EstimatesThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions. Predicting future events is inherently an imprecise activity and, as such, requires the use of judgment. Actual results may vary from our estimates in amounts that may be material to the financial statements. An accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically, could materially impact our consolidated financial statements. We believe that the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements:Revenue Recognition. Net revenue is recognized net of sales taxes, discounts, and an estimated allowance for sales returns. Sales to customers through company-operated stores and other retail locations are recognized at the point of sale, net of an estimated allowance for sales returns. Direct to consumer sales are recognized once delivery has occurred and collection is reasonably assured, net of an estimated allowance for sales returns. Other net revenue includes outlet sales, sales from temporary locations, sales to wholesale accounts, showroom sales, warehouse sales, and license and supply arrangement net revenue, which consists of royalties as well as sales of our product to licensees. Revenue is recognized when these sales occur. Employee discounts are classified as a reduction of net revenue.Our estimated allowance for sales returns is a subjective critical estimate that has a direct impact on reported net revenue. This allowance is calculated based on a history of actual returns, estimated future returns and any significant future known or anticipated events. Consideration of these factors results in an estimated allowance for sales returns. Our standard terms for retail sales limit returns to approximately 30 days after the sale of the merchandise, however we accept returns after 30 days where the product fails to meet our guests' quality expectations.Revenue from our gift cards is recognized when tendered for payment. Outstanding customer balances are included in ""Unredeemed gift card liability"" on the consolidated balance sheets. There are no expiration dates on our gift cards, and we do not charge any service fees that cause a decrement to customer balances.While we will continue to honor all gift cards presented for payment, we may determine the likelihood of redemption to be remote for certain card balances due to, among other things, long periods of inactivity. In these circumstances, to the extent we determine there is no requirement for remitting card balances to government agencies under unclaimed property laws, the portion of card balances not expected to be redeemed are recognized in net revenue in proportion to the gift cards which have been redeemed.Inventory. Inventory is valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value. We periodically review our inventories and make provisions as necessary to appropriately value goods that are obsolete, have quality issues, or are damaged. The amount of the provision is equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and its net realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand, selling prices, and market conditions. If changes in market conditions result in reductions in the estimated net realizable value of our inventory below our previous estimate, we would increase our reserve in the period in which we made such a determination. In addition, we provide for inventory shrinkage as a percentage of sales, based on historical trends from actual physical inventories. Inventory shrinkage estimates are made to reduce the inventory value for lost or stolen items. We perform physical inventory counts and cycle counts throughout the year and adjust the shrink provision accordingly. Property and Equipment. Property and equipment are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation. Buildings are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the expected useful life of the asset, which is individually assessed, and estimated to be up to 20 years. Leasehold improvements are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the lesser of the length of the lease and the estimated useful life of the assets, up to a maximum of five years. All other property and equipment is depreciated using the declining balance method as follows: Furniture and fixtures 20%Computer hardware and software 20% - 30%Equipment and vehicles 30%Changes in circumstances, such as technological advances, can result in differences between the actual and estimated useful lives. In those cases where we determine that the useful life of a long-lived asset should be shortened, we increase depreciation expense over the remaining useful life to depreciate the asset's net book value to its estimated salvage value.36Table of ContentsLong-Lived Assets. Long-lived assets, including intangible assets with finite useful lives are evaluated for impairment when the occurrence of events or changes in circumstances indicates that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable as measured by comparing their net book value to the undiscounted estimated future cash flows generated by their use and eventual disposition. Impaired assets are recorded at fair value, determined principally by the present value of the estimated future cash flows expected from their use and eventual disposition. Income Taxes. The U.S. tax reform enacted on December 22, 2017 introduces significant changes to the U.S. income tax laws. The accounting for the income tax effects of the U.S. tax reform is complex and requires significant judgement and estimates in the interpretation and calculations of its provisions.We have recognized a provisional amount of $59.3 million in income tax expense in fiscal 2017 in relation to the U.S. tax reform. This includes a provisional current income tax expense of $58.9 million for the mandatory one-time transition tax on the deemed repatriation of accumulated undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries, and a provisional deferred income tax expense of $0.4 million to reflect the reduced U.S. tax rate and other effects of the U.S. tax reform.Further analysis will be required with respect to the method of computation and components of the foreign subsidiaries' earnings and profits, the definition of foreign cash positions, the computation and limitation of the use of foreign tax credits, the conformity of each state to the U.S. federal income tax laws on the mandatory deemed repatriation income inclusion for state income tax purposes, the impact that the U.S. tax reform has, if any, upon our reinvestment plans for the accumulated earnings of the Company's foreign subsidiaries, and the amount of tax that would apply in the event of any change in our reinvestment plans. We may make adjustments to the provisional amounts and those adjustments may materially impact our provision for income taxes and effective income tax rates in the period in which the adjustments are made, and in future periods. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities, and for tax losses, tax credit carryforwards, and other tax attributes, using the enacted tax rates that are to be in effect when these differences are expected to reverse. Our deferred income tax balances and income tax rates are significantly affected by the tax rates on our global operations and the extent to which the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries are indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. Deferred income tax liabilities are recognized for U.S. federal and state income taxes and foreign withholding taxes on the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries, unless those earnings are indefinitely reinvested outside of the U.S. Indefinite reinvestment is determined by management's judgment about, and intentions concerning, the future operations of the Company. As of January 28, 2018, we have not changed our indefinite reinvestment plans as a result of the U.S. tax reform. Accordingly, no deferred income tax liabilities have been recognized on any of the undistributed earnings of the Company's foreign subsidiaries. We are continuing to evaluate the impact that the U.S. tax reform has upon the taxes which may become payable upon repatriation, our reinvestment plans, and the most efficient means of deploying our capital resources globally. As this analysis has not yet been completed, it is possible that amounts determined to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the U.S. may ultimately be repatriated, resulting in additional tax liabilities being recognized.The cumulative undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries as of January 28, 2018 were $1.24 billion, including $1.21 billion of accumulated undistributed earnings of a Canadian subsidiary. In the event we determine that all or a portion of such Canadian earnings will no longer be indefinitely reinvested outside of the United States, Canadian withholding taxes of 5% and U.S. state income taxes could apply to some portion of any distribution made. This is in addition to the one-time transition tax that is payable as a result of the U.S. tax reform. The amount of tax that would be payable upon repatriation is dependent on the elections available to us under Canadian withholding tax legislation, the extent to which such withholding tax would be recoverable through U.S. foreign tax credits, and the interaction between state and U.S. federal income tax laws as a result of the U.S. tax reform.We evaluate our tax filing positions and recognize the largest amount of tax benefit that is considered more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. This determination requires the use of significant judgment. Income tax expense is adjusted in the period in which an uncertain tax position is effectively settled, the statute of limitations expires, facts or circumstances change, tax laws change, or new information becomes available. Our tax positions include intercompany transfer pricing policies and the associated taxable income and deductions arising from intercompany charges between subsidiaries within the consolidated group. Although we believe that our intercompany transfer pricing policies and tax positions are reasonable, the final outcomes of tax audits or potential tax disputes may be materially different from that which is reflected in our income tax provisions and accruals.Goodwill and Intangible Assets. Intangible assets are recorded at cost. Reacquired franchise rights are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives of 10 years. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair market value of identifiable net assets acquired and is not amortized. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually or more frequently when an event or circumstance indicates that goodwill might be impaired. Goodwill impairment testing requires us 37Table of Contentsto estimate the fair value of our reporting units. We generally base our measurement of the fair value on the present value of future cash flows. Our significant estimates in the discounted cash flows model include the discount rate and long-term rates of growth. We use our best estimates and judgment based on available evidence in conducting the impairment testing. Stock-Based Compensation. We account for stock-based compensation using the fair value method. The fair value of awards granted is estimated at the date of grant and is recognized as employee compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. For awards with service and/or performance conditions, the amount of compensation expense recognized is based on the number of awards that are expected to vest. The estimation of the number of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment, and to the extent actual results differ from our estimates, such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised. We consider several factors when estimating the number of awards which are expected to vest, including, future profit forecasts, types of awards, size of option holder group, and anticipated employee retention and estimated expected forfeitures. Actual results may differ substantially from these estimates.The calculation of the grant-date fair value of stock options requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions, including, stock price volatility, and the expected life of the options. We evaluate and revise these estimates and assumptions as necessary, to reflect market conditions and our historical experience. The expected term of the options is based upon historical experience of similar awards, giving consideration to expectations of future employee behavior. Expected volatility is based upon the historical volatility of our common stock for the period corresponding with the expected term of the options. In the future, the expected volatility and expected term may change which could substantially change the grant-date fair value of future awards of stock options and, ultimately, the expense we record. Contingencies. In the ordinary course of business, we are involved in legal proceedings regarding contractual and employment relationships and a variety of other matters. We record contingent liabilities resulting from claims against us, when a loss is assessed to be probable and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable. Assessing probability of loss and estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors, including in some cases judgments about the potential actions of third-party claimants and courts. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKForeign Currency Exchange Risk. The functional currency of our foreign subsidiaries is generally the applicable local currency. Our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars. Therefore, the net revenue, expenses, assets, and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries are translated from their functional currencies into U.S. dollars. Fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar affect the reported amounts of net revenue, expenses, assets, and liabilities. Foreign exchange differences which arise on translation of our foreign subsidiaries' balance sheets into U.S. dollars are recorded as a foreign currency translation adjustment in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss within stockholders' equity. We also have exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates associated with transactions which are undertaken by our subsidiaries in currencies other than their functional currency. Such transactions include intercompany transactions and inventory purchases denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the purchasing entity. As a result, we have been impacted by changes in exchange rates and may be impacted for the foreseeable future. The potential impact of currency fluctuation increases as our international expansion increases.As of January 28, 2018, we had certain forward currency contracts outstanding in order to hedge a portion of the foreign currency exposure that arises on translation of a Canadian subsidiary into U.S. dollars. We also had certain forward currency contracts outstanding in an effort to reduce our exposure to the foreign exchange revaluation gains and losses that are recognized by our Canadian subsidiaries on U.S. dollar denominated monetary assets and liabilities. Please refer to Note 12 to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this report for further information, including details of the notional amounts outstanding.In the future, in an effort to reduce foreign exchange risks, we may enter into further derivative financial instruments including hedging additional currency pairs. We do not, and do not intend to, engage in the practice of trading derivative securities for profit.38Table of ContentsWe currently generate a significant portion of our net revenue and incur a significant portion of our expenses in Canada. We also hold a significant portion of our net assets in Canada. The reporting currency for our consolidated financial statements is the U.S. dollar. A weakening of the U.S. dollar against the Canadian dollar results in:•the following impacts to the consolidated statements of operations:–an increase in our net revenue upon translation of the sales made by our Canadian subsidiaries into U.S. dollars for the purposes of consolidation;–an increase in our selling, general and administrative expenses incurred by our Canadian subsidiaries upon translation into U.S. dollars for the purposes of consolidation;–foreign exchange revaluation losses by our Canadian subsidiaries on U.S. dollar denominated monetary assets; and–derivative valuation gains on forward currency contracts not designated in a hedging relationship;•the following impacts to the consolidated balance sheets:–an increase in the foreign currency translation adjustment which arises on the translation of our Canadian subsidiaries' balance sheets into U.S. dollars; and–a decrease in the foreign currency translation adjustment from derivative valuation losses on forward currency contracts, entered into as net investment hedges of a Canadian subsidiary.During fiscal 2017, the change in the relative value of the U.S. dollar against the Canadian dollar resulted in a $44.4 million reduction in accumulated other comprehensive loss within stockholders' equity. During fiscal 2016, the change in the relative value of the U.S. dollar against the Canadian dollar resulted in a $41.7 million reduction in accumulated other comprehensive loss within stockholders' equity.A 10% depreciation in the relative value of the U.S. dollar against the Canadian dollar compared to the exchange rates in effect for fiscal 2017 would have resulted in additional income from operations of approximately $1.0 million in fiscal 2017. This assumes a consistent 10% depreciation in the U.S. dollar against the Canadian dollar throughout the fiscal year. The timing of changes in the relative value of the U.S. dollar combined with the seasonal nature of our business, can affect the magnitude of the impact that fluctuations in foreign exchange rates have on our income from operations.Interest Rate Risk. Our revolving credit facility provides us with available borrowings in an amount up to $150.0 million in the aggregate. Because our revolving credit facility bears interest at a variable rate, we will be exposed to market risks relating to changes in interest rates, if we have a meaningful outstanding balance. As of January 28, 2018, aside from letters of credit of $1.2 million, we had no other borrowings outstanding under this credit facility. We currently do not engage in any interest rate hedging activity and currently have no intention to do so. However, in the future, if we have a meaningful outstanding balance under our revolving facility, in an effort to mitigate losses associated with these risks, we may at times enter into derivative financial instruments, although we have not historically done so. These may take the form of forward contracts, option contracts, or interest rate swaps. We do not, and do not intend to, engage in the practice of trading derivative securities for profit.Our cash and cash equivalent balances are held in the form of cash on hand, bank balances, and short-term deposits with original maturities of three months or less. We do not believe these balances are subject to material interest rate risk. Credit Risk. We have cash and cash equivalents on deposit with various large, reputable financial institutions. The amount of cash and cash equivalents held with certain financial institutions exceeds government-insured limits. We are also exposed to credit-related losses in the event of nonperformance by the financial institutions that are counterparties to our forward currency contracts. The credit risk amount is our unrealized gains on our derivative instruments, based on foreign currency rates at the time of nonperformance. We have not experienced any losses related to these items, and we believe credit risk to be minimal. We seek to minimize our credit risk by entering into transactions with credit worthy and reputable financial institutions and by monitoring the credit standing of the financial institutions with whom we transact. We seek to limit the amount exposure with any one counterparty. InflationInflationary factors such as increases in the cost of our product and overhead costs may adversely affect our operating results. Although we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations to date, a high rate of inflation in the future may have an adverse effect on our ability to maintain current levels of gross margin and selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenue if the selling prices of our products do not increase with these increased costs.39Table of Contents",2023-12-30 21:53:33.125821

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSOur fiscal year ends on the Sunday closest to January 31 of the following year, typically resulting in a 52 week year, but occasionally giving rise to an additional week, resulting in a 53 week year.Fiscal 2018 was a 53 week year. Net revenue includes results from the 53rd week; however, total comparable sales, comparable store sales, and changes in direct to consumer net revenue exclude the 53rd week. Fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016 were 52 week years. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements based on current expectations that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions, such as our plans, objectives, expectations, and intentions set forth in the ""Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements."" Our actual results and the timing of events may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth in the ""Item 1A. Risk Factors"" section and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.We disclose material non-public information through one or more of the following channels: our investor relations website (http://investor.lululemon.com/), the social media channels identified on our investor relations website, press releases, SEC filings, public conference calls, and webcasts.OverviewFiscal 2018 was a particularly strong year for our company. In addition, we were happy to welcome our new CEO, Calvin McDonald. Net revenue grew 24%, and total comparable sales increased 18%. We leveraged investments made across the enterprise over the last several years, while at the same time continuing to invest in our future. We surpassed several of our fiscal 2020 goals in fiscal 2018, two years ahead of schedule. These include achieving operating margin of 21.5%, gross margin of 55.2%, and e-commerce becoming 26.1% of our global business.Fueling our performance this year was strength across our product assortment, 13% square footage growth driven by new stores and our remodel program, and a robust e-commerce business. In addition, our brand activations, local community events, and educators continue to connect us with our guests in a truly unique manner.Our product design and development teams successfully launched new product innovations, while also leveraging our core product collections and expanding our Office/Travel/Commute category. We took several steps toward expanding our bra category by launching the Speed Up and Fine Form styles and also the Like Nothing bra, our first bra developed for all day wear. For men, we launched our Out-of-Mind short liner in our three core styles, rolled out the City Sweat collection, and further expanded our ABC pant offering with a new slim silhouette. We also expanded our outerwear assortment with more cold weather styles including the Cloudscape jacket for women and Outpour parka for men. We look forward to delivering on a strong pipeline of innovation and product roll-outs in fiscal 2019.During the year, we opened 36 net new company-operated stores, including 15 in North America, 13 in Asia Pacific, and eight in Europe. We also expanded our seasonal store strategy this year with approximately 45 seasonal stores in operation during the holiday season. These stores allow us to better cater to our guests in select markets during the holidays, while also helping introduce new guests into our brand.As of February 3, 2019, we had 70 stores in Asia Pacific and 21 stores in Europe. We expanded into two new markets in Europe this year - France and Sweden. In Asia, we opened seven new stores in China, in addition to growing our local e-commerce presence via Tmall and launching a store on the WeChat platform. In fiscal 2018, we leveraged the improvements we made to our websites over the past 18 months while continuing to enhance the customer experience. The sales performance of our e-commerce business was strong throughout the year, with direct to consumer revenues increasing by 45%, excluding the 53rd week of fiscal 2018. In fiscal 2019, we plan to continue to develop our omni-channel experience to serve guests wherever and however they choose to shop. We will continue to leverage our ship-from-store capabilities and build on the early success of our new buy online, pick-up in store initiative.Our grassroots approach to brand-building - locally led by our stores, enables us to connect with and uniquely understand our guest. In fiscal 2018, we continued to hold our marquee events including our annual SeaWheeze half marathon in Vancouver, The Ghost Race in 12 cities in North America, the Sweatlife Festival in London, and Unroll China events across multiple cities. We are also particularly pleased with our brand activations this year including our 20th birthday celebration, our donations to local community-based organizations via our Here to Be program, including on International Day of Yoga, and our announcement of 100% pay equity which closely followed International Women's Day.19Table of ContentsWe look forward to continuing this strong momentum into fiscal 2019 fueled by product innovations, new store openings, remodels, and further enhancements to our e-commerce sites and supply chain.Financial HighlightsThe summary below provides both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures.

Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $3.84 compared to $2.59 for fiscal 2017.Refer to the non-GAAP reconciliation tables contained in the ""Non-GAAP Financial Measures"" section of this ""Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations"" for reconciliations between constant dollar changes in net revenue, total comparable sales, comparable store sales, and direct to consumer net revenue, and adjusted gross profit, gross margin, income from operations, operating margin, income tax expense, effective tax rates, and diluted earnings per share, and the most directly comparable measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.GeneralNet revenue is comprised of company-operated store sales, direct to consumer sales through www.lululemon.com, other country and region specific websites, and mobile apps, including mobile apps on in-store devices that allow demand to be fulfilled via our distribution centers, and other net revenue, which includes outlet sales, sales from temporary locations, sales to wholesale accounts, showroom sales, license and supply arrangement net revenue which consists of royalties as well as sales of our products to licensees, and warehouse sales.Cost of goods sold includes the cost of purchased merchandise, including freight, duty, and nonrefundable taxes incurred in delivering the goods to our distribution centers. It also includes occupancy costs and depreciation expense for our company-operated store locations, all costs incurred in operating our distribution centers and production, design, distribution, and merchandise departments, hemming, shrink, and inventory provision expense. The primary drivers of the costs of individual products are the costs of raw materials and labor in the countries where we source our merchandise.Selling, general and administrative expenses consist of all operating costs not otherwise included in cost of goods sold or asset impairment and restructuring costs. We expect selling, general and administrative expenses to increase in fiscal 2019 as we incur additional operating expenses to support our store and direct to consumer growth, while also making strategic investments to support the long term growth of the business.Asset impairment and restructuring costs consist of the lease termination, impairment of property and equipment, employee related costs, and other restructuring costs recognized in connection with the restructuring of our ivivva operations.Income tax expense depends on the statutory tax rates in the countries where we sell our products and the proportion of taxable income earned in those jurisdictions. To the extent the relative proportion of taxable income in the jurisdictions fluctuates, or the tax legislation in the respective jurisdictions changes, so will our effective tax rate. We also anticipate that, in 20Table of Contentsthe future, we may start to sell our products through retail locations in countries in which we have not yet operated, in which case, we would become subject to taxation based on the foreign statutory rates in the countries where these sales take place and our effective tax rate could fluctuate accordingly.Results of OperationsThe following tables summarize key components of our results of operations for the periods indicated, both in dollars and as a percentage of net revenue: Fiscal Year Ended February 3, 2019 January 28, 2018 January 29, 2017 (In thousands)Net revenue $3,288,319 $2,649,181 $2,344,392Cost of goods sold 1,472,032 1,250,391 1,144,775Gross profit 1,816,287 1,398,790 1,199,617Selling, general and administrative expenses 1,110,451 904,264 778,465Asset impairment and restructuring costs — 38,525 —Income from operations 705,836 456,001 421,152Other income (expense), net 9,414 3,997 1,577Income before income tax expense 715,250 459,998 422,729Income tax expense 231,449 201,336 119,348Net income $483,801 $258,662 $303,381 Fiscal Year Ended February 3, 2019 January 28, 2018 January 29, 2017 (Percentages)Net revenue 100.0% 100.0% 100.0%Cost of goods sold 44.8 47.2 48.8Gross profit 55.2 52.8 51.2Selling, general and administrative expenses 33.8 34.1 33.2Asset impairment and restructuring costs — 1.5 —Income from operations 21.5 17.2 18.0Other income (expense), net 0.3 0.2 —Income before income tax expense 21.8 17.4 18.0Income tax expense 7.0 7.6 5.1Net income 14.7% 9.8% 12.9%Comparison of Fiscal 2018 to Fiscal 2017 Net RevenueNet revenue increased $639.1 million, or 24%, to $3.3 billion in fiscal 2018 from $2.6 billion in fiscal 2017. On a constant dollar basis, assuming the average exchange rates in fiscal 2018 remained constant with the average exchange rates in fiscal 2017, net revenue increased $651.3 million, or 25%.The increase in net revenue was primarily due to increased direct to consumer net revenue, net revenue generated by new company-operated stores, and an increase in comparable store sales. Total comparable sales, which includes comparable store sales and direct to consumer, and excludes net revenue of $53.0 million from the 53rd week of fiscal 2018, increased 18% in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017. Total comparable sales increased 18% on a constant dollar basis.21Table of ContentsOur net revenue on a segment basis for fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 is summarized below. Net revenue is expressed in dollar amounts. The percentages are presented as a percentage of total net revenue. Fiscal Years Ended February 3, 2019 and January 28, 2018 2018 2017 2018 2017 (In thousands) (Percentages)Company-operated stores $2,126,363 $1,837,065 64.7% 69.3%Direct to consumer 858,856 577,590 26.1 21.8Other 303,100 234,526 9.2 8.9Net revenue $3,288,319 $2,649,181 100.0% 100.0%Company-Operated Stores. Net revenue from our company-operated stores segment increased $289.3 million, or 16%, to $2.1 billion in fiscal 2018 from $1.8 billion in fiscal 2017. The following contributed to the increase in net revenue from our company-operated stores segment:•Net revenue from company-operated stores we opened or significantly expanded subsequent to January 28, 2018, and are therefore not included in comparable store sales, increased net revenue by $182.7 million. During fiscal 2018 we opened 36 net new company-operated stores, including 15 stores in North America, 13 stores in Asia Pacific, and eight stores in Europe.•A comparable store sales increase of 7% in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 resulted in a $105.5 million increase to net revenue. Comparable store sales increased 8%, or $111.6 million on a constant dollar basis. The increase in comparable store sales was primarily a result of increased store traffic and improved conversion rates.•Net revenue of $32.7 million from the 53rd week of fiscal 2018, which was excluded in the calculation of comparable store sales.These increases in net revenue were partially offset by the closure of 48 of our ivivva branded company-operated stores as part of the restructuring of our ivivva operations. These closures reduced our fiscal 2018 net revenue from company-operated stores by $31.6 million compared to fiscal 2017.Direct to Consumer. Net revenue from our direct to consumer segment increased $281.3 million to $858.9 million in fiscal 2018 from $577.6 million in fiscal 2017. We generated net revenue of $20.3 million in the 53rd week of fiscal 2018 from our direct to consumer segment. Excluding net revenue from the 53rd week of fiscal 2018, direct to consumer net revenue increased 45%, or increased 46% on a constant dollar basis. The increase in net revenue from our direct to consumer segment was primarily the result of increased traffic on our e-commerce websites, improved conversion rates, and increased dollar value per transaction. During the second quarter of fiscal 2017, we held online warehouse sales in the United States and Canada which generated net revenue of $12.3 million. We did not hold any online warehouse sales during fiscal 2018.Other. Net revenue from our other segment increased $68.6 million, or 29%, to $303.1 million in fiscal 2018 from $234.5 million in fiscal 2017. This increase was primarily the result of an increased number of temporary locations, including seasonal stores, open during fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017, and an increase in net revenue from existing outlets and sales to wholesale accounts during fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017. The increase in net revenue from our other segment was partially offset by lower net revenue from showrooms, primarily due to a decreased number of showrooms open during fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017.Gross ProfitGross profit increased $417.5 million, or 30%, to $1.8 billion in fiscal 2018 from $1.4 billion in fiscal 2017.Gross profit as a percentage of net revenue, or gross margin, increased 240 basis points, to 55.2% in fiscal 2018 from 52.8% in fiscal 2017. The increase in gross margin was primarily the result of:•an increase in product margin of 210 basis points, which was primarily due to lower product costs, a favorable mix of higher margin product, and lower markdowns;•a decrease in occupancy and depreciation costs as a percentage of revenue of 40 basis points; and •the costs incurred in fiscal 2017 in connection with the restructuring of our ivivva operations, which reduced gross margin in fiscal 2017 by 30 basis points.This was partially offset by an increase in costs as a percentage of revenue related to our product team departments and distribution centers of 30 basis points, and an unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates of 10 basis points.22Table of ContentsDuring fiscal 2017, as a result of the restructuring of our ivivva operations, we recognized costs totaling $8.7 million within costs of goods sold, as outlined in Note 13 to the audited consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this report. Excluding these charges, gross profit increased 29.0% and gross margin increased 210 basis points.Selling, General and Administrative ExpensesSelling, general and administrative expenses increased $206.2 million, or 23%, to $1.1 billion in fiscal 2018 from $904.3 million in fiscal 2017. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to:•an increase in costs related to our operating channels of $135.3 million, comprised of:–an increase in employee costs of $66.5 million primarily from a growth in labor hours and benefits, mainly associated with new company-operated stores and other new operating locations, and due to higher retail bonus expenses;–an increase in variable costs such as distribution costs, credit card fees, and packaging costs of $43.1 million primarily as a result of increased net revenue; and–an increase in other costs of $25.7 million primarily due to an increase in digital marketing expenses, brand and community costs, and other costs associated with our operating locations including security and repairs and maintenance;•an increase in head office costs of $65.0 million, comprised of:–an increase in employee costs of $38.0 million primarily due to additional employees to support the growth in our business and increased incentive and stock-based compensation expense; and–an increase in other costs of $27.0 million primarily due to an increase in brand and community costs, depreciation, professional fees, and information technology costs; and•a decrease in net foreign exchange and derivative revaluation gains of $5.9 million.As a percentage of net revenue, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 30 basis points, to 33.8% in fiscal 2018 from 34.1% in fiscal 2017.Asset Impairment and Restructuring CostsDuring fiscal 2017, we incurred asset impairment and restructuring costs totaling $38.5 million in connection with the restructuring of our ivivva operations. This included lease termination costs of $21.1 million, long-lived asset impairment charges of $11.6 million, employee related costs of $4.2 million, and other restructuring costs of $1.6 million. We did not have any asset impairment and restructuring costs in fiscal 2018. Please refer to Note 13 to the audited consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this report for further information on these adjustments.Income from OperationsIncome from operations increased $249.8 million, or 55%, to $705.8 million in fiscal 2018 from $456.0 million in fiscal 2017. Operating margin increased 430 basis points to 21.5% compared to 17.2% in fiscal 2017.In connection with the restructuring of our ivivva operations, we recognized pre-tax costs totaling $47.2 million in fiscal 2017. This included costs of $8.7 million recognized in cost of goods sold, and asset impairment and restructuring costs totaling $38.5 million. Excluding these charges from the comparatives of fiscal 2017, income from operations increased 40% and operating margin increased 250 basis points.On a segment basis, we determine income from operations without taking into account our general corporate expenses and the costs we incurred in connection with the restructuring of our ivivva operations. In the first quarter of fiscal 2018, we reviewed our general corporate expenses and determined certain costs which were previously classified as general corporate expenses are more appropriately classified within our direct to consumer segment. Accordingly, comparative figures have been reclassified to conform to the financial presentation adopted for the current year.23Table of ContentsSegmented income from operations before general corporate expenses and restructuring related costs for fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 is summarized below and is expressed in dollar amounts. The percentages are presented as a percentage of net revenue of the respective operating segments. Fiscal Years Ended February 3, 2019 and January 28, 2018 2018 2017 2018 2017 (In thousands) (Percentages)Segmented income from operations: Company-operated stores $575,536 $464,321 27.1% 25.3%Direct to consumer 354,107 224,076 41.2 38.8Other 62,558 35,580 20.6 15.2 992,201 723,977 General corporate expenses 286,365 220,753 Restructuring and related costs — 47,223 Income from operations $705,836 $456,001 Company-Operated Stores. Segmented income from operations from our company-operated stores increased $111.2 million, or 24%, to $575.5 million for fiscal 2018 from $464.3 million for fiscal 2017. The increase was primarily the result of increased gross profit of $176.9 million which was primarily due to increased net revenue and higher gross margin. This was partially offset by an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses, primarily due to increased employee costs, increased store operating expenses including higher credit card fees, distribution costs, and packaging costs as a result of higher net revenue, and due to increased community, security, and repairs and maintenance costs. Income from operations as a percentage of company-operated stores net revenue increased by 180 basis points, primarily due to an increase in gross margin and leverage on selling, general and administrative expenses.Direct to Consumer. Segmented income from operations from our direct to consumer increased $130.0 million, or 58%, to $354.1 million in fiscal 2018 from $224.1 million in fiscal 2017. The increase was primarily the result of increased gross profit of $187.0 million which was primarily due to increased net revenue and higher gross margin. This was partially offset by an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses primarily due to higher variable costs including distribution costs, credit card fees, and packaging costs as a result of higher net revenue, higher digital marketing expenses, and increased employee costs. Income from operations as a percentage of direct to consumer net revenue has increased by 240 basis points, primarily due to leverage on selling, general and administrative expenses and an increase in gross margin.Other. Other segmented income from operations increased $27.0 million, or 76%, to $62.6 million in fiscal 2018 from $35.6 million in fiscal 2017. The increase was primarily the result of increased gross profit of $44.9 million which was primarily due to increased net revenue and higher gross margin. The increase in gross profit was partially offset by an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses, including increased employee costs, increased operating expenses including higher distribution costs and higher credit card fees as a result of higher net revenue, and due to higher community costs. Income from operations as a percentage of other net revenue increased 540 basis points, primarily due to an increase in gross margin and leverage on selling, general and administrative expenses.General Corporate Expenses. General corporate expenses increased $65.6 million, or 30%, to $286.4 million in fiscal 2018 from $220.8 million in fiscal 2017. This increase was primarily due to increases in head office employee costs, brand and community costs, depreciation, information technology costs, and professional fees and a decrease in net foreign exchange and derivative gains of $5.9 million. We expect general corporate expenses to continue to increase in future years as we grow our overall business and require increased efforts at our head office to support our company-operated stores, direct to consumer and other segments.Other Income (Expense), NetThere was net other income of $9.4 million in fiscal 2018 compared to $4.0 million in fiscal 2017. The increase was primarily due to higher rates of return on our cash and cash equivalents, including money market funds, treasury bills, and term deposits in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017. This was partially offset by an increase in interest expense, primarily related to borrowings on our revolving credit facility during fiscal 2018. We repaid the outstanding balance on our revolving credit facility during the third quarter of fiscal 2018 and had no other borrowings outstanding under this credit facility as of February 3, 2019.24Table of ContentsIncome Tax ExpenseIncome tax expense increased $30.1 million, or 15%, to $231.4 million in fiscal 2018 from $201.3 million in fiscal 2017.U.S. tax reform was enacted on December 22, 2017 and introduced significant changes to U.S. income tax law. In fiscal 2017, we recognized a provisional income tax expense of $59.3 million in relation to U.S. tax reform. We completed the accounting for the income tax effects of U.S. tax reform during fiscal 2018. This resulted in the recognition of an additional tax expense of $7.5 million related to the mandatory one-time transition tax on the deemed repatriation of accumulated undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries.In fiscal 2018, we also completed our assessment of the impact that U.S. tax reform has upon repatriation taxes, our reinvestment plans, and the most efficient means of deploying our capital resources globally. We concluded that the net investment in a Canadian subsidiary in excess of the amounts necessary to sustain our business operations would no longer be indefinitely reinvested and $778.9 million was repatriated from that subsidiary. This resulted in the recognition of a tax expense of $23.7 million in fiscal 2018.During fiscal 2017, we recognized an income tax recovery of $12.7 million related to the tax effect of the costs recognized in connection with the ivivva restructuring.Further information on the adjustments recognized in both fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 is outlined in Note 14 to the audited consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this report. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2018 was 32.4% compared to 43.8% for fiscal 2017. Our effective tax rate excluding the above tax adjustments related to U.S. tax reform and the ivivva restructuring was 28.0% for fiscal 2018 compared to 30.5% for fiscal 2017. The decrease in our adjusted effective tax rate was primarily due to the lower U.S. federal income tax rate which was effective January 1, 2018, a decrease in state taxes, an increase in tax deductions related to stock-based compensation, increased research and development tax credits, and certain other adjustments. Net IncomeNet income increased $225.1 million, or 87%, to $483.8 million in fiscal 2018 from $258.7 million in fiscal 2017. The increase in net income in fiscal 2018 was primarily due to an increase in gross profit of $417.5 million, a reduction in asset impairment and restructuring costs of $38.5 million, and an increase in other income (expense), net of $5.4 million, partially offset by an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses of $206.2 million and an increase in income tax expense of $30.1 million.Comparison of Fiscal 2017 to Fiscal 2016Net RevenueNet revenue increased $304.8 million, or 13%, to $2.6 billion in fiscal 2017 from $2.3 billion in fiscal 2016. On a constant dollar basis, assuming the average exchange rates in fiscal 2017 remained constant with the average exchange rates in fiscal 2016, net revenue increased $290.6 million, or 12%.The increase in net revenue was primarily due to net revenue generated by new company-operated stores as well as increased direct to consumer net revenue. Total comparable sales, which includes comparable store sales and direct to consumer, increased 7% in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016. Total comparable sales increased 7% on a constant dollar basis.Our net revenue on a segment basis for fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016 is summarized below. Net revenue is expressed in dollar amounts.

The following contributed to the increase in net revenue from our company-operated stores segment:25Table of Contents•Net revenue from company-operated stores we opened or significantly expanded subsequent to January 29, 2017, and are therefore not included in comparable store sales, increased net revenue by $146.5 million. During fiscal 2017 we opened 46 net new lululemon branded company-operated stores, including 30 stores in North America, 14 stores in Asia Pacific, and two stores in Europe. •A comparable store sales increase of 1% in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 resulted in a $12.8 million increase to net revenue. Comparable store sales increased 1%, or $5.4 million on a constant dollar basis. The increase in comparable store sales was primarily a result of improved conversion rates and increased dollar value per transaction. This was partially offset by a decrease in store traffic, due in part to shifting retail traffic trends from in-store to online.These increases in net revenue were partially offset by the closure of 48 of our ivivva branded company-operated stores as part of the restructuring of our ivivva operations. These closures reduced our fiscal 2017 net revenue from company-operated stores by $26.6 million compared to fiscal 2016.Direct to Consumer. Net revenue from our direct to consumer segment increased $124.3 million, or 27%, to $577.6 million in fiscal 2017 from $453.3 million in fiscal 2016. Direct to consumer net revenue increased 27% on a constant dollar basis. The increase in net revenue from our direct to consumer segment was primarily the result of increased traffic on our e-commerce websites, improved conversion rates, and increased dollar value per transaction. During the second quarter of fiscal 2017, we held online warehouse sales in the United States and Canada which generated net revenue of $12.3 million. We did not hold any online warehouse sales during fiscal 2016. Excluding the impact of the online warehouse sales, direct to consumer net revenue increased 25%. Other. Net revenue from our other segment increased $47.8 million, or 26%, to $234.5 million in fiscal 2017 from $186.7 million in fiscal 2016. This increase was primarily the result of an increase in the number of outlets, increased net revenue at existing outlets, and an increase in the number of temporary locations. The increase in net revenue from our other segment was partially offset by lower net revenue from showrooms, primarily due to a decrease in the number of showrooms open during fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016.Gross ProfitGross profit increased $199.2 million, or 17%, to $1.4 billion in fiscal 2017 from $1.2 billion in fiscal 2016. Gross profit as a percentage of net revenue, or gross margin, increased 160 basis points, to 52.8% in fiscal 2017 from 51.2% in fiscal 2016. The increase in gross margin was primarily the result of:•an increase in product margin of 200 basis points which was primarily due to lower product costs and a favorable mix of higher margin product, partially offset by higher markdowns, and higher shrink and damages; and•a favorable impact of foreign exchange rates of 10 basis points.This was partially offset by an increase in fixed costs related to our product and supply chain departments of 20 basis points, and costs incurred in connection with the restructuring of our ivivva operations of 30 basis points.During fiscal 2017, as a result of the restructuring of our ivivva operations, we recognized costs totaling $8.7 million within costs of goods sold, as outlined in Note 13 to the audited consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this report. Excluding these charges, adjusted gross profit increased 17.3% to $1.4 billion and adjusted gross margin increased 190 basis points to 53.1% compared to fiscal 2016.Selling, General and Administrative ExpensesSelling, general and administrative expenses increased $125.8 million, or 16%, to $904.3 million in fiscal 2017 from $778.5 million in fiscal 2016. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to:•an increase in costs related to our operating channels of $91.4 million, comprised of:–an increase in employee costs of $32.8 million primarily from a growth in labor hours and benefits, mainly associated with new company-operated stores and other new operating locations;–an increase in variable costs such as distribution costs and credit card fees of $16.4 million primarily as a result of increased net revenue; and–an increase in other costs of $42.2 million primarily due to an increase in digital marketing expenses, website related costs including photography costs, brand and community costs, information technology related costs, and other costs associated with our operating locations;26Table of Contents•an increase in head office costs of $50.0 million, comprised of:–an increase in employee costs of $19.3 million primarily due to additional employees to support the growth in our business; and–an increase in other costs of $30.7 million primarily due to increases in information technology related costs, brand and community costs, and professional fees.The increase in selling, general, and administrative expenses was partially offset by an increase in net foreign exchange and derivative gains of $15.6 million. There were net foreign exchange and derivative gains of $7.3 million in fiscal 2017 compared to net foreign exchange losses of $8.3 million in fiscal 2016. The net foreign exchange gains and losses primarily relate to the revaluation of U.S. dollar denominated monetary assets and liabilities held by Canadian subsidiaries. During fiscal 2017, we began entering into forward currency contracts designed to economically hedge these foreign exchange revaluation gains and losses. We have not applied hedge accounting to these instruments and the change in fair value of these derivatives is recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses.As a percentage of net revenue, selling, general and administrative expenses increased 90 basis points, to 34.1% in fiscal 2017 from 33.2% in fiscal 2016.Asset Impairment and Restructuring CostsAs a result of the restructuring of our ivivva operations, we recognized asset impairment and restructuring costs of $38.5 million in fiscal 2017. This includes lease termination costs of $21.1 million, long-lived asset impairment charges of $11.6 million, employee related costs of $4.2 million, and other restructuring costs of $1.6 million. We did not have any asset impairment and restructuring costs in fiscal 2016. Please refer to Note 13 to the audited consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this report for further information on these adjustments.Income from OperationsIncome from operations increased $34.8 million, or 8%, to $456.0 million in fiscal 2017 from $421.2 million in fiscal 2016. Operating margin decreased 80 basis points to 17.2% compared to 18.0% in fiscal 2016.In connection with the restructuring of our ivivva operations, we recognized pre-tax costs totaling $47.2 million in fiscal 2017. This includes asset impairment and restructuring costs of $38.5 million and costs recognized in cost of goods sold totaling $8.7 million. Excluding these charges, adjusted income from operations increased 19% to $503.2 million and adjusted operating margin increased 100 basis points to 19.0%.On a segment basis, we determine income from operations without taking into account our general corporate expenses and the costs we incur in connection with the restructuring of our ivivva operations.

The increase was primarily the result of an increase in gross profit of $89.4 million, which was primarily due to increased net revenue and higher gross margin. The increase in gross profit was partially offset by an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses, including increased store employee costs, increased brand and community costs, and increased operating expenses associated with higher net revenues and new stores. Income from operations as a percentage of company-operated stores net revenue increased by 90 basis points primarily due to increased gross margin, partially offset by deleverage of selling, general and administrative expenses.Direct to Consumer. Segmented income from operations from our direct to consumer increased $44.1 million, or 24%, to $224.1 million in fiscal 2017 from $180.0 million in fiscal 2016. The increase was primarily the result of an increase in gross profit of $88.7 million, which was primarily due to increased net revenue and higher gross margin. The increase in gross profit was partially offset by an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses including higher digital marketing expenses, website related costs, and higher variable costs such as packaging, distribution and credit card fees as a result of higher net revenue. Income from operations as a percentage of direct to consumer net revenue has decreased by 90 basis points primarily due to deleverage of selling, general and administrative expenses, partially offset by an increase in gross margin.Other. Other segmented income from operations increased $13.3 million, or 59%, to $35.6 million in fiscal 2017 from $22.3 million in fiscal 2016. The increase was primarily the result of increased gross profit of $29.8 million, which was primarily due to increased net revenue and higher gross margin. The increase in gross profit was partially offset by an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses, including increased employee costs, increased brand and community costs, and increased operating expenses associated with new locations and higher net revenues. Income from operations as a percentage of other net revenue increased 330 basis points primarily due to an increase in gross margin partially offset by deleverage of selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of other net revenue.General Corporate Expenses. General corporate expenses increased $24.0 million, or 12%, to $220.8 million in fiscal 2017 from $196.8 million in fiscal 2016. This increase was primarily due to increased head office employee costs, a global brand campaign, increases in other brand and community costs, professional fees, depreciation, and information technology related costs. These increases were partially offset by an increase in net foreign exchange and derivative gains of $15.6 million. There were net foreign exchange and derivative gains of $7.3 million in fiscal 2017 compared to net foreign exchange losses of $8.3 million in fiscal 2016. We expect general corporate expenses to continue to increase in future years as we grow our overall business and require increased efforts at our head office to support our company-operated stores, direct to consumer and other segments.Other Income (Expense), NetThere was net other income of $4.0 million in fiscal 2017 compared to $1.6 million in fiscal 2016. The increase was primarily due to increased net interest income in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016. The increase in net interest income was primarily due to a net interest expense of $1.7 million which was recorded in fiscal 2016 in relation to certain tax adjustments that are outlined in Note 14 to the audited consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this report, as well as interest earned on our increased cash and cash equivalents in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016.Income Tax ExpenseIncome tax expense increased $82.0 million, or 69%, to $201.3 million in fiscal 2017 from $119.3 million in fiscal 2016.In fiscal 2017 we recorded certain discrete tax adjustments which resulted in a net $46.6 million increase in income tax expense. These adjustments related to the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and to the ivivva restructuring. In fiscal 2016 we recorded certain separate tax adjustments related to the Company's transfer pricing arrangements between Canada and the U.S. The adjustments in fiscal 2016 resulted in an income tax recovery of $10.7 million. On December 22, 2017, legislation commonly referred to as the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (""U.S. tax reform"") was enacted. U.S. tax reform made significant changes to corporate income tax in the United States, including reducing the federal income tax rate from 35% to 21% and imposing a mandatory transition tax on accumulated foreign subsidiary earnings which have not previously been subject to U.S. income tax. As a result of these tax legislation changes we have recognized a provisional income tax expense of $58.9 million for the mandatory transition tax and we have remeasured our deferred income assets and liabilities, resulting in a provisional deferred income tax expense of $0.4 million. In fiscal 2017 we also recognized an income tax recovery of $12.7 million related to the tax effect of the costs recognized in connection with the ivivva restructuring.In fiscal 2016 we recognized an income tax recovery of $10.7 million as a result of the finalization of an Advance Pricing Arrangement with the Internal Revenue Service and the Canada Revenue Agency. This agreement determines the amount of 28Table of Contentsincome which is taxable in each respective jurisdiction, and the final terms of the arrangement resulted in an increased amount of income tax recoverable in the United States.Further information on the adjustments recognized in both fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016 is outlined in Notes 13 and 14 to the audited consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this report. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2017 was 43.8% compared to 28.2% for fiscal 2016. Our effective tax rate excluding the above tax and related interest adjustments was 30.5% for fiscal 2017 compared to 30.7% for fiscal 2016. The decrease in our adjusted effective tax rate was primarily due to the lower U.S. federal income tax rate which was effective January 1, 2018, a decrease in state taxes, and certain other adjustments.Net IncomeNet income decreased $44.7 million, or 15%, to $258.7 million in fiscal 2017 from $303.4 million in fiscal 2016. The decrease in net income in fiscal 2017 was primarily due to an increase of $125.8 million in selling, general and administrative expenses, an increase of $82.0 million in income tax expense, and asset impairment and restructuring costs of $38.5 million recognized in fiscal 2017, partially offset by a $199.2 million increase in gross profit and an increase in other income (expense), net of $2.4 million.Comparable SalesWe separately track comparable store sales, which reflect net revenue from company-operated stores that have been open, or open after being significantly expanded, for at least 12 full fiscal months. Net revenue from a store is included in comparable store sales beginning with the first fiscal month for which the store has a full fiscal month of sales in the prior year. Comparable store sales exclude sales from new stores that have not been open for at least 12 full fiscal months, from stores which have not been in their significantly expanded space for at least 12 full fiscal months, from stores which have been temporarily relocated for renovations, and week 53 net revenue, if applicable. Comparable store sales also exclude sales from direct to consumer, outlets, temporary locations, wholesale accounts, showrooms, through license and supply arrangements, warehouse sales, and sales from company-operated stores that we have closed.Total comparable sales combines comparable store sales and direct to consumer sales. We are evolving towards an omni-channel approach to support the shopping behavior of our guests. This involves country and region specific websites, mobile apps, including mobile apps on in-store devices that allow demand to be fulfilled via our distribution centers, social media, product notification emails, and online order fulfillment through stores. We therefore believe that reporting total comparable sales with comparable store sales and direct to consumer sales combined provides a relevant performance metric. Total comparable sales, including comparable store sales and direct to consumer sales, exclude week 53 of net revenue, if applicable.Various factors affect comparable sales, including:•the location of new stores relative to existing stores;•consumer preferences, buying trends, and overall economic trends;•our ability to anticipate and respond effectively to customer preferences for technical athletic apparel;•competition;•changes in our merchandise mix;•pricing;•the timing of our releases of new merchandise and promotional events;•the effectiveness of our marketing efforts;•the design and ease of use of our websites and mobile apps; •the level of customer service that we provide in our stores and on our websites and mobile apps;•our ability to source and distribute products efficiently; and•the number of stores we open, close (including for temporary renovations), and expand in any period.Opening new stores and expanding existing stores is an important part of our growth strategy. Accordingly, total comparable sales has limited utility for assessing the success of our growth strategy insofar as comparable sales do not reflect the performance of stores opened, or significantly expanded, within the last 12 full fiscal months. The comparable sales measures we report may not be equivalent to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.29Table of ContentsNon-GAAP Financial MeasuresConstant dollar changes in net revenue, total comparable sales, comparable store sales, and direct to consumer net revenue, and the adjusted financial results are non-GAAP financial measures.A constant dollar basis assumes the average foreign exchange rates for the period remained constant with the average foreign exchange rates for the same period of the prior year. We provide constant dollar changes in net revenue, total comparable sales, comparable store sales, and direct to consumer net revenue because we use these measures to understand the underlying growth rate of net revenue excluding the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates. We believe that disclosing these measures on a constant dollar basis is useful to investors because it enables them to better understand the level of growth of our business.Adjusted gross profit, gross margin, income from operations, operating margin, income tax expense, effective tax rates, and diluted earnings per share exclude the amounts recognized in connection with U.S. tax reform, the costs and related tax effects recognized in connection with the restructuring of our ivivva operations, and certain discrete items related to our transfer pricing arrangements and taxes on repatriation of foreign earnings. We believe these adjusted financial measures are useful to investors as the adjustments do not directly relate to our ongoing business operations and therefore do not contribute to a meaningful evaluation of the trend in our operating performance. Furthermore, we do not believe the adjustments are reflective of our expectations of our future operating performance and believe these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors because of their comparability to our historical information.The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or with greater prominence to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures follows, which includes more detail on the GAAP financial measure that is most directly comparable to each non-GAAP financial measure, and the related reconciliations between these financial measures.The below changes in net revenue, total comparable sales, comparable store sales, and direct to consumer net revenue show the change compared to the corresponding period in the prior year. Total comparable sales, comparable store sales, and changes in direct to consumer net revenue calculations exclude net revenue from the 53rd week of fiscal 2018.30Table of ContentsConstant dollar changes in net revenue, total comparable sales, comparable store sales, and direct to consumer net revenue Fiscal Year Ended February 3, 2019 Fiscal Year Ended January 28, 2018 (In thousands) (Percentages) (In thousands) (Percentages)Change in net revenue $639,138 24% $304,789 13 %Adjustments due to foreign exchange rate changes 12,116 1 (14,221) (1)Change in net revenue in constant dollars $651,254 25% $290,568 12 % Fiscal Year Ended February 3, 2019 January 28, 2018Change in total comparable sales(1),(2),(3) 18% 7%Adjustments due to foreign exchange rate changes — —Change in total comparable sales in constant dollars(1),(2),(3) 18% 7% Fiscal Year Ended February 3, 2019 Fiscal Year Ended January 28, 2018 (In thousands) (Percentages) (In thousands) (Percentages)Change in comparable store sales(2),(3) $105,452 7% $12,820 1%Adjustments due to foreign exchange rate changes 6,129 1 (7,395) —Change in comparable store sales in constant dollars(2),(3) $111,581 8% $5,425 1% Fiscal Year Ended February 3, 2019 January 28, 2018Change in direct to consumer net revenue(3) 45% 27%Adjustments due to foreign exchange rate changes 1 —Change in direct to consumer net revenue in constant dollars(3) 46% 27%__________(1) Total comparable sales includes comparable store sales and direct to consumer sales.(2) Comparable store sales reflects net revenue from company-operated stores that have been open for at least 12 full fiscal months, or open for at least 12 full fiscal months after being significantly expanded.(3) Net revenue from the 53rd week of fiscal 2018 is excluded from the calculation.31Table of ContentsAdjusted financial measuresThe following tables reconcile adjusted financial measures with the most directly comparable measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. The adjustments relate to the amounts recognized in connection with U.S. tax reform, taxes on repatriation of foreign earnings, the restructuring of our ivivva operations and its related tax effects, and certain discrete items related to our transfer pricing arrangements.

Our primary cash needs are capital expenditures for opening new stores and 32Table of Contentsremodeling or relocating existing stores, investing in information technology and making system enhancements, funding working capital requirements, and making other strategic capital investments both in North America and internationally. We may also use cash to repurchase shares of our common stock. Cash and cash equivalents in excess of our needs are held in interest bearing accounts with financial institutions.As of February 3, 2019, our working capital (excluding cash and cash equivalents) was $47.5 million, our cash and cash equivalents were $881.3 million and our capacity under our revolving credit facility was $398.5 million.The following table summarizes our net cash flows provided by and used in operating, investing, and financing activities for the periods indicated: Fiscal Year Ended February 3, 2019 January 28, 2018 January 29, 2017 (In thousands)Total cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $742,779 $489,337 $386,392Investing activities (242,794) (173,392) (149,511)Financing activities (590,214) (97,862) (26,611)Effect of exchange rate changes on cash (18,952) 37,572 23,094(Decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents $(109,181) $255,655 $233,364Operating ActivitiesCash flows provided by operating activities consist primarily of net income adjusted for certain items including depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense, and the effect of changes in operating assets and liabilities.Net cash provided by operating activities increased $253.4 million in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017, primarily as a result of the following:Net income and non-cash items•an increase of $225.1 million in net income; and•an increase of $20.1 million in non-cash expenses, primarily due to the following:–an increase in deferred income taxes, depreciation, and stock-based compensation;–partially offset by the settlement of derivatives not designated in a hedging relationship and a decrease in asset impairment costs related to the restructuring of our ivivva operations. Changes in operating assets and liabilities•an increase of $8.2 million in the change in operating assets and liabilities, primarily due to the following:–an increase of $73.5 million related to accounts payable, primarily due to a change in our payment terms;–an increase of $28.7 million related to accrued compensation and related expenses, primarily due to the timing of salary payments, increased incentive compensation costs, and an increased number of employees;–partially offset by an increase of $64.1 million related to inventory, primarily due to an increase in inventory purchases, and a decrease of $18.0 million in income taxes. In fiscal 2017, net cash provided by operating activities increased $102.9 million compared to fiscal 2016, primarily as a result of the following:Changes in operating assets and liabilities•an increase of $104.0 million in the change in operating assets and liabilities, primarily due to the following:–$62.5 million related to income taxes, primarily due to income taxes payable in relation to U.S. tax reform;–$31.8 million related to other accrued and non-current liabilities, primarily due to changes in accrued operating expenses, forward currency contract liabilities, and tenant inducements.33Table of ContentsNet income and non-cash items•a decrease of $44.7 million in net income, partially offset by an increase of $43.6 million in non-cash expenses primarily related to asset impairment costs related to the restructuring of our ivivva operations, and an increase in depreciation.Investing ActivitiesCash flows used in investing activities relate to capital expenditures, the settlement of net investment hedges, and other investing activities. Cash used in investing activities increased $69.4 million, to $242.8 million in fiscal 2018 from $173.4 million in fiscal 2017. Cash used in investing activities increased $23.9 million, to $173.4 million in fiscal 2017 from $149.5 million in fiscal 2016.Capital expenditures for our company-operated stores segment were $129.2 million, $80.2 million, $75.3 million in fiscal 2018, fiscal 2017, and fiscal 2016, respectively. The capital expenditures for our company-operated stores segment in each period were primarily for the remodeling or relocation of certain stores, for opening new company-operated stores, and ongoing store refurbishment. The increase in capital expenditures for our company-operated stores segment was primarily due to an increased number of store remodels and relocations including approximately 55 in fiscal 2018, 40 in fiscal 2017, and 30 in fiscal 2016. The capital expenditures for our company-operated stores segment also included $27.1 million to open 39 company-operated stores, $29.3 million to open 49 company-operated stores, and $30.6 million to open 46 new company-operated stores, in fiscal 2018, fiscal 2017, and fiscal 2016, respectively.Capital expenditures for our direct to consumer segment were $6.4 million, $19.9 million, and $11.5 million in fiscal 2018, fiscal 2017, and fiscal 2016, respectively. The capital expenditures for our direct to consumer segment in fiscal 2018 were primarily related to our global and region specific websites as well as mobile apps, and in fiscal 2017 and 2016 were primarily related to our global website redesign as well as mobile app enhancements.Capital expenditures related to corporate activities and other were $90.2 million, $57.7 million, and $62.7 million in fiscal 2018, fiscal 2017, and fiscal 2016, respectively. The capital expenditures in each fiscal year were primarily related to investments in information technology and business systems, improvements at our head office and other corporate buildings, and for capital expenditures related to opening retail locations other than company-operated stores. In fiscal 2018, we also undertook various information technology infrastructure and corporate system initiatives. This included the continued development and implementation of our new enterprise resource planning system that will help improve our merchandising, costing, allocation, and inventory platforms.Capital expenditures are expected to range between $265 million and $275 million in fiscal 2019.Financing ActivitiesCash flows used in or provided by financing activities consist primarily of cash used to repurchase shares of our common stock and certain cash flows related to stock-based compensation. Cash used in financing activities increased $492.4 million, to $590.2 million in fiscal 2018 from $97.9 million in fiscal 2017. Cash used in financing activities increased $71.3 million, to $97.9 million in fiscal 2017 from $26.6 million in fiscal 2016. The primary cause of these changes in cash used in financing activities was our stock repurchase programs. During the fiscal years ended February 3, 2019, January 28, 2018, and January 29, 2017, 4.9 million, 1.9 million, and 0.5 million shares, respectively, were repurchased under the programs at a total cost of $598.3 million, $100.3 million, and $29.3 million, respectively. During the second quarter of fiscal 2018, we repurchased 3.3 million shares in a private transaction. The other common stock was repurchased in the open market at prevailing market prices, including under plans complying with the provisions of Rule 10b5-1 and Rule 10b-18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, with the timing and actual number of shares repurchased depending upon market conditions, eligibility to trade, and other factors.We believe that our cash and cash equivalent balances, cash generated from operations, and borrowings available to us under our revolving credit facility will be adequate to meet our liquidity needs and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months. Our cash from operations may be negatively impacted by a decrease in demand for our products as well as the other factors described in ""Item 1A. Risk Factors"". In addition, we may make discretionary capital improvements with respect to our stores, distribution facilities, headquarters, or systems, or we may repurchase shares under an approved stock repurchase program, which we would expect to fund through the use of cash, issuance of debt or equity securities or other external financing sources to the extent we were unable to fund such capital expenditures out of our cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from operations.34Table of ContentsRevolving Credit FacilityOn December 15, 2016, we entered into a credit agreement for $150.0 million under an unsecured five-year revolving credit facility. Bank of America, N.A., is administrative agent and HSBC Bank Canada is the syndication agent and letter of credit issuer, and the lenders party thereto. Borrowings under the revolving credit facility may be made, in U.S. Dollars, Euros, Canadian Dollars, and in other currencies, subject to the approval of the administrative agent and the lenders. Up to $35.0 million of the revolving credit facility is available for the issuance of letters of credit and up to $25.0 million is available for the issuance of swing line loans. Commitments under the revolving credit facility may be increased by up to $200.0 million, subject to certain conditions, including the approval of the lenders. Borrowings under the agreement may be prepaid and commitments may be reduced or terminated without premium or penalty (other than customary breakage costs). The principal amount outstanding under the credit agreement, if any, will be due and payable in full on December 15, 2021, subject to provisions that permit us to request a limited number of one year extensions annually. Borrowings made under the revolving credit facility bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at our option, either (a) a rate based on the rates applicable for deposits on the interbank market for U.S. Dollars or the applicable currency in which the borrowings are made (""LIBOR"") or (b) an alternate base rate, plus, in each case, an applicable margin. The applicable margin is determined by reference to a pricing grid, based on the ratio of indebtedness to earnings before interest, tax depreciation, amortization, and rent (""EBITDAR"") and ranges between 1.00%-1.75% for LIBOR loans and 0.00%-0.75% for alternate base rate loans. Additionally, a commitment fee of between 0.125%-0.200%, also determined by reference to the pricing grid, is payable on the average daily unused amounts under the revolving credit facility.The credit agreement contains negative covenants that, among other things and subject to certain exceptions, limit the ability of our subsidiaries to incur indebtedness, incur liens, undergo fundamental changes, make dispositions of all or substantially all of their assets, alter their businesses and enter into agreements limiting subsidiary dividends and distributions. We are also required to maintain a consolidated rent-adjusted leverage ratio of not greater than 3.50:1.00 and we are not permitted to allow the ratio of consolidated EBITDAR to consolidated interest charges (plus rent) to be less than 2.00:1.00. The credit agreement also contains certain customary representations, warranties, affirmative covenants, and events of default (including, among others, an event of default upon the occurrence of a change of control). If an event of default occurs, the credit agreement may be terminated, and the maturity of any outstanding amounts may be accelerated.On June 6, 2018, we entered into Amendment No. 1 to the credit agreement. The Amendment amends the credit agreement to provide for (i) an increase in the aggregate commitments under the unsecured five-year revolving credit facility to $400.0 million, with an increase of the sub-limits for the issuance of letters of credit and extensions of swing line loans to $50.0 million for each, (ii) an increase in the option, subject to certain conditions as set forth in the credit agreement, to request increases in commitments under the revolving facility from $400.0 million to $600.0 million and (iii) an extension in the maturity of the revolving facility from December 15, 2021 to June 6, 2023.In addition, the Amendment decreases the applicable margins for LIBOR loans from 1.00%-1.75% to 1.00%-1.50% and for alternate base rate loans from 0.00%-0.75% to 0.00%-0.50%, reduces the commitment fee on average daily unused amounts under the revolving facility from 0.125%-0.200% to 0.10%-0.20%, and reduces fees for unused letters of credit from 1.00%-1.75% to 1.00%-1.50%.As of February 3, 2019, aside from letters of credit of $1.5 million, we had no other borrowings outstanding under this credit facility.Contractual Obligations and CommitmentsLeases. We lease certain store and other retail locations, distribution centers, offices, and equipment under non-cancelable operating leases. Our leases generally have initial terms of between five and 10 years, and generally can be extended in five-year increments, if at all. A substantial number of our leases include renewal options and certain of our leases include rent escalation clauses, rent holidays and leasehold rental incentives, none of which are reflected in the table below. The majority of our leases for store premises also include contingent rental payments based on sales, the impact of which also are not reflected in the table below. Product purchase obligations. The amounts listed for product purchase obligations in the table below represent agreements (including open purchase orders) to purchase products in the ordinary course of business that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms. In some cases, prices are subject to change throughout the production process. The reported amounts exclude product purchase liabilities included in accounts payable and accrued inventory liabilities as of February 3, 2019.One-time transition tax. As outlined in Note 14 to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this report, U.S. tax reform imposed a mandatory transition tax on accumulated foreign subsidiary earnings which have 35Table of Contentsnot previously been subject to U.S. income tax. The one-time transition tax is payable over eight years beginning in fiscal 2018. The table below outlines the expected payments due by fiscal year.The following table summarizes our contractual arrangements as of February 3, 2019, and the timing and effect that such commitments are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods: Payments Due by Fiscal Year Total 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Thereafter (In thousands)Operating leases (minimum rent) $783,913 $169,822 $147,541 $123,032 $99,471 $73,213 $170,834Product purchase obligations 387,917 387,132 785 — — — —One-time transition tax payable 46,108 4,009 4,009 4,009 4,009 7,518 22,554Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsWe enter into standby letters of credit to secure certain of our obligations, including leases, taxes, and duties. As of February 3, 2019, letters of credit totaling $1.5 million had been issued.We have not entered into any transactions, agreements or other contractual arrangements to which an entity unconsolidated with us is a party and under which we have (i) any obligation under a guarantee, (ii) any retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity that serves as credit, liquidity or market risk support to such entity, (iii) any obligation under derivative instruments that are indexed to our shares and classified as equity in our consolidated balance sheets, or (iv) any obligation arising out of a variable interest in any unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit support to us or engages in leasing, hedging or research and development services with us.Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions. Predicting future events is inherently an imprecise activity and, as such, requires the use of judgment. Actual results may vary from our estimates in amounts that may be material to the financial statements. An accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically, could materially impact our consolidated financial statements. We believe that the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements:Revenue Recognition. Net revenue is comprised of company-operated store net revenue, direct to consumer net revenue through websites and mobile apps, including mobile apps on in-store devices that allow demand to be fulfilled via the Company's distribution centers, and other net revenue, which includes revenue from outlets, temporary locations, sales to wholesale accounts, showrooms, warehouse sales, and license and supply arrangement net revenue, which consists of royalties as well as sales of the Company's products to licensees. All net revenue is reported net of sales taxes collected from customers on behalf of taxing authorities.We record an estimated allowance for sales returns. This allowance is calculated based on a history of actual returns, estimated future returns, and any significant future known, or anticipated, events. Consideration of these factors results in an estimated allowance for sales returns and an asset for estimated returned inventory. Our standard terms for retail sales limit returns to approximately 30 days after sale; however, we accept returns after 30 days where the product fails to meet our guests' quality expectations.Proceeds from the sale of gift cards are initially deferred and recognized within ""Unredeemed gift card liability"" on the consolidated balance sheets, and are recognized as revenue when tendered for payment. To the extent there is no requirement to remit unclaimed card balances to government agencies, an estimate of the gift card balances that will never be redeemed is recognized as revenue in proportion to gift cards which have been redeemed. The estimate of gift cards that will never be redeemed is based on the historic trend of unredeemed cards. Inventory. Inventory is valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value. We periodically review our inventories and make provisions as necessary to appropriately value goods that are obsolete, have quality issues, or are damaged. The amount of the provision is equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and its net realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand, selling prices, and market conditions. If changes in market conditions result in reductions in the estimated 36Table of Contentsnet realizable value of our inventory below our previous estimate, we would increase our reserve in the period in which we made such a determination. In addition, we provide for inventory shrinkage as a percentage of sales, based on historical trends from actual physical inventories. Inventory shrinkage estimates are made to reduce the inventory value for lost or stolen items. We perform physical inventory counts and cycle counts throughout the year and adjust the shrink provision accordingly. Property and Equipment. Property and equipment are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation. Buildings are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the expected useful life of the asset, which is individually assessed, and estimated to be up to 20 years. Leasehold improvements are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the lesser of the length of the lease and the estimated useful life of the assets, up to a maximum of five years. All other property and equipment is depreciated using the declining balance method as follows: Furniture and fixtures 20%Computer hardware and software 20% - 30%Equipment and vehicles 30%Changes in circumstances, such as technological advances, can result in differences between the actual and estimated useful lives. In those cases where we determine that the useful life of a long-lived asset should be shortened, we increase depreciation expense over the remaining useful life to depreciate the asset's net book value to its estimated salvage value.Long-lived assets, including intangible assets with finite useful lives are evaluated for impairment when the occurrence of events or changes in circumstances indicates that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable as measured by comparing their net book value to the undiscounted estimated future cash flows generated by their use and eventual disposition. Impaired assets are recorded at fair value, determined principally by the present value of the estimated future cash flows expected from their use and eventual disposition. Income Taxes. The U.S. tax reform enacted on December 22, 2017 introduced significant changes to the U.S. income tax laws. The accounting for the income tax effects of U.S. tax reform is complex and requires significant judgement and estimates in the interpretation and calculations of its provisions. We completed the accounting for the income tax effects of U.S. tax reform during fiscal 2018. This resulted in the recognition of an additional tax expense of $7.5 million related to the mandatory one-time transition tax on the deemed repatriation of accumulated undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries.Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities, and for tax losses, tax credit carryforwards, and other tax attributes, using the enacted tax rates that are to be in effect when these differences are expected to reverse. Our deferred income tax balances and income tax rates are significantly affected by the tax rates on our global operations and the extent to which the net investment in our foreign subsidiaries are indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. Deferred income tax liabilities are recognized for U.S. federal and state income taxes and foreign withholding taxes on the amounts which are not indefinitely reinvested outside of the U.S. Indefinite reinvestment is determined by management's judgment about, and intentions concerning, the future operations of the Company.Deferred income tax liabilities are provided for U.S. income taxes on the taxable temporary differences associated with our investments in foreign subsidiaries, unless those amounts can be distributed on a tax-free basis or are indefinitely reinvested. We determine on a regular basis the amount of our net investment that will be indefinitely reinvested in our non-U.S. operations. This assessment is based on the cash flow projections and operational and fiscal objectives of each of our U.S. and foreign subsidiaries. Such estimates are inherently imprecise since many assumptions used in the projections are subject to revision. The possibility exists that amounts determined to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the U.S. may ultimately be repatriated.During fiscal 2018, as a result of U.S. tax reform, we changed our indefinite reinvestment assertion for a Canadian subsidiary and recognized a tax expense of $23.7 million upon repatriation of $778.9 million from that Canadian subsidiary. We continue to apply the indefinite reinvestment assertion to this Canadian subsidiary for the remaining net investment of $777.5 million which we consider necessary to sustain our existing business operations. Future earnings will not be subject to an indefinite reinvestment assumption. In the event we repatriate the remaining net investment in the Canadian subsidiary, we would be subject to tax of approximately $2.3 million, principally representing U.S. state income taxes. Excluding this Canadian subsidiary, the cumulative undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries as of February 3, 2019 were $26.0 million. We evaluate our tax filing positions and recognize the largest amount of tax benefit that is considered more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. This determination requires the use of significant judgment. Income tax expense is adjusted in the period in which an uncertain tax 37Table of Contentsposition is effectively settled, the statute of limitations expires, facts or circumstances change, tax laws change, or new information becomes available. Our tax positions include intercompany transfer pricing policies and the associated taxable income and deductions arising from intercompany charges between subsidiaries within the consolidated group. Although we believe that our intercompany transfer pricing policies and tax positions are reasonable, the final outcomes of tax audits or potential tax disputes may be materially different from that which is reflected in our income tax provisions and accruals.Stock-Based Compensation. We account for stock-based compensation using the fair value method. The fair value of awards granted is estimated at the date of grant. Awards settled in cash or common stock at the election of the employee are remeasured to fair value at the end of each reporting period until settlement. The employee compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. For awards with service and/or performance conditions, the amount of compensation expense recognized is based on the number of awards that are expected to vest. The estimation of the number of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment, and to the extent actual results differ from our estimates, such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised. We consider several factors when estimating the number of awards which are expected to vest, including, future profit forecasts, types of awards, size of option holder group, and anticipated employee retention and estimated expected forfeitures. Actual results may differ substantially from these estimates.The calculation of the grant-date fair value of stock options requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions, including, stock price volatility, and the expected life of the options. We evaluate and revise these estimates and assumptions as necessary, to reflect market conditions and our historical experience. The expected term of the options is based upon historical experience of similar awards, giving consideration to expectations of future employee behavior. Expected volatility is based upon the historical volatility of our common stock for the period corresponding with the expected term of the options. In the future, the expected volatility and expected term may change which could substantially change the grant-date fair value of future awards of stock options and, ultimately, the expense we record.Contingencies. In the ordinary course of business, we are involved in legal proceedings regarding contractual and employment relationships and a variety of other matters. We record contingent liabilities resulting from claims against us, when a loss is assessed to be probable and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable. Assessing probability of loss and estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors, including in some cases judgments about the potential actions of third-party claimants and courts. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKForeign Currency Exchange Risk. The functional currency of our foreign subsidiaries is generally the applicable local currency. Our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars. Therefore, the net revenue, expenses, assets, and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries are translated from their functional currencies into U.S. dollars. Fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar affect the reported amounts of net revenue, expenses, assets, and liabilities. Foreign exchange differences which arise on translation of our foreign subsidiaries' balance sheets into U.S. dollars are recorded as a foreign currency translation adjustment in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss within stockholders' equity.We also have exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates associated with transactions which are undertaken by our subsidiaries in currencies other than their functional currency. Such transactions include intercompany transactions and inventory purchases denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the purchasing entity. As a result, we have been impacted by changes in exchange rates and may be impacted for the foreseeable future. The potential impact of currency fluctuation increases as our international expansion increases.As of February 3, 2019, we had certain forward currency contracts outstanding in order to hedge a portion of the foreign currency exposure that arises on translation of a Canadian subsidiary into U.S. dollars. We also had certain forward currency contracts outstanding in an effort to reduce our exposure to the foreign exchange revaluation gains and losses that are recognized by our Canadian subsidiaries on U.S. dollar denominated monetary assets and liabilities. Please refer to Note 12 to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this report for further information, including details of the notional amounts outstanding.In the future, in an effort to reduce foreign exchange risks, we may enter into further derivative financial instruments including hedging additional currency pairs. We do not, and do not intend to, engage in the practice of trading derivative securities for profit.38Table of ContentsWe currently generate a significant portion of our net revenue and incur a significant portion of our expenses in Canada. We also hold a significant portion of our net assets in Canada. The reporting currency for our consolidated financial statements is the U.S. dollar. A strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Canadian dollar results in:•the following impacts to the consolidated statements of operations:–a decrease in our net revenue upon translation of the sales made by our Canadian operations into U.S. dollars for the purposes of consolidation;–an decrease in our selling, general and administrative expenses incurred by our Canadian operations upon translation into U.S. dollars for the purposes of consolidation;–foreign exchange revaluation gains by our Canadian subsidiaries on U.S. dollar denominated monetary assets and liabilities; and–derivative valuation losses on forward currency contracts not designated in a hedging relationship;•the following impacts to the consolidated balance sheets:–a decrease in the foreign currency translation adjustment which arises on the translation of our Canadian subsidiaries' balance sheets into U.S. dollars; and–an increase in the foreign currency translation adjustment from derivative valuation losses on forward currency contracts, entered into as net investment hedges of a Canadian subsidiary.During fiscal 2018, the change in the relative value of the U.S. dollar against the Canadian dollar resulted in a $83.2 million increase in accumulated other comprehensive loss within stockholders' equity. During fiscal 2017, the change in the relative value of the U.S. dollar against the Canadian dollar resulted in a $58.2 million reduction in accumulated other comprehensive loss within stockholders' equity.A 10% appreciation in the relative value of the U.S. dollar against the Canadian dollar compared to the exchange rates in effect for fiscal 2018 would have resulted in lower income from operations of approximately $5.6 million in fiscal 2018. This assumes a consistent 10% appreciation in the U.S. dollar against the Canadian dollar throughout the fiscal year. The timing of changes in the relative value of the U.S. dollar combined with the seasonal nature of our business, can affect the magnitude of the impact that fluctuations in foreign exchange rates have on our income from operations.Interest Rate Risk. Our revolving credit facility provides us with available borrowings in an amount up to $400.0 million in the aggregate. Because our revolving credit facility bears interest at a variable rate, we will be exposed to market risks relating to changes in interest rates, if we have a meaningful outstanding balance. As of February 3, 2019, aside from letters of credit of $1.5 million, we had no other borrowings outstanding under this credit facility. We currently do not engage in any interest rate hedging activity and currently have no intention to do so. However, in the future, if we have a meaningful outstanding balance under our revolving facility, in an effort to mitigate losses associated with these risks, we may at times enter into derivative financial instruments, although we have not historically done so. These may take the form of forward contracts, option contracts, or interest rate swaps. We do not, and do not intend to, engage in the practice of trading derivative securities for profit.Our cash and cash equivalent balances are held in the form of cash on hand, bank balances, short-term deposits and treasury bills with original maturities of three months or less, and in money market funds. We do not believe these balances are subject to material interest rate risk.Credit Risk. We have cash on deposit with various large, reputable financial institutions and have invested in U.S. and Canadian Treasury Bills, and in AAA-rated money market funds. The amount of cash and cash equivalents held with certain financial institutions exceeds government-insured limits. We are also exposed to credit-related losses in the event of nonperformance by the financial institutions that are counterparties to our forward currency contracts. The credit risk amount is our unrealized gains on our derivative instruments, based on foreign currency rates at the time of nonperformance. We have not experienced any losses related to these items, and we believe credit risk to be minimal. We seek to minimize our credit risk by entering into transactions with credit worthy and reputable financial institutions and by monitoring the credit standing of the financial institutions with whom we transact. We seek to limit the amount of exposure with any one counterparty.InflationInflationary factors such as increases in the cost of our product and overhead costs may adversely affect our operating results. Although we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations to date, a high rate of inflation in the future may have an adverse effect on our ability to maintain current levels of gross margin 39Table of Contentsand selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenue if the selling prices of our products do not increase with these increased costs.40Table of Contents",2023-12-30 21:53:33.429168

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSOur fiscal year ends on the Sunday closest to January 31 of the following year, typically resulting in a 52 week year, but occasionally giving rise to an additional week, resulting in a 53 week year.Fiscal 2019 was a 52 week year and fiscal 2018 was a 53 week year. Net revenue includes results from the 53rd week, however, comparable sales are calculated on a one week shifted basis such that the 52 weeks ended February 2, 2020 are compared to the 52 weeks ended February 3, 2019 rather than January 27, 2019. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.We have omitted the results of operations and cash flows for fiscal 2017, and the comparison of fiscal 2018 to fiscal 2017. For the omitted results and comparisons please refer to ""Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations"" of our fiscal 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 27, 2019.This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements based on current expectations that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions, such as our plans, objectives, expectations, and intentions included in the ""Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements."" Our actual results and the timing of events may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors, including those described in the ""Item 1A. Risk Factors"" section and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.We disclose material non-public information through one or more of the following channels: our investor relations website (http://investor.lululemon.com/), the social media channels identified on our investor relations website, press releases, SEC filings, public conference calls, and webcasts.OverviewOur business momentum continued in fiscal 2019. Net revenue grew 21% and total comparable sales increased 17%. In addition, we expanded our operating margin 80 basis points to 22.3% and grew earnings per share 37%, or 28% excluding certain discrete tax items which were recognized in fiscal 2018.Fueling our performance this year was strength across our product assortment, 18% square footage growth driven by new stores and our remodel program, and a robust e-commerce business. In addition, our local community events and educators continued to connect us with our guests in a truly unique manner.The Power of ThreeWe believe the first year of our Power of Three growth plan proved to be particularly successful. The strategic pillars of this plan are product innovation, omni-guest experience, and market expansion.Product InnovationThroughout fiscal 2019, response to our product offerings was strong as we continued to grow our core product categories, expand our merchandise range, and deliver new innovation through our Science of Feel development platform. Momentum continued in both our men's and women's pant category, and we continued to expand the important categories of bras and outerwear. In men's, one of our key growth areas, revenue increased 34% in 2019. We also moved beyond test phase with our new assortment of selfcare personal-care products. We rolled out our initial assortment to 50 stores and online. Omni-Guest ExperiencePerformance was strong across both our company-operated store and direct to consumer channels in fiscal 2019, with comparable store sales increasing 9% and direct to consumer net revenue growing 35%, each based on a shifted calendar. In fiscal 2019 we began to engage with our guests in new ways. We began testing a new membership program, with four markets tested in fiscal 2019. We also opened and began testing our first two fully experiential stores in 2019, one in the Lincoln Park neighborhood of Chicago and the second at the Mall of America near Minneapolis. These stores were designed to offer dedicated studio space for sweat classes and meditation, locker rooms, healthy foods, and an elevated shopping experience. In fiscal 2019 we continued to host unique events in North America and in our international markets. In addition to our SeaWheeze half marathon and festival in Vancouver, we hosted 10K races in Toronto, Edmonton, and San Diego, our first in the United States. In Europe, we held Sweatlife festivals in London, Paris, and Berlin, and in Mainland China, we hosted our 4th annual Unroll China event. These festivals and events brought together guests, educators, ambassadors, and other members of the local community to engage in sweat classes, yoga, personal development, and meditation.20Table of ContentsMarket ExpansionIn fiscal 2019, we continued to expand our presence both in North America and in our international markets. During the year, we opened 51 net new company-operated stores, including 19 in North America, 24 in Asia Pacific, and eight in Europe. We expanded into two new markets in Europe during the year, the Netherlands and Norway. We also launched local market e-commerce sites in Germany and France. In Asia, we opened our first stores in Malaysia and launched a local e-commerce site in Japan.We also expanded our seasonal store strategy in fiscal 2019 with approximately 80 seasonal stores in operation for some period of time during the year. These stores allowed us to better cater to our guests in select markets, particularly during the holidays, while also helping introduce new guests to our brand. For fiscal 2019, our business in North America grew 20%, while total growth in our international markets was 32%.Coronavirus (COVID-19)The outbreak of the COVID-19 coronavirus has been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization and continues to spread in the United States, Canada, and in many other countries globally. The spread of COVID-19 has caused public health officials to recommend precautions to mitigate the spread of the virus, especially when congregating in heavily populated areas, such as malls and lifestyle centers. Government authorities in certain markets in which we operate have also issued orders that require the closure of non-essential businesses and people to remain at home. We have taken actions to close certain retail locations and to reduce operating hours, and we continue to monitor the situation and work closely with local authorities to prioritize the safety of our people and guests. In February 2020, we temporarily closed all of our retail locations in Mainland China. All but one of these locations have since reopened. In March 2020, we temporarily closed all of our retail locations in North America, Europe, Malaysia, New Zealand, and we temporarily closed our distribution center in Sumner, WA. These locations currently remain closed.There is significant uncertainty regarding the extent and duration of the impact that the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic will have on the demand for our products and our supply chain. We expect our sales growth trends to experience a meaningful deterioration from those achieved in fiscal 2019 and to experience a material adverse impact on our fiscal 2020 results. The extent to which COVID-19 impacts our results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information that may emerge concerning the severity of COVID-19 and the actions taken to contain it or treat its impact. We remain confident in the long-term growth opportunities and our Power of Three growth plan and believe that we have sufficient cash and cash equivalents, and available capacity under our revolving credit facilities, to meet our liquidity needs. As of February 2, 2020, we had cash and cash equivalents of $1.1 billion and the capacity under our committed revolving credit facility was $398.2 million.Financial HighlightsThe summary below provides both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. The adjusted financial measures for fiscal 2018 exclude the amounts recognized in connection with U.S. tax reform and taxes on the repatriation of foreign earnings.For the fiscal year ended February 2, 2020, compared to the fiscal year ended February 3, 2019:•Net revenue increased 21% to $4.0 billion. On a constant dollar basis, net revenue increased 22%.•Total comparable sales, which includes comparable store sales and direct to consumer, increased 17%. On a constant dollar basis, total comparable sales increased 18%.–Comparable store sales increased 9%, or increased 10% on a constant dollar basis.–Direct to consumer net revenue increased 35%, or increased 35% on a constant dollar basis.•Gross profit increased 22% to $2.2 billion.•Gross margin increased 70 basis points to 55.9%.•Income from operations increased 26% to $889.1 million. •Operating margin increased 80 basis points to 22.3%. •Income tax expense increased 9% to $251.8 million. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2019 was 28.1% compared to 32.4% for fiscal 2018. The adjusted effective tax rate was 28.0% for fiscal 2018.21Table of Contents•Diluted earnings per share were $4.93 for fiscal 2019 compared to $3.61 in fiscal 2018. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $3.84 for fiscal 2018.Due to the 53rd week in fiscal 2018, comparable sales are calculated on a one week shifted basis such that the 52 weeks ended February 2, 2020 are compared to the 52 weeks ended February 3, 2019 rather than January 27, 2019.Refer to the non-GAAP reconciliation tables contained in the ""Non-GAAP Financial Measures"" section of this ""Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations"" for reconciliations between constant dollar changes in net revenue, total comparable sales, comparable store sales, and direct to consumer net revenue, and adjusted income tax expense, effective tax rates, and diluted earnings per share, and the most directly comparable measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.GeneralNet revenue is comprised of company-operated store sales, direct to consumer sales through www.lululemon.com, other country and region specific websites, and mobile apps, including mobile apps on in-store devices that allow demand to be fulfilled via our distribution centers, and other net revenue, which includes outlet sales, sales from temporary locations, sales to wholesale accounts, license and supply arrangement net revenue which consists of royalties as well as sales of our products to licensees, and warehouse sales.Cost of goods sold includes the cost of purchased merchandise, including freight, duty, and nonrefundable taxes incurred in delivering the goods to our distribution centers. It also includes occupancy costs and depreciation expense for our company-operated store locations, all costs incurred in operating our distribution centers and production, design, distribution, and merchandise departments, hemming, shrink, and inventory provision expense. The primary drivers of the costs of individual products are the costs of raw materials and labor in the countries where we source our merchandise.Selling, general and administrative expenses consist of all operating costs not otherwise included in cost of goods sold.Income tax expense depends on the statutory tax rates in the countries where we sell our products and the proportion of taxable income earned in those jurisdictions. To the extent the relative proportion of taxable income in the jurisdictions fluctuates, or the tax legislation in the respective jurisdictions changes, so will our effective tax rate. We also anticipate that, in the future, we may start to sell our products through retail locations in countries in which we have not yet operated, in which case, we would become subject to taxation based on the foreign statutory rates in the countries where these sales take place and our effective tax rate could fluctuate accordingly. In addition, increases in our Canadian net assets may result in an increase to our effective tax rate due to Canadian withholding taxes that could be payable on future repatriations from our Canadian subsidiaries to the extent that they are not able to be made as a return of capital.Results of OperationsThe following tables summarize key components of our results of operations for the periods indicated, both in dollars and as a percentage of net revenue: Fiscal Year Ended February 2, 2020 February 3, 2019 February 2, 2020 February 3, 2019 (In thousands) (Percentages)Net revenue $3,979,296 $3,288,319 100.0% 100.0%Cost of goods sold 1,755,910 1,472,032 44.1 44.8Gross profit 2,223,386 1,816,287 55.9 55.2Selling, general and administrative expenses 1,334,276 1,110,451 33.5 33.8Income from operations 889,110 705,836 22.3 21.5Other income (expense), net 8,283 9,414 0.2 0.3Income before income tax expense 897,393 715,250 22.6 21.8Income tax expense 251,797 231,449 6.3 7.0Net income $645,596 $483,801 16.2% 14.7%22Table of ContentsComparison of Fiscal 2019 to Fiscal 2018 Net RevenueNet revenue increased $691.0 million, or 21%, to $4.0 billion in fiscal 2019 from $3.3 billion in fiscal 2018. On a constant dollar basis, assuming the average exchange rates in fiscal 2019 remained constant with the average exchange rates in fiscal 2018, net revenue increased $718.5 million, or 22%.The increase in net revenue was primarily due to increased direct to consumer net revenue, net revenue generated by new company-operated stores, and an increase in comparable store sales.Based on a shifted calendar, total comparable sales, which includes comparable store sales and direct to consumer, increased 17% in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018. Total comparable sales increased 18% on a constant dollar basis.Net revenue on a segment basis for fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018 is summarized below. The percentages are presented as a percentage of total net revenue.

The following contributed to the increase in net revenue from our company-operated stores segment:•Net revenue from company-operated stores we opened or significantly expanded subsequent to February 3, 2019, and are therefore not included in comparable store sales, increased net revenue by $238.5 million. During fiscal 2019 we opened 51 net new company-operated stores, including 24 stores in Asia Pacific, 19 stores in North America, and eight stores in Europe.•Based on a shifted calendar, a comparable store sales increase of 9% in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018. Comparable store sales increased 10% on a constant dollar basis. The increase in comparable store sales was primarily a result of increased store traffic and improved conversion rates.We generated net revenue of $32.7 million in the 53rd week of fiscal 2018 from our company-operated stores segment. Direct to Consumer. Net revenue from our direct to consumer segment increased $279.0 million to $1.1 billion in fiscal 2019 from $858.9 million in fiscal 2018. We generated net revenue of $20.3 million in the 53rd week of fiscal 2018 from our direct to consumer segment. Based on a shifted calendar, direct to consumer net revenue increased 35%, or increased 35% on a constant dollar basis. The increase in net revenue from our direct to consumer segment was primarily the result of increased traffic on our e-commerce websites and improved conversion rates, partially offset by a decrease in dollar value per transaction. Other. Net revenue from our other segment increased $37.3 million, or 12%, to $340.4 million in fiscal 2019 from $303.1 million in fiscal 2018. This increase was primarily the result of an increase in net revenue from sales to wholesale accounts, and an increased number of temporary locations, including seasonal stores, open during fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018. Gross ProfitGross profit increased $407.1 million, or 22%, to $2.2 billion in fiscal 2019 from $1.8 billion in fiscal 2018.Gross profit as a percentage of net revenue, or gross margin, increased 70 basis points, to 55.9% in fiscal 2019 from 55.2% in fiscal 2018. The increase in gross margin was primarily the result of an increase in product margin of 110 basis points, which was primarily due to lower product costs, a favorable mix of higher margin product, and lower markdowns.This was partially offset by an increase in costs as a percentage of revenue related to our distribution centers and our product departments of 30 basis points, an increase in occupancy and depreciation costs as a percentage of revenue of 10 basis points, and an unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates of 10 basis points.23Table of ContentsSelling, General and Administrative ExpensesSelling, general and administrative expenses increased $223.8 million, or 20%, to $1.3 billion in fiscal 2019 from $1.1 billion in fiscal 2018. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to:•an increase in costs related to our operating channels of $136.6 million, comprised of:–an increase in employee costs of $64.7 million primarily from a growth in labor hours and benefits, mainly associated with new company-operated stores and other new operating locations, and due to higher incentive compensation expenses;–an increase in variable costs of $49.2 million primarily due to an increase in distribution costs, credit card fees, and packaging costs as a result of increased net revenue; and–an increase in other costs of $22.8 million primarily due to increases in digital marketing expenses, information technology costs, security, and other costs associated with our operating locations;•an increase in head office costs of $84.3 million, comprised of:–an increase in employee costs of $43.0 million primarily due to increased incentive and stock-based compensation expense and due to increased wages, primarily from additional employees to support the growth in our business; and–an increase in other costs of $41.3 million primarily due to increases in depreciation, information technology costs, professional fees, brand and community costs, and other head office costs; and•an increase in net foreign exchange and derivative revaluation losses of $2.9 million. There were net foreign exchange and derivative revaluation losses of $1.5 million in fiscal 2019 compared to net foreign exchange revaluation gains of $1.4 million in fiscal 2018.As a percentage of net revenue, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 30 basis points, to 33.5% in fiscal 2019 from 33.8% in fiscal 2018.Income from OperationsIncome from operations increased $183.3 million, or 26%, to $889.1 million in fiscal 2019 from $705.8 million in fiscal 2018. Operating margin increased 80 basis points to 22.3% compared to 21.5% in fiscal 2018.On a segment basis, we determine income from operations without taking into account our general corporate expenses.Segmented income from operations before general corporate expenses for fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018 is summarized below and is expressed in dollar amounts. The percentages are presented as a percentage of net revenue of the respective operating segments. Fiscal Years Ended February 2, 2020 and February 3, 2019 2019 2018 2019 2018 (In thousands) (Percentages)Segmented income from operations: Company-operated stores $689,339 $575,536 27.6% 27.1%Direct to consumer 482,368 354,107 42.4 41.2Other 72,559 62,558 21.3 20.6 1,244,266 992,201 General corporate expenses 355,156 286,365 Income from operations $889,110 $705,836 Company-Operated Stores. Income from operations from our company-operated stores segment increased $113.8 million, or 20%, to $689.3 million for fiscal 2019 from $575.5 million for fiscal 2018. The increase was primarily the result of increased gross profit of $199.5 million which was primarily due to increased net revenue and higher gross margin. This was partially offset by an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses, primarily due to increased employee costs, increased store operating expenses including higher credit card fees, distribution costs, and packaging costs as a result of higher net revenue, and due to increased security, repairs and maintenance costs, and information technology costs. Income from operations as a percentage of company-operated stores net revenue increased by 50 basis points, primarily due to leverage on selling, general and administrative expenses and an increase in gross margin.24Table of ContentsDirect to Consumer. Income from operations from our direct to consumer segment increased $128.3 million, or 36%, to $482.4 million in fiscal 2019 from $354.1 million in fiscal 2018. The increase was primarily the result of increased gross profit of $194.0 million which was primarily due to increased net revenue and higher gross margin. This was partially offset by an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses primarily due to higher variable costs including distribution costs, credit card fees, and packaging costs as a result of higher net revenue, as well as higher digital marketing expenses, information technology costs, and employee costs. Income from operations as a percentage of direct to consumer net revenue has increased by 120 basis points, primarily due to an increase in gross margin, partially offset by deleverage on selling, general and administrative expenses.Other. Other income from operations increased $10.0 million, or 16%, to $72.6 million in fiscal 2019 from $62.6 million in fiscal 2018. The increase was primarily the result of increased gross profit of $13.6 million which was primarily due to increased net revenue. The increase in gross profit was partially offset by an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses, including increased employee costs, increased operating expenses including higher credit card fees and higher distribution costs as a result of higher net revenue, and due to higher repairs and maintenance costs and information technology costs. Income from operations as a percentage of other net revenue increased 70 basis points, primarily due to leverage on selling, general and administrative expenses, partially offset by a decrease in gross margin.General Corporate Expenses. General corporate expenses increased $68.8 million, or 24%, to $355.2 million in fiscal 2019 from $286.4 million in fiscal 2018. This increase was primarily due to increases in head office employee costs, depreciation, brand and community costs, information technology costs, professional fees, and an increase in net foreign exchange and derivative losses of $2.9 million. We expect general corporate expenses to continue to increase in future years as we grow our overall business and require increased efforts at our head office to support our company-operated stores, direct to consumer and other segments.Other Income (Expense), NetThere was net other income of $8.3 million in fiscal 2019 compared to $9.4 million in fiscal 2018. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in net interest income, primarily from lower cash balances during the majority of fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018. The decrease in net other income was partially offset by a decrease in interest expense, primarily the result of borrowings on our North American revolving credit facility during fiscal 2018. We did not have any borrowings on our revolving credit facilities during fiscal 2019.Income Tax ExpenseIncome tax expense increased $20.3 million, or 9%, to $251.8 million in fiscal 2019 from $231.4 million in fiscal 2018.U.S. tax reform was enacted on December 22, 2017 and introduced significant changes to U.S. income tax law. We completed the accounting for the income tax effects of U.S. tax reform during fiscal 2018. This resulted in the recognition of an additional tax expense of $7.5 million related to the mandatory one-time transition tax on the deemed repatriation of accumulated undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries.In fiscal 2018, we also completed our assessment of the impact that U.S. tax reform has upon repatriation taxes, our reinvestment plans, and the most efficient means of deploying our capital resources globally. We concluded that the net investment in a Canadian subsidiary in excess of the amounts necessary to sustain our business operations would no longer be indefinitely reinvested and $778.9 million was repatriated from that subsidiary. This resulted in the recognition of a tax expense of $23.7 million in fiscal 2018.Further information on the adjustments recognized in fiscal 2018 is outlined in Note 15 to the audited consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this report. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2019 was 28.1% compared to 32.4% for fiscal 2018. The effective tax rate excluding the above tax adjustments related to U.S. tax reform was 28.0% for fiscal 2018. The increase in the effective tax rate compared to our adjusted effective tax rate in the prior year was primarily due to accruals for repatriation taxes on unremitted earnings and true-ups upon filing of tax returns. This was partially offset by a reduction in non-deductible stock-based compensation expense.Net IncomeNet income increased $161.8 million, or 33%, to $645.6 million in fiscal 2019 from $483.8 million in fiscal 2018. The increase in net income in fiscal 2019 was primarily due to an increase in gross profit of $407.1 million, partially offset by an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses of $223.8 million, an increase in income tax expense of $20.3 million, and a decrease in other income (expense), net of $1.1 million.25Table of ContentsComparable SalesWe separately track comparable store sales, which reflect net revenue from company-operated stores that have been open, or open after being significantly expanded, for at least 12 full fiscal months. Net revenue from a store is included in comparable store sales beginning with the first fiscal month for which the store has a full fiscal month of sales in the prior year. Comparable store sales exclude sales from new stores that have not been open for at least 12 full fiscal months, from stores which have not been in their significantly expanded space for at least 12 full fiscal months, and from stores which have been temporarily relocated for renovations or temporarily closed for over 30 days. Comparable store sales also exclude sales from direct to consumer, outlets, temporary locations, wholesale accounts, through license and supply arrangements, warehouse sales, and sales from company-operated stores that we have closed.We use comparable store sales to assess the performance of our existing stores. It allows us to monitor the performance of our business without the impact of recently opened or expanded stores. We believe that investors would similarly find this metric useful in assessing the performance of our business. Total comparable sales combines comparable store sales and direct to consumer sales. We are evolving towards an omni-channel approach to support the shopping behavior of our guests. This involves country and region specific websites, mobile apps, including mobile apps on in-store devices that allow demand to be fulfilled via our distribution centers, social media, product notification emails, and online order fulfillment through stores. Total comparable sales is an increasingly important metric to us as it allows us to evaluate the performance of our business from an omni-channel perspective. We therefore believe that reporting total comparable sales with comparable store sales and direct to consumer sales combined provides a relevant performance metric to investors. Various factors affect comparable sales, including:•the location of new stores relative to existing stores;•consumer preferences, buying trends, foot traffic in the malls in which our stores are located, and overall economic trends;•our ability to anticipate and respond effectively to customer preferences for technical athletic apparel;•competition;•changes in our merchandise mix;•pricing;•the timing of our releases of new merchandise and promotional events;•the effectiveness of our marketing efforts;•the design and ease of use of our websites and mobile apps; •the level of customer service that we provide in our stores and on our websites and mobile apps;•our ability to source and distribute products efficiently; and•the number of stores we open, close (including for temporary renovations), and expand in any period.In fiscal years with 53 weeks, the 53rd week of net revenue is excluded from the calculation of comparable sales. In the year following a 53 week year, the prior year period is shifted by one week to compare similar calendar weeks. Opening new stores and expanding existing stores is an important part of our growth strategy. Accordingly, total comparable sales is just one way of assessing the success of our growth strategy insofar as comparable sales do not reflect the performance of stores opened, or significantly expanded, within the last 12 full fiscal months. The comparable sales measures we report may not be equivalent to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresConstant dollar changes in net revenue, total comparable sales, comparable store sales, and direct to consumer net revenue, and the adjusted financial results are non-GAAP financial measures.A constant dollar basis assumes the average foreign exchange rates for the period remained constant with the average foreign exchange rates for the same period of the prior year. We provide constant dollar changes in net revenue, total comparable sales, comparable store sales, and direct to consumer net revenue because we use these measures to understand the underlying growth rate of net revenue excluding the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates. We believe that disclosing 26Table of Contentsthese measures on a constant dollar basis is useful to investors because it enables them to understand the level of growth of our business.Adjusted income tax expense, effective tax rates, and diluted earnings per share exclude the amounts recognized in connection with U.S. tax reform and taxes on repatriation of foreign earnings. We believe these adjusted financial measures are useful to investors in evaluating the trend in our operating performance as the adjustments do not directly relate to our ongoing business operations. Furthermore, we do not believe the adjustments are reflective of our expectations of our future operating performance and believe these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors because of their comparability to our historical information.The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or with greater prominence to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures follows, which includes more detail on the GAAP financial measure that is most directly comparable to each non-GAAP financial measure, and the related reconciliations between these financial measures.Constant dollar changes in net revenueThe below changes in net revenue show the change compared to the corresponding period in the prior year.

Our primary cash needs are capital expenditures for opening new stores and remodeling or relocating existing stores, investing in information technology and making system enhancements, funding working capital requirements, and making other strategic capital investments both in North America and internationally. We may also use cash to repurchase shares of our common stock. Cash and cash equivalents in excess of our needs are held in interest bearing accounts with financial institutions, as well as in money market funds, treasury bills, and term deposits.As of February 2, 2020, our working capital (excluding cash and cash equivalents) was $94.0 million, our cash and cash equivalents were $1.1 billion and our capacity under our committed revolving credit facility was $398.2 million.The following table summarizes our net cash flows provided by and used in operating, investing, and financing activities for the periods indicated: Fiscal Year Ended February 2, 2020 February 3, 2019 (In thousands)Total cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $669,316 $742,779Investing activities (278,408) (242,794)Financing activities (177,173) (590,214)Effect of exchange rate changes on cash (1,550) (18,952)Increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $212,185 $(109,181)Operating ActivitiesCash flows provided by operating activities consist primarily of net income adjusted for certain items including depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense, and the effect of changes in operating assets and liabilities.Net cash provided by operating activities decreased $73.5 million in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018, primarily as a result of the following:•an increase in cash used in operating activities of $306.9 million as a result of changes in operating assets and liabilities, primarily due to the following:–$115.9 million related to income taxes, primarily due to payments for withholding taxes on repatriated foreign earnings, as well as timing of tax installments;–$86.8 million related to accounts payable, primarily due to a change in our payment terms in the prior fiscal year;–$51.0 million related to other prepaid expenses and other current and non-current assets; and28Table of Contents–$45.6 million related to inventory, primarily due to an increase in inventory purchases to support our growth.This was partially offset by an increase of $161.8 million in net income, and an increase of $71.7 million in non-cash expenses primarily related to an increase in depreciation, stock-based compensation, the settlement of derivatives not designated in a hedging relationship, and deferred income taxes.Investing ActivitiesCash flows used in investing activities relate to capital expenditures, the settlement of net investment hedges, and other investing activities. Cash used in investing activities increased $35.6 million, to $278.4 million in fiscal 2019 from $242.8 million in fiscal 2018. Capital expenditures for our company-operated stores segment were $171.5 million and $129.2 million in fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018, respectively. The capital expenditures for our company-operated stores segment in each period were primarily for the remodeling or relocation of certain stores, for opening new company-operated stores, and ongoing store refurbishment. The increase in capital expenditures for our company-operated stores segment was primarily due to an increased amount spent on store remodels and relocations, including our experiential stores. The capital expenditures for our company-operated stores segment also included $44.3 million to open 57 company-operated stores and $27.1 million to open 39 company-operated stores, in fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018 respectively.Capital expenditures for our direct to consumer segment were $15.8 million and $6.4 million in fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018, respectively. The capital expenditures for our direct to consumer segment in fiscal 2019 were primarily related to our new distribution center in Toronto, Canada as well as other information technology infrastructure and system initiatives, and in fiscal 2018 were primarily related to our global and region specific websites as well as mobile apps.Capital expenditures related to corporate activities and other were $95.7 million and $90.2 million in fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018, respectively. The capital expenditures in each fiscal year were primarily related to investments in information technology and business systems, improvements at our head office and other corporate buildings, and for capital expenditures related to opening retail locations other than company-operated stores. Financing ActivitiesCash flows used in financing activities consist primarily of cash used to repurchase shares of our common stock, certain cash flows related to stock-based compensation, and other financing activities. Cash used in financing activities decreased $413.0 million, to $177.2 million in fiscal 2019 from $590.2 million in fiscal 2018. The decrease was primarily the result of a decrease in our stock repurchases.During the fiscal years ended February 2, 2020 and February 3, 2019, 1.1 million and 4.9 million, respectively, were repurchased under the programs at a total cost of $173.4 million and $598.3 million, respectively. During the first quarter of fiscal 2019, we repurchased 1.0 million shares in a private transaction, and during the second quarter of fiscal 2018, we repurchased 3.3 million shares in a private transaction. The other common stock was repurchased in the open market at prevailing market prices, including under plans complying with the provisions of Rule 10b5-1 and Rule 10b-18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, with the timing and actual number of shares repurchased depending upon market conditions, eligibility to trade, and other factors.We believe that our cash and cash equivalent balances, cash generated from operations, and borrowings available to us under our revolving credit facilities will be adequate to meet our liquidity needs and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months. Our cash from operations may be negatively impacted by a decrease in demand for our products as well as the other factors described in ""Item 1A. Risk Factors"". In addition, we may make discretionary capital improvements with respect to our stores, distribution facilities, headquarters, or systems, or we may repurchase shares under an approved stock repurchase program, which we would expect to fund through the use of cash, issuance of debt or equity securities or other external financing sources to the extent we were unable to fund such capital expenditures out of our cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from operations.Revolving Credit FacilitiesNorth America revolving credit facilityOn December 15, 2016, we entered into a credit agreement for $150.0 million under a committed and unsecured five-year revolving credit facility. Bank of America, N.A., is administrative agent and HSBC Bank Canada is the syndication agent and letter of credit issuer, and the lenders party thereto. Borrowings under the revolving credit facility may be made, in U.S. Dollars, Euros, Canadian Dollars, and in other currencies, subject to the approval of the administrative agent and the lenders. Up to $35.0 million of the revolving credit facility is available for the issuance of letters of credit and up to $25.0 million is 29Table of Contentsavailable for the issuance of swing line loans. Commitments under the revolving credit facility may be increased by up to $200.0 million, subject to certain conditions, including the approval of the lenders. Borrowings under the agreement may be prepaid and commitments may be reduced or terminated without premium or penalty (other than customary breakage costs). The principal amount outstanding under the credit agreement, if any, will be due and payable in full on December 15, 2021, subject to provisions that permit us to request a limited number of one year extensions annually. Borrowings made under the revolving credit facility bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at our option, either (a) a rate based on the rates applicable for deposits on the interbank market for U.S. Dollars or the applicable currency in which the borrowings are made (""LIBOR"") or (b) an alternate base rate, plus, in each case, an applicable margin. The applicable margin is determined by reference to a pricing grid, based on the ratio of indebtedness to earnings before interest, tax depreciation, amortization, and rent (""EBITDAR"") and ranges between 1.00%-1.75% for LIBOR loans and 0.00%-0.75% for alternate base rate loans. Additionally, a commitment fee of between 0.125%-0.200%, also determined by reference to the pricing grid, is payable on the average daily unused amounts under the revolving credit facility.The credit agreement contains negative covenants that, among other things and subject to certain exceptions, limit the ability of our subsidiaries to incur indebtedness, incur liens, undergo fundamental changes, make dispositions of all or substantially all of their assets, alter their businesses and enter into agreements limiting subsidiary dividends and distributions. We are also required to maintain a consolidated rent-adjusted leverage ratio of not greater than 3.50:1.00 and we are not permitted to allow the ratio of consolidated EBITDAR to consolidated interest charges (plus rent) to be less than 2.00:1.00. The credit agreement also contains certain customary representations, warranties, affirmative covenants, and events of default (including, among others, an event of default upon the occurrence of a change of control). If an event of default occurs, the credit agreement may be terminated, and the maturity of any outstanding amounts may be accelerated.On June 6, 2018, we entered into Amendment No. 1 to the credit agreement. The Amendment amends the credit agreement to provide for (i) an increase in the aggregate commitments under the unsecured five-year revolving credit facility to $400.0 million, with an increase of the sub-limits for the issuance of letters of credit and extensions of swing line loans to $50.0 million for each, (ii) an increase in the option, subject to certain conditions as set forth in the credit agreement, to request increases in commitments under the revolving facility from $400.0 million to $600.0 million and (iii) an extension in the maturity of the revolving facility from December 15, 2021 to June 6, 2023.In addition, the Amendment decreases the applicable margins for LIBOR loans from 1.00%-1.75% to 1.00%-1.50% and for alternate base rate loans from 0.00%-0.75% to 0.00%-0.50%, reduces the commitment fee on average daily unused amounts under the revolving facility from 0.125%-0.200% to 0.10%-0.20%, and reduces fees for unused letters of credit from 1.00%-1.75% to 1.00%-1.50%.As of February 2, 2020, aside from letters of credit of $1.8 million, we had no other borrowings outstanding under this credit facility.Mainland China revolving credit facilityIn December 2019, the Company entered into an uncommitted and unsecured 130.0 million Chinese Yuan revolving credit facility. The terms are reviewed on an annual basis. The facility includes a revolving loan of up to 100.0 million Chinese Yuan as well as a financial bank guarantee facility of up to 30.0 million Chinese Yuan, or its equivalent in another currency. Loans are available in Chinese Yuan for a period not to exceed 12 months, and interest accrues on them at a rate equal to 105% of the applicable PBOC Benchmark Lending Rate. Guarantees have a commission equal to 1% per annum of the outstanding amount. The Company is required to follow certain covenants. As of February 2, 2020, there were no borrowings outstanding under this credit facility.Contractual Obligations and CommitmentsLeases. We lease certain store and other retail locations, distribution centers, offices, and equipment under non-cancellable operating leases. Our leases generally have initial terms of between five and 15 years, and generally can be extended in five-year increments, if at all. The following table details the Company's future minimum lease payments. Minimum lease commitments exclude variable lease expenses including contingent rent payments, common area maintenance, property taxes, and landlord's insurance. Purchase obligations. The amounts listed for purchase obligations in the table below represent agreements (including open purchase orders) to purchase products and for other expenditures in the ordinary course of business that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms. In some cases, values are subject to change, such as for product purchases throughout the production process. The reported amounts exclude liabilities included in our consolidated balance sheets as of February 2, 2020.30Table of ContentsOne-time transition tax. As outlined in Note 15 to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this report, U.S. tax reform imposed a mandatory transition tax on accumulated foreign subsidiary earnings which have not previously been subject to U.S. income tax. The one-time transition tax is payable over eight years beginning in fiscal 2018. The table below outlines the expected payments due by fiscal year.The following table summarizes our contractual arrangements as of February 2, 2020, and the timing and effect that such commitments are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods: Payments Due by Fiscal Year Total 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 Thereafter (In thousands)Operating leases (minimum rent) $826,096 $152,440 $161,519 $138,188 $111,877 $87,275 $174,797Purchase obligations 346,542 298,039 4,638 4,538 4,538 15,126 19,663One-time transition tax payable 53,302 5,076 5,076 5,076 9,518 12,691 15,865Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsWe enter into standby letters of credit to secure certain of our obligations, including leases, taxes, and duties. As of February 2, 2020, letters of credit totaling $1.8 million had been issued.We have not entered into any transactions, agreements or other contractual arrangements to which an entity unconsolidated with us is a party and under which we have (i) any obligation under a guarantee, (ii) any retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity that serves as credit, liquidity or market risk support to such entity, (iii) any obligation under derivative instruments that are indexed to our shares and classified as equity in our consolidated balance sheets, or (iv) any obligation arising out of a variable interest in any unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit support to us or engages in leasing, hedging or research and development services with us.Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions. Predicting future events is inherently an imprecise activity and, as such, requires the use of judgment. Actual results may vary from our estimates in amounts that may be material to the financial statements. An accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically, could materially impact our consolidated financial statements. We believe that the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements:Revenue Recognition. Net revenue is comprised of company-operated store net revenue, direct to consumer net revenue through websites and mobile apps, including mobile apps on in-store devices that allow demand to be fulfilled via our distribution centers, and other net revenue, which includes revenue from outlets, temporary locations, sales to wholesale accounts, warehouse sales, and license and supply arrangement net revenue, which consists of royalties as well as sales of our products to licensees. All net revenue is reported net of sales taxes collected from customers on behalf of taxing authorities.We record an estimated allowance for sales returns. This allowance is calculated based on a history of actual returns, estimated future returns, and any significant future known, or anticipated, events. Consideration of these factors results in an estimated allowance for sales returns and an asset for estimated returned inventory. Our standard terms for retail sales limit returns to approximately 30 days after sale; however, we accept returns after 30 days where the product fails to meet our guests' quality expectations.Proceeds from the sale of gift cards are initially deferred and recognized within ""Unredeemed gift card liability"" on the consolidated balance sheets, and are recognized as revenue when tendered for payment. To the extent there is no requirement to remit unclaimed card balances to government agencies, an estimate of the gift card balances that will never be redeemed is recognized as revenue in proportion to gift cards which have been redeemed. The estimate of gift cards that will never be redeemed is based on the historic trend of unredeemed cards. Inventory provisions. Inventory is valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value. We periodically review our inventories and make a provision as necessary to appropriately value goods that are obsolete, have quality issues, or are damaged. The amount of the provision is equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and its net realizable value 31Table of Contentsbased upon assumptions about product quality, damages, future demand, selling prices, and market conditions. If changes in market conditions result in reductions in the estimated net realizable value of our inventory below our previous estimate, we would increase our reserve in the period in which we made such a determination.Property and Equipment. Property and equipment are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation. Buildings are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the expected useful life of the asset, which is individually assessed, and estimated to be up to 20 years. Leasehold improvements are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the lesser of the length of the lease and the estimated useful life of the assets, up to a maximum of five years. All other property and equipment is depreciated using the declining balance method as follows: Furniture and fixtures 20%Computer hardware and software 20% - 30%Equipment and vehicles 30%Changes in circumstances, such as technological advances, can result in differences between the actual and estimated useful lives. In those cases where we determine that the useful life of a long-lived asset should be shortened, we increase depreciation expense over the remaining useful life to depreciate the asset's net book value to its estimated salvage value.Long-lived assets, including intangible assets with finite useful lives are evaluated for impairment when the occurrence of events or changes in circumstances indicates that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable as measured by comparing their net book value to the undiscounted estimated future cash flows generated by their use and eventual disposition. Impaired assets are recorded at fair value, determined principally by the present value of the estimated future cash flows expected from their use and eventual disposition. Deferred taxes on undistributed net investment of foreign subsidiaries. We have not recognized U.S. state income taxes and foreign withholding taxes on the net investment in our subsidiaries which we have determined to be indefinitely reinvested. This determination is based on the cash flow projections and operational and fiscal objectives of each of our foreign subsidiaries. Such estimates are inherently imprecise since many assumptions utilized in the projections are subject to revision in the future. For the portion of our net investment in our Canadian subsidiaries that are not indefinitely reinvested, we have recorded a deferred tax liability for the taxes which would be due upon repatriation. For distributions made by our Canadian subsidiaries, the amount of tax payable is partially dependent on how the repatriation transactions are made. The deferred tax liability has been recorded on the basis that we would choose to make the repatriation transactions in the most tax efficient manner. Specifically, to the extent that the Canadian subsidiaries have sufficient paid-up-capital, any such distributions would be characterized for Canadian tax purposes as a return of capital, rather than as a dividend, and would not be subject to Canadian withholding tax.As of February 2, 2020, the paid-up-capital balance of the Canadian subsidiaries for tax purposes was $1.5 billion. The net investment in our Canadian subsidiaries was $1.3 billion, of which $0.8 billion was determined to be indefinitely reinvested. The Canadian subsidiaries have sufficient paid-up-capital such that we could choose to repatriate the portion of our net investment that is not indefinitely reinvested without paying Canadian withholding tax. Deferred tax liabilities of $1.5 million have been recognized in relation to the portion of our net investment in our Canadian subsidiaries that is not indefinitely reinvested, principally representing the U.S. state income taxes which would be due upon repatriation. The unrecognized deferred tax liability on the indefinitely reinvested amount is approximately $2.3 million.Stock-Based Compensation. We account for stock-based compensation using the fair value method. The fair value of awards granted is estimated at the date of grant. Awards settled in cash or common stock at the election of the employee are remeasured to fair value at the end of each reporting period until settlement. The employee compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. For awards with service and/or performance conditions, the amount of compensation expense recognized is based on the number of awards that are expected to vest. The estimation of the number of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment, and to the extent actual results differ from our estimates, such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised. We consider several factors when estimating the number of awards which are expected to vest, including, future profit forecasts, types of awards, size of option holder group, and anticipated employee retention and estimated expected forfeitures. Actual results may differ substantially from these estimates.32Table of ContentsThe calculation of the grant-date fair value of stock options requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions, including, stock price volatility, and the expected life of the options. We evaluate and revise these estimates and assumptions as necessary, to reflect market conditions and our historical experience. The expected term of the options is based upon historical experience of similar awards, giving consideration to expectations of future employee behavior. Expected volatility is based upon the historical volatility of our common stock for the period corresponding with the expected term of the options. In the future, the expected volatility and expected term may change which could substantially change the grant-date fair value of future awards of stock options and, ultimately, the expense we record.Contingencies. In the ordinary course of business, we are involved in legal proceedings regarding contractual and employment relationships and a variety of other matters. We record contingent liabilities resulting from claims against us, when a loss is assessed to be probable and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable. Assessing probability of loss and estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors, including in some cases judgments about the potential actions of third-party claimants and courts. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKForeign Currency Exchange Risk. The functional currency of our foreign subsidiaries is generally the applicable local currency. Our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars. Therefore, the net revenue, expenses, assets, and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries are translated from their functional currencies into U.S. dollars. Fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar affect the reported amounts of net revenue, expenses, assets, and liabilities. Foreign exchange differences which arise on translation of our foreign subsidiaries' balance sheets into U.S. dollars are recorded as a foreign currency translation adjustment in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss within stockholders' equity.We also have exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates associated with transactions which are undertaken by our subsidiaries in currencies other than their functional currency. Such transactions include intercompany transactions and inventory purchases denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the purchasing entity. As a result, we have been impacted by changes in exchange rates and may be impacted for the foreseeable future. The potential impact of currency fluctuation increases as our international expansion increases.As of February 2, 2020, we had certain forward currency contracts outstanding in order to hedge a portion of the foreign currency exposure that arises on translation of a Canadian subsidiary into U.S. dollars. We also had certain forward currency contracts outstanding in an effort to reduce our exposure to the foreign exchange revaluation gains and losses that are recognized by our Canadian and Chinese subsidiaries on U.S. dollar denominated monetary assets and liabilities. Please refer to Note 12 to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this report for further information, including details of the notional amounts outstanding.In the future, in an effort to reduce foreign exchange risks, we may enter into further derivative financial instruments including hedging additional currency pairs. We do not, and do not intend to, engage in the practice of trading derivative securities for profit.We currently generate a significant portion of our net revenue and incur a significant portion of our expenses in Canada. We also hold a significant portion of our net assets in Canada. The reporting currency for our consolidated financial statements is the U.S. dollar. A strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Canadian dollar results in:•the following impacts to the consolidated statements of operations:–a decrease in our net revenue upon translation of the sales made by our Canadian operations into U.S. dollars for the purposes of consolidation;–a decrease in our selling, general and administrative expenses incurred by our Canadian operations upon translation into U.S. dollars for the purposes of consolidation;–foreign exchange revaluation gains by our Canadian subsidiaries on U.S. dollar denominated monetary assets and liabilities; and–derivative valuation losses on forward currency contracts not designated in a hedging relationship;•the following impacts to the consolidated balance sheets:–a decrease in the foreign currency translation adjustment which arises on the translation of our Canadian subsidiaries' balance sheets into U.S. dollars; and–an increase in the foreign currency translation adjustment from derivative valuation losses on forward currency contracts, entered into as net investment hedges of a Canadian subsidiary.33Table of ContentsDuring fiscal 2019, the change in the relative value of the U.S. dollar against the Canadian dollar resulted in a $4.6 million increase in accumulated other comprehensive loss within stockholders' equity. During fiscal 2018, the change in the relative value of the U.S. dollar against the Canadian dollar resulted in a $83.2 million increase in accumulated other comprehensive loss within stockholders' equity.A 10% appreciation in the relative value of the U.S. dollar against the Canadian dollar compared to the exchange rates in effect for fiscal 2019 would have resulted in lower income from operations of approximately $4.6 million in fiscal 2019. This assumes a consistent 10% appreciation in the U.S. dollar against the Canadian dollar throughout the fiscal year. The timing of changes in the relative value of the U.S. dollar combined with the seasonal nature of our business, can affect the magnitude of the impact that fluctuations in foreign exchange rates have on our income from operations.Interest Rate Risk. Our committed revolving credit facility provides us with available borrowings in an amount up to $400.0 million in the aggregate. Because our revolving credit facilities bear interest at a variable rate, we will be exposed to market risks relating to changes in interest rates, if we have a meaningful outstanding balance. As of February 2, 2020, aside from letters of credit of $1.8 million, we had no other borrowings outstanding under these credit facilities. We currently do not engage in any interest rate hedging activity and currently have no intention to do so. However, in the future, if we have a meaningful outstanding balance under our revolving facility, in an effort to mitigate losses associated with these risks, we may at times enter into derivative financial instruments, although we have not historically done so. These may take the form of forward contracts, option contracts, or interest rate swaps. We do not, and do not intend to, engage in the practice of trading derivative securities for profit.Our cash and cash equivalent balances are held in the form of cash on hand, bank balances, short-term deposits and treasury bills with original maturities of three months or less, and in money market funds. We do not believe these balances are subject to material interest rate risk.Credit Risk. We have cash on deposit with various large, reputable financial institutions and have invested in U.S. and Canadian Treasury Bills, and in AAA-rated money market funds. The amount of cash and cash equivalents held with certain financial institutions exceeds government-insured limits. We are also exposed to credit-related losses in the event of nonperformance by the financial institutions that are counterparties to our forward currency contracts. The credit risk amount is our unrealized gains on our derivative instruments, based on foreign currency rates at the time of nonperformance. We have not experienced any losses related to these items, and we believe credit risk to be minimal. We seek to minimize our credit risk by entering into transactions with credit worthy and reputable financial institutions and by monitoring the credit standing of the financial institutions with whom we transact. We seek to limit the amount of exposure with any one counterparty.InflationInflationary factors such as increases in the cost of our product and overhead costs may adversely affect our operating results. Although we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations to date, a high rate of inflation in the future may have an adverse effect on our ability to maintain current levels of gross margin and selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenue if the selling prices of our products do not increase with these increased costs.34Table of Contents",2023-12-30 21:53:23.269899

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSManagement's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Components of management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations include:•Overview •Financial Highlights •Results of Operations •Comparison of 2020 to 2019•Comparable Store Sales and Total Comparable Sales•Non-GAAP Financial Measures•Liquidity and Capital Resources•Revolving Credit Facilities•Contractual Obligations and Commitments•Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements•Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesOur fiscal year ends on the Sunday closest to January 31 of the following year, typically resulting in a 52-week year, but occasionally giving rise to an additional week, resulting in a 53-week year. Fiscal 2020 and 2019 were each 52-week years. This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements based on current expectations that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions, such as our plans, objectives, expectations, and intentions included in the ""Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements."" Our actual results and the timing of events may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those described in the ""Item 1A. Risk Factors"" section and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.We disclose material non-public information through one or more of the following channels: our investor relations website (http://investor.lululemon.com/), the social media channels identified on our investor relations website, press releases, SEC filings, public conference calls, and webcasts.OverviewFiscal 2020 was a year in which we had to adapt our priorities, and evolve our strategies, to navigate the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic and begin to more impactfully address systemic inequities in our society.We put three foundational principles in place to help guide us through the pandemic. These principles are: 1) protect our people to ensure their health, safety, and well-being, 2) make balanced decisions including investing in our digital and omni capabilities while tightly managing discretionary expenses, and 3) continue to invest in our future. We completed our first acquisition in 2020, with our purchase of MIRROR. MIRROR bolsters our digital sweatlife offerings and brings immersive and personalized at-home sweat and mindfulness solutions to new and existing lululemon guests.In addition, we established IDEA – our commitment to Inclusion, Diversity, Equity, and Action – to help drive lasting change both within our company and the communities in which we operate. In October 2020, we released our Impact Agenda detailing our strategies to become a more sustainable and equitable business, to minimize our environmental impact, and to accelerate positive change both internally and externally. The Power of ThreeDespite the global pandemic, we remain committed to our Power of Three growth plan and the targets contemplated by this plan which include a doubling of our men's business, a doubling of our e-commerce business, and a quadrupling of our international business by 2023 from levels realized in 2018. Due to a shift towards online shopping as a result of COVID-19, we exceeded our e-commerce goal this year.In addition to the growth targets, the three strategic pillars of the plan also remain unchanged and include: product innovation, omni-guest experience, and market expansion.23Table of ContentsProduct InnovationWe continued to leverage our Science of Feel development platform and brought innovations to our guests including a relaunch of our Everlux fabric and an expansion of our Align franchise into tops. We also brought newness into our bra offering and expanded our On the Move assortment. We introduced more inclusive sizing into our core women's styles in 2020 with additional styles to be added in 2021. In men's, our guests responded well to shorts, sweats, hoodies, and joggers as they adapted their wardrobes to working and sweating from home.Omni-Guest ExperienceThe COVID-19 pandemic impacted the way guests interacted with our brand in 2020. Temporary store closures, social distancing requirements, and other actions taken within our stores to keep our guests and employees safe, contributed to a decline in store traffic relative to 2019. Revenue in stores decreased 34%. However, this was offset by significant strength in our e-commerce business. We invested in IT infrastructure, fulfillment capacity, and increased the number of educators assisting guests in our Guest Education Center, including an online digital educator experience to provide a more personalized shopping experience. In addition, we used our social channels to engage with our guests by offering ambassador-led digital sweat sessions, meditation classes, and other recovery and well-being tools. Revenue in our e-commerce channel increased 101% in 2020.In 2020, as it was safe to welcome guests back into our stores, we launched several initiatives to enhance the in-store experience. We adapted our Buy Online Pick-up In-store capability to allow guests to pick-up their purchases at the door of the store or at curbside, we implemented virtual waitlist capabilities so that guests did not have to physically wait in line to enter stores operating under strict capacity constraints, and we offered appointment shopping in-store.Market ExpansionWe continued to expand our presence both in North America and in our international markets. During the year, we opened 30 net new company-operated stores, including 18 stores in Asia Pacific, nine stores in North America, and three stores in Europe. We also expanded our seasonal store strategy in 2020 with over 100 seasonal stores in operation for some period of time during the year. These stores allowed us to better cater to our guests in select markets, while also helping introduce new guests to our brand. In addition, in the fourth quarter, we opened 11 of these stores in close proximity to permanent lululemon stores. Having two stores in select locations, where locally mandated capacity constraints were contributing to long wait times, allowed guests quicker and easier access to our in-store shopping experience. For 2020, our business in North America increased 8%, while total growth in our international markets was 31%.COVID-19 PandemicThe outbreak of the COVID-19 coronavirus was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020 and it has caused governments and public health officials to impose restrictions and to recommend precautions to mitigate the spread of the virus.Throughout the pandemic we have prioritized the safety of our employees and guests. In February and March, we temporarily closed all of our retail locations in Mainland China, North America, Europe, and certain countries in Asia Pacific. Our retail locations in Mainland China reopened during the first quarter of 2020, and our retail locations in other markets began reopening during the second quarter of 2020. Almost all locations were open during the third quarter of 2020, and while most of our retail locations have remained open since then, certain locations have temporarily closed based on government and health authority guidance in those markets. Our distribution centers and most of our open retail locations are operating with restrictive and precautionary measures in place such as reduced operating hours, physical distancing, enhanced cleaning and sanitation, and limited occupancy levels.Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, guest shopping preferences were shifting towards digital platforms and we had been investing in our websites, mobile apps, and omni-channel capabilities. We believe that the COVID-19 pandemic further shifted guest shopping behaviour and we saw significant increases in traffic to our websites and digital apps. This increased traffic contributed to the significant growth in our direct to consumer net revenue in 2020. While we expect our direct to consumer business to grow, we expect the year over year growth rate in direct to consumer net revenue to moderate in 2021. 24Table of ContentsThe COVID-19 pandemic had a material adverse impact on our results of operations for 2020 and there remains significant uncertainty regarding the extent and duration of the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic will have on our operations. Continued proliferation of the virus, resurgence, or the emergence of new variants may result in further or prolonged closures of our retail locations and distribution centers, reduce operating hours, interrupt our supply chain, cause changes in guest behavior, and reduce discretionary spending. Such factors are beyond our control and could elicit further actions and recommendations from governments and public health authorities.We remain confident in the long-term growth opportunities and our Power of Three growth plan and believe that we have sufficient cash and cash equivalents, and available capacity under our committed revolving credit facility, to meet our liquidity needs. As of January 31, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents of $1.2 billion and the capacity under our committed revolving credit facility was $397.6 million.Financial HighlightsThe summary below compares 2020 to 2019:•Net revenue increased 11% to $4.4 billion. On a constant dollar basis, net revenue increased 10%.•Company-operated stores net revenue decreased 34% to $1.7 billion.•Direct to consumer net revenue increased 101% to $2.3 billion, or increased 101% on a constant dollar basis.•Gross profit increased 11% to $2.5 billion.•Gross margin increased 10 basis points to 56.0%.•Acquisition-related expenses of $29.8 million were recognized.•Income from operations decreased 8% to $820.0 million. •Operating margin decreased 370 basis points to 18.6%. •Income tax expense decreased 8% to $230.4 million. Our effective tax rate was 28.1% for each of 2020 and 2019.•Diluted earnings per share were $4.50 for 2020 compared to $4.93 in 2019. This includes $26.7 million of after-tax costs related to the MIRROR acquisition, which reduced diluted earnings per share by $0.20 in 2020.Refer to the non-GAAP reconciliation tables contained in the ""Non-GAAP Financial Measures"" section of this ""Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations"" for reconciliations between constant dollar changes in net revenue and direct to consumer net revenue, and the most directly comparable measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.Results of OperationsThe following table summarizes key components of our results of operations for the periods indicated: 2020201920202019 (In thousands)(Percentage of revenue)Net revenue$4,401,879 $3,979,296 100.0 %100.0 %Cost of goods sold1,937,888 1,755,910 44.0 44.1 Gross profit2,463,991 2,223,386 56.0 55.9 Selling, general and administrative expenses1,609,003 1,334,247 36.6 33.5 Amortization of intangible assets5,160 29 0.1 — Acquisition-related expenses29,842 — 0.7 — Income from operations819,986 889,110 18.6 22.3 Other income (expense), net(636)8,283 — 0.2 Income before income tax expense819,350 897,393 18.6 22.6 Income tax expense230,437 251,797 5.2 6.3 Net income$588,913 $645,596 13.4 %16.2 %25Table of ContentsComparison of 2020 to 2019 Net RevenueNet revenue increased $422.6 million, or 11%, to $4.4 billion in 2020 from $4.0 billion in 2019. On a constant dollar basis, assuming the average exchange rates in 2020 remained constant with the average exchange rates in 2019, net revenue increased $412.7 million, or 10%.The increase in net revenue was primarily due to an increase in direct to consumer net revenue, partially due to a shift in the way guests are shopping due to COVID-19, as well as net revenue from MIRROR. This was partially offset by a decrease in company-operated store net revenue, as well as a decrease in net revenue from our other retail locations driven by temporary closures as a result of COVID-19 as well as reduced operating hours and restricted guest occupancy levels.Net revenue for 2020 and 2019 is summarized below.2020201920202019Year over year change (In thousands)(Percentage of revenue)(In thousands)(Percentage)Company-operated stores$1,658,807 $2,501,067 37.7 %62.9 %$(842,260)(33.7)%Direct to consumer2,284,068 1,137,822 51.9 28.6 1,146,246 100.7 Other459,004 340,407 10.4 8.6 118,597 34.8 Net revenue$4,401,879 $3,979,296 100.0 %100.0 %$422,583 10.6 %Company-Operated Stores. The decrease in net revenue from our company-operated stores segment was primarily due to the impact of COVID-19. All of our stores in North America, Europe, and certain countries in Asia Pacific were temporarily closed for a significant portion of the first two quarters of 2020. Certain stores experienced temporary re-closures during the last two quarters of 2020. COVID-19 restrictions, including reduced operating hours and occupancy limits, reduced net revenue from company-operated stores that have reopened. During 2020, we opened 30 net new company-operated stores, including 18 stores in Asia Pacific, nine stores in North America, and three stores in Europe.Direct to Consumer. Direct to consumer net revenue increased 101%, and increased 101% on a constant dollar basis. The increase in net revenue from our direct to consumer segment was primarily the result of increased traffic, and improved conversion rates, partially offset by a decrease in dollar value per transaction. The increase in traffic was partially due to COVID-19, with more guests shopping online instead of in-stores. During the second quarter of 2020, we held an online warehouse sale in the United States and Canada which generated net revenue of $43.3 million. We did not hold any warehouse sales during 2019. Other. The increase in net revenue from our other operations was primarily the result of net revenue from MIRROR as well as an increased number of temporary locations, including seasonal stores, that were open during 2020 compared to 2019. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in outlet sales primarily due to the impact of COVID-19. Gross Profit20202019Year over year change(In thousands)(In thousands)(Percentage)Gross profit$2,463,991 $2,223,386 $240,605 10.8 %Gross margin56.0 %55.9 %10 basis points26Table of ContentsThe increase in gross margin was primarily the result of:•a decrease in occupancy and depreciation costs as a percentage of net revenue of 60 basis points, driven primarily by the increase in net revenue; •a decrease in costs related to our product departments as a percentage of revenue of 50 basis points, driven by lower incentive compensation and travel costs, as well as the increase in net revenue; and•a favorable impact of foreign exchange rates of 10 basis points.The increase in gross margin was partially offset by an increase in costs as a percentage of net revenue related to our distribution centers of 80 basis points. This was primarily due to an increase in costs related to COVID-19 safety precautions, higher people costs related to the growth in our direct to consumer business, and increased usage of third-party warehouse and logistics providers. There was also a decrease in product margin of 30 basis points, which was primarily due to higher markdowns and air freight costs, partially offset by a favorable mix of higher margin product.Selling, General and Administrative Expenses20202019Year over year change(In thousands)(In thousands)(Percentage)Selling, general and administrative expenses$1,609,003 $1,334,247 $274,756 20.6 %The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to:•an increase in costs related to our operating channels of $253.2 million, comprised of:–an increase in variable costs of $144.1 million primarily due to an increase in distribution costs related to the growth in our direct to consumer net revenue, and an increase in credit card fees as a result of increased net revenue; –an increase in brand and community costs of $116.4 million primarily due to an increase in digital marketing expenses;–an increase in other costs of $14.2 million primarily due to increases in information technology costs; and–a decrease in employee costs of $21.5 million primarily due to lower incentive compensation expenses in our company-operated stores and other channels. This was partially offset by an increase in salaries and wages as a result of increased headcount and labor hours in our direct to consumer and other operations;•an increase in head office costs of $56.5 million, comprised of:–an increase of $63.0 million primarily due to increases in information technology costs, professional fees, depreciation, community giving, and other head office costs; and–a decrease in employee costs of $6.5 million primarily due to lower incentive compensation and travel expenses, partially offset by increased salaries and wages expense as a result of headcount growth, and higher stock-based compensation expense; and•an increase in net foreign exchange and derivative revaluation losses of $1.6 million.The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was partially offset by $36.5 million of government payroll subsidies. These payroll subsidies partially offset the wages paid to employees while our retail locations were temporarily closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.Amortization of Intangible Assets20202019Year over year change(In thousands)(In thousands)(Percentage)Amortization of intangible assets$5,160 $29 $5,131 n/aThe increase in the amortization of intangible assets was the result of the intangible assets recognized upon the acquisition of MIRROR during the second quarter of 2020. 27Table of ContentsAcquisition-Related Expenses20202019Year over year change(In thousands)(In thousands)(Percentage)Acquisition-related expenses$29,842 $— $29,842 n/aAs a result of our acquisition of MIRROR in the second quarter of 2020, we recognized acquisition-related compensation of $20.1 million for deferred consideration for certain continuing MIRROR employees. We also recognized transaction and integration related costs of $10.5 million for advisory and professional services, and integration costs subsequent to the acquisition. Acquisition-related expenses were partially offset by a $0.8 million gain recognized on our existing investment. We did not have acquisition-related expenses in 2019. Please refer to Note 6. Acquisition included in Item 8 of Part II of this report for further information.Income from OperationsOn a segment basis, we determine income from operations without taking into account our general corporate expenses. During the first quarter of 2020, we reviewed our segment and general corporate expenses and determined certain costs that are more appropriately classified in different categories. Accordingly, comparative figures have been reclassified to conform to the financial presentation adopted for the current year.Segmented income from operations before general corporate expenses is summarized below. Income from operations2020201920202019Year over year change(In thousands)(Percentage of net revenue of respective operating segment)(In thousands)(Percentage)Segment income from operations:Company-operated stores$212,592 $689,339 12.8 %27.6 %$(476,747)(69.2)%Direct to consumer1,029,102 484,146 45.1 42.6 544,956 112.6 %Other10,502 72,013 2.3 21.2 (61,511)(85.4)%$1,252,196 $1,245,498 $6,698 0.5 %General corporate expenses397,208 356,359 40,849 11.5 %Amortization of intangibles5,160 29 5,131 n/aAcquisition-related expenses29,842 — 29,842 n/aIncome from operations$819,986 $889,110 $(69,124)(7.8)%Operating margin18.6 %22.3 %(370) basis pointsCompany-Operated Stores. The decrease in income from operations from company-operated stores was primarily the result of decreased gross profit of $591.8 million which was primarily due to lower net revenue as well as lower gross margin. The decrease in gross margin was primarily due to deleverage on occupancy and depreciation costs as a result of lower net revenue. The decrease in gross profit was partially offset by a decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses, primarily due to lower people costs and lower operating costs. People costs decreased primarily due to lower incentive compensation. Store operating costs decreased primarily due to lower credit card fees, packaging and supplies, and distribution costs as a result of lower net revenue, as well as lower community, security, and repairs and maintenance costs. The recognition of certain government payroll subsidies also reduced selling, general, and administrative expenses. Income from operations as a percentage of company-operated stores net revenue decreased primarily due to lower gross margin and deleverage on selling, general and administrative expenses.Direct to Consumer. The increase in income from operations from our direct to consumer segment was primarily the result of increased gross profit of $773.7 million which was primarily due to increased net revenue and due to higher gross margin. The increase in gross profit was partially offset by an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses primarily due to higher variable costs including distribution costs, credit card fees, and packaging and supplies costs as a result of higher net revenue, as well as higher digital marketing expenses, employee costs and information technology costs. Income from operations as a percentage of direct to consumer net revenue has increased primarily due to leverage on selling, general and administrative expenses and an increase in gross margin.Other. The decrease in income from operations was primarily the result of increased selling, general and administrative expenses, driven primarily by MIRROR digital marketing expenses, as well as increased distribution costs and credit card fees 28Table of Contentsas a result of revenue generated by MIRROR. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was partially offset by an increase in gross profit related to MIRROR, driven by increased net revenue. Income from operations as a percentage of other net revenue decreased primarily due to deleverage on selling, general and administrative expenses.General Corporate Expenses. The increase in general corporate expenses was primarily the result of increases in information technology costs, salaries and wages as a result of headcount growth, professional fees, depreciation, community giving, and an increase in net foreign exchange and derivative losses of $1.6 million. The increase in general corporate expense was partially offset by a decrease in travel and incentive compensation costs, as well as the recognition of certain government payroll subsidies. We expect general corporate expenses to continue to increase in future years as we grow our overall business and require increased efforts at our head office to support our operations.Other Income (Expense), Net20202019Year over year change(In thousands)(In thousands)(Percentage)Other income (expense), net$(636)$8,283 $(8,919)(107.7)%The decrease in other income, net was primarily due to a decrease in net interest income as a result of lower cash balances and lower interest rates during the majority of 2020 compared to 2019. We did not have any borrowings on our revolving credit facilities during 2020 or 2019.Income Tax Expense20202019Year over year change(In thousands)(In thousands)(Percentage)Income tax expense$230,437 $251,797 $(21,360)(8.4)%Effective tax rate28.1 %28.1 %— basis pointsOur effective tax rate for 2020 was consistent with 2019. This included an increase in the effective tax rate due to certain non-deductible expenses related to the MIRROR acquisition which increased the effective tax rate by 60 basis points. This was offset by adjustments upon filing of certain income tax returns and an increase in tax deductions related to stock-based compensation.Net Income20202019Year over year change(In thousands)(In thousands)(Percentage)Net income$588,913 $645,596 $(56,683)(8.8)%The decrease in net income in 2020 was primarily due to an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses of $274.8 million, the recognition of acquisition-related expenses of $29.8 million, an increase in amortization of intangible assets of $5.1 million, and a decrease in other income (expense), net of $8.9 million. This was partially offset by an increase in gross profit of $240.6 million, and a decrease in income tax expense of $21.4 million.Comparable Store Sales and Total Comparable SalesWe use comparable store sales to assess the performance of our existing stores as it allows us to monitor the performance of our business without the impact of recently opened or expanded stores. We use total comparable sales to evaluate the performance of our business from an omni-channel perspective. We therefore believe that investors would similarly find these metrics useful in assessing the performance of our business. However, as the temporary store closures from COVID-19 resulted in a significant number of stores being removed from our comparable store calculations during the first two quarters of 2020, we believe total comparable sales and comparable store sales on a full year basis are not currently representative of the underlying trends of our business. We do not believe these full year metrics are currently useful to investors in understanding performance, therefore we have not included these metrics in our discussion and analysis of results of operations. We did not provide comparable sales metrics that included the first two quarters during 2020, and expect to do the same for 2021.Comparable store sales reflect net revenue from company-operated stores that have been open, or open after being significantly expanded, for at least 12 full fiscal months. Net revenue from a store is included in comparable store sales 29Table of Contentsbeginning with the first fiscal month for which the store has a full fiscal month of sales in the prior year. Comparable store sales exclude sales from new stores that have not been open for at least 12 full fiscal months, from stores which have not been in their significantly expanded space for at least 12 full fiscal months, and from stores which have been temporarily relocated for renovations or temporarily closed. Comparable store sales also exclude sales from direct to consumer and our other operations, as well as sales from company-operated stores that have closed.Total comparable sales combines comparable store sales and direct to consumer sales. In fiscal years with 53 weeks, the 53rd week of net revenue is excluded from the calculation of comparable sales. In the year following a 53 week year, the prior year period is shifted by one week to compare similar calendar weeks. Opening new stores and expanding existing stores is an important part of our growth strategy. Accordingly, total comparable sales is just one way of assessing the success of our growth strategy insofar as comparable sales do not reflect the performance of stores opened, or significantly expanded, within the last 12 full fiscal months. The comparable sales measures we report may not be equivalent to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresConstant dollar changes in net revenue and direct to consumer net revenue are non-GAAP financial measures.A constant dollar basis assumes the average foreign exchange rates for the period remained constant with the average foreign exchange rates for the same period of the prior year. We provide constant dollar changes in our results to help investors understand the underlying growth rate of net revenue excluding the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates.The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or with greater prominence to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures follows, which includes more detail on the GAAP financial measure that is most directly comparable to each non-GAAP financial measure, and the related reconciliations between these financial measures.The below changes in net revenue show the change compared to the corresponding period in the prior year.2020Net RevenueDirect to Consumer Net Revenue(In thousands)(Percentages)(Percentages)Change$422,583 11 %101 %Adjustments due to foreign exchange rate changes(9,898)(1)— Change in constant dollars$412,685 10 %101 %Liquidity and Capital ResourcesOur primary sources of liquidity are our current balances of cash and cash equivalents, cash flows from operations, and capacity under our committed revolving credit facility. Our primary cash needs are capital expenditures for opening new stores and remodeling or relocating existing stores, investing in information technology and making system enhancements, funding working capital requirements, and making other strategic capital investments both in North America and internationally. We may also use cash to repurchase shares of our common stock. Cash and cash equivalents in excess of our needs are held in interest bearing accounts with financial institutions, as well as in money market funds, treasury bills, and term deposits.We believe that our cash and cash equivalent balances, cash generated from operations, and borrowings available to us under our committed revolving credit facility will be adequate to meet our liquidity needs and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months. Our cash from operations may be negatively impacted by a decrease in demand for our products as well as the other factors described in ""Item 1A. Risk Factors"". In addition, we may make discretionary capital improvements with respect to our stores, distribution facilities, headquarters, or systems, or we may repurchase shares under an approved stock repurchase program, which we would expect to fund through the use of cash, issuance of debt or equity securities or other external financing sources to the extent we were unable to fund such capital expenditures out of our cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from operations.Capital expenditures are expected to range between $335.0 million and $345.0 million in fiscal 2021.30Table of ContentsAs of January 31, 2021, our working capital (excluding cash and cash equivalents) was $90.7 million, our cash and cash equivalents were $1.2 billion and our capacity under our committed revolving credit facility was $397.6 million.The following table summarizes our net cash flows provided by and used in operating, investing, and financing activities for the periods indicated: 20202019 (In thousands)Total cash provided by (used in):Operating activities$803,336 $669,316 Investing activities(695,532)(278,408)Financing activities(80,788)(177,173)Effect of exchange rate changes on cash29,996 (1,550)Increase in cash and cash equivalents$57,012 $212,185 Operating ActivitiesNet cash provided by operating activities increased $134.0 million to $803.3 million in 2020 from $669.3 million in 2019, primarily as a result of the following:•an increase from changes in operating assets and liabilities of $146.5 million, primarily due to the following:–$97.5 million related to accounts payable, partially due to a change in payment terms with our non-product vendors;–$76.8 million related to other accrued liabilities, primarily due to increases in accrued duty, freight, and other operating expenses as well as an increase in the sales return allowance as a result of COVID-19 reducing in-period returns;–$38.7 million related to inventories; and–$12.1 million related to other current and non-current liabilities.The increase from changes in operating assets and liabilities was partially offset by the following:–$38.4 million related to prepaid expenses and other current and non-current assets, including increases in cloud computing implementation costs; –$32.0 million related to accrued compensation and related expenses due to lower accrued incentive compensation, partially offset by acquisition-related compensation accruals; and–$8.2 million related to income taxes.•an increase of $44.2 million in adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities other than changes in operating assets and liabilities, primarily related to an increase in depreciation and amortization, deferred income taxes, the settlement of derivatives not designated in a hedging relationship, and stock-based compensation.The increase in cash provided by operating activities was partially offset by a decrease of $56.7 million in net income.Investing ActivitiesCash used in investing activities increased $417.1 million, to $695.5 million in 2020 from $278.4 million in 2019. The increase was primarily due to the acquisition of MIRROR, net of cash acquired for $452.6 million during 2020. This was partially offset by a decrease in capital expenditures. Capital expenditures for our company-operated stores segment were $134.2 million and $171.5 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively. The capital expenditures for our company-operated stores segment in each period were primarily for the remodeling or relocation of certain stores, for opening new company-operated stores, and ongoing store refurbishment. The decrease in capital expenditures for our company-operated stores segment was primarily due to fewer store renovations during 2020 in comparison with 2019. The capital expenditures for our company-operated stores segment also included $41.0 million to open 40 company-operated stores and $44.3 million to open 57 company-operated stores, in 2020 and 2019 31Table of Contentsrespectively. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic we delayed certain store renovations and new store openings. We expect to open between 40 and 50 company-operated stores in 2021.Capital expenditures for our direct to consumer segment were $37.2 million and $15.8 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively. We accelerated our investments in our e-commerce websites and mobile apps during 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and the impact it had on guest shopping behavior. The capital expenditures in 2020 were primarily related to enhancing the functionality and capacity of our websites, and in 2019 were primarily related to our then new distribution center in Toronto, Canada as well as other information technology infrastructure and system initiatives.Capital expenditures related to corporate activities and other were $57.8 million and $95.7 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively. The capital expenditures in each fiscal year were primarily related to investments in information technology and business systems, and for capital expenditures related to opening retail locations other than company-operated stores. The decrease in capital expenditures for our corporate activities and other was partially due to more larger scale projects in the prior year in comparison to the current year as well as a shift to cloud computing. Implementation costs related to cloud service arrangements are capitalized within other non-current assets in the consolidated balance sheets and the associated cash flows are included in operating activities. We anticipate that we will continue to shift towards more cloud-based technology services in the future.Financing ActivitiesCash used in financing activities decreased $96.4 million, to $80.8 million in 2020 from $177.2 million in 2019. The decrease was primarily the result of a decrease in our stock repurchases.During 2020, 0.4 million shares were repurchased at a cost of $63.7 million. During 2019, 1.1 million shares, were repurchased at a cost of $173.4 million. In the first quarter of 2019, we repurchased 1.0 million shares in a private transaction. We did not purchase any shares in private transactions during 2020. The other common stock was repurchased in the open market at prevailing market prices, including under plans complying with the provisions of Rule 10b5-1 and Rule 10b-18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, with the timing and actual number of shares repurchased depending upon market conditions, eligibility to trade, and other factors.Revolving Credit FacilitiesNorth America revolving credit facilityDuring 2016, we obtained a $150.0 million committed and unsecured five-year revolving credit facility with major financial institutions. On June 6, 2018, we amended the credit agreement to provide for (i) an increase in the aggregate commitments under the revolving credit facility to $400.0 million, with an increase of the sub-limits for the issuance of letters of credit and extensions of swing line loans to $50.0 million for each, (ii) an increase in the option, subject to certain conditions, to request increases in commitments from $400.0 million to $600.0 million and (iii) an extension in the maturity of the facility from December 15, 2021 to June 6, 2023. Borrowings under the facility may be made in U.S. Dollars, Euros, Canadian Dollars, and in other currencies, subject to the lenders' approval.As of January 31, 2021, aside from letters of credit of $2.4 million, we had no other borrowings outstanding under this credit facility.Borrowings under the facility bear interest at a rate equal to, at our option, either (a) based on the rates applicable for deposits on the interbank market for U.S. Dollars or the applicable currency in which the borrowings are made (""LIBOR"") or (b) an alternate base rate, plus, an applicable margin determined by reference to a pricing grid, based on the ratio of indebtedness to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortization, and rent (""EBITDAR"") and ranges between 1.00%-1.50% for LIBOR loans and 0.00%-0.50% for alternate base rate loans. Additionally, a commitment fee of between 0.10%-0.20% is payable on the average unused amounts under the revolving credit facility, and fees of 1.00%-1.50% are payable on unused letters of credit.The credit agreement contains negative covenants that, among other things and subject to certain exceptions, limit the ability of our subsidiaries to incur indebtedness, incur liens, undergo fundamental changes, make dispositions of all or substantially all of their assets, alter their businesses and enter into agreements limiting subsidiary dividends and distributions. We are also required to maintain a consolidated rent-adjusted leverage ratio of not greater than 3.5:1 and to maintain the ratio of consolidated EBITDAR to consolidated interest charges (plus rent) below 2:1. The credit agreement also contains certain customary representations, warranties, affirmative covenants, and events of default (including, among others, an event of default upon the occurrence of a change of control). As of January 31, 2021, we were in compliance with the covenants of the credit facility.32Table of ContentsMainland China revolving credit facilityIn December 2019, we entered into an uncommitted and unsecured 130.0 million Chinese Yuan revolving credit facility with terms that are reviewed on an annual basis. The credit facility was increased to 230.0 million Chinese Yuan during 2020. It comprises of a revolving loan of up to 200.0 million Chinese Yuan and a financial guarantee facility of up to 30.0 million Chinese Yuan, or its equivalent in another currency. Loans are available for a period not to exceed 12 months, at an interest rate equal to the loan prime rate plus a spread of 0.5175%. We are required to follow certain covenants. As of January 31, 2021, we were in compliance with the covenant and there were no borrowings or guarantees outstanding under this credit facility.364-Day revolving credit facilityIn June 2020, we obtained a 364-day $300.0 million committed and unsecured revolving credit facility. In December 2020, we elected to terminate this credit facility.Contractual Obligations and CommitmentsLeases. We lease certain store and other retail locations, distribution centers, offices, and equipment under non-cancellable operating leases. Our leases generally have initial terms of between five and 15 years, and generally can be extended in five-year increments, if at all. The following table details our future minimum lease payments. Minimum lease commitments exclude variable lease expenses including contingent rent payments, common area maintenance, property taxes, and landlord's insurance. Purchase obligations. The amounts listed for purchase obligations in the table below represent agreements (including open purchase orders) to purchase products and for other expenditures in the ordinary course of business that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms. In some cases, values are subject to change, such as for product purchases throughout the production process. The reported amounts exclude liabilities included in our consolidated balance sheets as of January 31, 2021.One-time transition tax. As outlined in Note 17. Income Taxes included in Item 8 of Part II of this report, U.S. tax reform imposed a mandatory transition tax on accumulated foreign subsidiary earnings which have not previously been subject to U.S. income tax. The one-time transition tax is payable over eight years beginning in fiscal 2018. The table below outlines the expected payments due by fiscal year.Deferred consideration. The amounts listed for deferred consideration in the table below represent expected future cash payments for certain continuing MIRROR employees, subject to the continued employment of those individuals up to three years from the acquisition date as outlined in Note 6. Acquisition included in Item 8 of Part II of this report.The following table summarizes our contractual arrangements due by fiscal year as of January 31, 2021, and the timing and effect that such commitments are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods: Total20212022202320242025Thereafter (In thousands)Operating leases (minimum rent)$874,517 $189,907 $177,819 $151,668 $127,834 $71,670 $155,619 Purchase obligations567,864 522,467 4,696 4,696 15,654 2,348 18,003 One-time transition tax payable48,226 5,076 5,076 9,518 12,691 15,865 — Deferred consideration49,544 25,194 24,341 9 — — — Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsWe enter into standby letters of credit to secure certain of our obligations, including leases, taxes, and duties. As of January 31, 2021, letters of credit and letters of guarantee totaling $2.8 million had been issued, including $2.4 million under our committed revolving credit facility.We have not entered into any transactions, agreements or other contractual arrangements to which an entity unconsolidated with us is a party and under which we have (i) any obligation under a guarantee, (ii) any retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity that serves as credit, liquidity or market risk support to such entity, (iii) any obligation under derivative instruments that are indexed to our shares and classified as equity in our consolidated balance sheets, or (iv) any obligation arising out of a variable interest in any unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit support to us or engages in leasing, hedging or research and development services with us.33Table of ContentsCritical Accounting Policies and EstimatesThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions. Predicting future events is inherently an imprecise activity and, as such, requires the use of judgment. Actual results may vary from our estimates in amounts that may be material to the financial statements. An accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically, could materially impact our consolidated financial statements. Our critical accounting policies, estimates, and judgements are as follows, and see Note 2. Summary of Significant Account Policies included in Item 8 of Part II for additional information:Inventory provisionsInventory is valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value. We periodically review our inventories and make a provision for obsolescence and goods that have quality issues or that are damaged. We record a provision at an amount that is equal to the difference between the inventory cost and its net realizable value. As at January 31, 2021 the net carrying value of our inventories was $647.2 million, which included provisions for obsolete and damaged inventory of $30.0 million. The provision is determined based upon assumptions about product quality, damages, future demand, selling prices, and market conditions. If changes in market conditions result in reductions in the estimated net realizable value of our inventory below our previous estimate, we would increase our reserve in the period in which we made such a determination.Goodwill impairment assessmentGoodwill is tested annually for impairment on the first day of the fourth quarter each fiscal year, or more frequently if there are indicators of impairment. Goodwill is allocated to the reporting unit which is expected to receive the benefit from the synergies of the combination. The Company has allocated $362.5 million of goodwill to the MIRROR reporting unit. As at November 2, 2020, we performed a qualitative assessment and concluded that it was more likely than not that the fair value of the MIRROR reporting unit exceeded its carrying value, and therefore, no further impairment testing was required. In concluding that it was more likely than not that the fair value of the MIRROR reporting unit exceeded its fair value we considered if there had been any negative changes to the key valuation inputs; including future revenue growth rates, future gross and operating margin, discount rates, and terminal value assumptions since the date of acquisition. In future periods a full impairment test may be required depending on changes to market conditions, performance of the MIRROR reporting unit, or changes in the Company's strategy.Deferred taxes on undistributed net investment of foreign subsidiaries. We have not recognized U.S. state income taxes and foreign withholding taxes on the net investment in our subsidiaries which we have determined to be indefinitely reinvested. This determination is based on the cash flow projections and operational and fiscal objectives of each of our foreign subsidiaries. Such estimates are inherently imprecise since many assumptions utilized in the projections are subject to revision in the future. For the portion of our net investment in our Canadian subsidiaries that are not indefinitely reinvested, we have recorded a deferred tax liability for the taxes which would be due upon repatriation. For distributions made by our Canadian subsidiaries, the amount of tax payable is partially dependent on how the repatriation transactions are made. The deferred tax liability has been recorded on the basis that we would choose to make the repatriation transactions in the most tax efficient manner. Specifically, to the extent that the Canadian subsidiaries have sufficient paid-up-capital, any such distributions would be characterized for Canadian tax purposes as a return of capital, rather than as a dividend, and would not be subject to Canadian withholding tax.As of January 31, 2021, the paid-up-capital balance of the Canadian subsidiaries for tax purposes was $2.0 billion. The net investment in our Canadian subsidiaries was $1.8 billion, of which $0.8 billion was determined to be indefinitely reinvested. The Canadian subsidiaries have sufficient paid-up-capital such that we could choose to repatriate the portion of our net investment that is not indefinitely reinvested without paying Canadian withholding tax. Deferred income tax liabilities of $3.0 million have been recognized in relation to the portion of our net investment in our Canadian subsidiaries that is not indefinitely reinvested, principally representing the U.S. state income taxes which would 34Table of Contentsbe due upon repatriation. The unrecognized deferred tax liability on the indefinitely reinvested amount is approximately $2.4 million.In future periods, if the net investment in our Canadian subsidiaries exceeds their paid-up-capital balance, whether due to a change in the amount that is indefinitely reinvested or as a result of accumulation of profits by these subsidiaries, we will record additional deferred tax liabilities for Canadian withholding taxes and our effective tax rate will increase.ContingenciesWe are involved in legal proceedings regarding contractual and employment relationships and a variety of other matters. We record contingent liabilities, when a loss is assessed to be probable and its amount is reasonably estimable. If it is reasonably possible that a material loss could occur through ongoing litigation, we provide disclosure in the footnotes to our financial statements. Assessing probability of loss and estimating the amount of probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors, including in some cases judgments about the potential actions of third-party claimants and courts. Should we experience adverse court judgments or should negotiated outcomes differ to our expectations with respect to such ongoing litigation it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKForeign Currency Exchange Risk. The functional currency of our foreign subsidiaries is generally the applicable local currency. Our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars. Therefore, the net revenue, expenses, assets, and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries are translated from their functional currencies into U.S. dollars. Fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar affect the reported amounts of net revenue, expenses, assets, and liabilities. Foreign exchange differences which arise on translation of our foreign subsidiaries' balance sheets into U.S. dollars are recorded as a foreign currency translation adjustment in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss within stockholders' equity.We also have exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates associated with transactions which are undertaken by our subsidiaries in currencies other than their functional currency. Such transactions include intercompany transactions and inventory purchases denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the purchasing entity. As a result, we have been impacted by changes in exchange rates and may be impacted for the foreseeable future. The potential impact of currency fluctuation increases as our international expansion increases.As of January 31, 2021, we had certain forward currency contracts outstanding in order to hedge a portion of the foreign currency exposure that arises on translation of a Canadian subsidiary into U.S. dollars. We also had certain forward currency contracts outstanding in an effort to reduce our exposure to the foreign exchange revaluation gains and losses that are recognized by our Canadian and Chinese subsidiaries on U.S. dollar denominated monetary assets and liabilities. Please refer to Note 15. Derivative Financial Instruments included in Item 8 of Part II of this report for further information, including details of the notional amounts outstanding.In the future, in an effort to reduce foreign exchange risks, we may enter into further derivative financial instruments including hedging additional currency pairs. We do not, and do not intend to, engage in the practice of trading derivative securities for profit.We currently generate a significant portion of our net revenue and incur a significant portion of our expenses in Canada. We also hold a significant portion of our net assets in Canada. The reporting currency for our consolidated financial statements is the U.S. dollar. A weakening of the U.S. dollar against the Canadian dollar results in:•the following impacts to the consolidated statements of operations:–an increase in our net revenue upon translation of the sales made by our Canadian operations into U.S. dollars for the purposes of consolidation;–an increase in our selling, general and administrative expenses incurred by our Canadian operations upon translation into U.S. dollars for the purposes of consolidation;–foreign exchange revaluation losses by our Canadian subsidiaries on U.S. dollar denominated monetary assets and liabilities; and–derivative valuation gains on forward currency contracts not designated in a hedging relationship;•the following impacts to the consolidated balance sheets:35Table of Contents–an increase in the foreign currency translation adjustment which arises on the translation of our Canadian subsidiaries' balance sheets into U.S. dollars; and–a decrease in the foreign currency translation adjustment from derivative valuation losses on forward currency contracts, entered into as net investment hedges of a Canadian subsidiary.During 2020, the change in the relative value of the U.S. dollar against the Canadian dollar resulted in a $57.0 million reduction in accumulated other comprehensive loss within stockholders' equity. During 2019, the change in the relative value of the U.S. dollar against the Canadian dollar resulted in a $4.6 million increase in accumulated other comprehensive loss within stockholders' equity.A 10% appreciation in the relative value of the U.S. dollar against the Canadian dollar compared to the exchange rates in effect for 2020 would have resulted in lower income from operations of approximately $22.0 million in 2020. This assumes a consistent 10% appreciation in the U.S. dollar against the Canadian dollar throughout the fiscal year. The timing of changes in the relative value of the U.S. dollar combined with the seasonal nature of our business, can affect the magnitude of the impact that fluctuations in foreign exchange rates have on our income from operations.Interest Rate Risk. Our committed revolving credit facility provides us with available borrowings in an amount up to $400.0 million. Because our revolving credit facilities bear interest at a variable rate, we will be exposed to market risks relating to changes in interest rates, if we have a meaningful outstanding balance. As of January 31, 2021, aside from letters of credit of $2.4 million, there were no borrowings outstanding under these credit facilities. We currently do not engage in any interest rate hedging activity and currently have no intention to do so. However, in the future, if we have a meaningful outstanding balance under our revolving facility, in an effort to mitigate losses associated with these risks, we may at times enter into derivative financial instruments, although we have not historically done so. These may take the form of forward contracts, option contracts, or interest rate swaps. We do not, and do not intend to, engage in the practice of trading derivative securities for profit.Our cash and cash equivalent balances are held in the form of cash on hand, bank balances, short-term deposits and treasury bills with original maturities of three months or less, and in money market funds. We do not believe these balances are subject to material interest rate risk.Credit Risk. We have cash on deposit with various large, reputable financial institutions and have invested in U.S. and Canadian Treasury Bills, and in AAA-rated money market funds. The amount of cash and cash equivalents held with certain financial institutions exceeds government-insured limits. We are also exposed to credit-related losses in the event of nonperformance by the financial institutions that are counterparties to our forward currency contracts. The credit risk amount is our unrealized gains on our derivative instruments, based on foreign currency rates at the time of nonperformance. We have not experienced any losses related to these items, and we believe credit risk to be minimal. We seek to minimize our credit risk by entering into transactions with credit worthy and reputable financial institutions and by monitoring the credit standing of the financial institutions with whom we transact. We seek to limit the amount of exposure with any one counterparty.InflationInflationary factors such as increases in the cost of our product and overhead costs may adversely affect our operating results. Although we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations to date, a high rate of inflation in the future may have an adverse effect on our ability to maintain current levels of gross margin and selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenue if the selling prices of our products do not increase with these increased costs.36Table of Contents",2023-12-30 21:53:03.246838

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSManagement's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Components of management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations include:•Overview - The Power of Three•Financial Highlights •Results of Operations •Comparison of 2021 to 2020•Comparable Store Sales and Total Comparable Sales•Non-GAAP Financial Measures•Liquidity and Capital Resources•Liquidity Outlook•Contractual Obligations and Commitments•Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesOur fiscal year ends on the Sunday closest to January 31 of the following year, typically resulting in a 52-week year, but occasionally giving rise to an additional week, resulting in a 53-week year. Fiscal 2021 and 2020 were each 52-week years. This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements based on current expectations that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions, such as our plans, objectives, expectations, and intentions included in the ""Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements."" Our actual results and the timing of events may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those described in the ""Item 1A. Risk Factors"" section and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.We disclose material non-public information through one or more of the following channels: our investor relations website (http://investor.lululemon.com/), the social media channels identified on our investor relations website, press releases, SEC filings, public conference calls, and webcasts.Overview - The Power of ThreeIn 2021, we continued to execute against our Power of Three growth plan. We have achieved some of our key growth goals under this plan two years ahead of schedule. These include generating $6 billion in net revenue, doubling our men's net revenue relative to fiscal 2018, and doubling our e-commerce net revenue relative to fiscal 2018 (which we achieved in 2020). We have seen the trends that we believe have fueled our business over the last few years continue. These include the desire to live an active and healthy lifestyle, the desire to be part of a diverse and inclusive community, and the desire to achieve wellness, both physically and mentally.We achieved these goals while strategically managing a number of challenges related to the COVID-19 environment, including stores closures, capacity constraints, and challenges across our supply chain including certain supplier factory closures, port slowdowns, and reduced air freight capacity. Product InnovationOur lens for product development and innovation continues to be what we refer to as the Science of Feel. In 2021, we continued to bring technical innovations to our guests including expanding our Yoga offering with the launch of our Instill franchise, made from our SmoothCover fabric; we continued to build out our high support bra offerings with the launch of the Air Support bra, our most tested bra to date, which took five years to research and develop and is made from our Ultralu fabric; and for men we launched the versatile License to Train short, made from our High Impact Swift Pique fabric and further built out our On The Move offering with the Bowline bottom. We are also particularly proud of our multi-year collaboration with the Canadian Olympic Committee and Paralympic Committee. This collaboration allows us to showcase the lululemon brand and our technical expertise within apparel on the world stage; and we believe it is a compelling platform that we can leverage to continue to grow our brand presence both inside and outside of Canada.Omni Guest ExperienceWe continue to see benefits from our omni business model and in 2021, net revenue in our company-operated store channel increased 70% and our e-commerce business increased 22%. We engaged with our guests both in real life (where and when it was safe to do so) and virtually. In our digital business, we continued to see the benefits of the investments we have made over the last several years, while we continue to invest in our websites and mobile apps as we work to elevate the guest 25Table of Contentsexperience. In 2021, we continued to make foundational investments which included expanding our accepted payment methods, improving our storytelling, making search more predictive, and making the checkout process more seamless. When looking at MIRROR, we continue to focus on strategies and initiatives which we believe will allow us to build our community and increase guest loyalty. These include setting up MIRROR shop-in-shops in approximately 200 stores in North America, including launching in Canada, and continuing to enhance the offering with new classes and connected accessories.Market ExpansionWe continued to expand our presence both in North America and in our international markets. During 2021, we opened 53 net new company-operated stores, including 31 stores in the PRC, seven stores in the rest of Asia Pacific, 10 stores in North America, and five stores in Europe. In 2021, our net revenue in North America increased 40%. In our international markets, we saw revenue growth of 53%, which keeps us on track with our goal to quadruple the business from 2018 levels by 2023. COVID-19 UpdateCOVID-19 continues to impact the global economy and cause disruption and volatility. While most of our retail locations were open throughout 2021, certain locations were temporarily closed based on government and health authority guidance. We believe we will continue to experience differing levels of disruption and volatility, market by market. The pandemic has also impacted our product manufacturers and our distribution and logistics providers. There has been disruption in transportation and port congestion, an increase in freight costs, and we have increased our use of air freight. We expect this disruption and increased costs to continue throughout fiscal 2022.Financial HighlightsThe summary below compares 2021 to 2020:•Net revenue increased 42% to $6.3 billion. On a constant dollar basis, net revenue increased 40%.•Company-operated stores net revenue increased 70% to $2.8 billion.•Direct to consumer net revenue increased 22% to $2.8 billion, or increased 20% on a constant dollar basis.•Gross profit increased 46% to $3.6 billion.•Gross margin increased 170 basis points to 57.7%.•Acquisition-related expenses of $41.4 million were recognized in 2021 compared to $29.8 million in 2020.•Income from operations increased 63% to $1.3 billion. •Operating margin increased 270 basis points to 21.3%. •Income tax expense increased 56% to $358.5 million. Our effective tax rate for 2021 was 26.9% compared to 28.1% for 2020.•Diluted earnings per share were $7.49 for 2021 compared to $4.50 in 2020. This includes $40.0 million and $26.7 million of after-tax costs related to the MIRROR acquisition in 2021 and 2020, respectively, which reduced diluted earnings per share by $0.30 and $0.20 in 2021 and 2020, respectively.Refer to the non-GAAP reconciliation tables contained in the ""Non-GAAP Financial Measures"" section of this ""Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations"" for reconciliations between constant dollar changes in net revenue and direct to consumer net revenue, and the most directly comparable measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.26Table of ContentsResults of OperationsThe following table summarizes key components of our results of operations for the periods indicated: 2021202020212020 (In thousands)(Percentage of revenue)Net revenue$6,256,617 $4,401,879 100.0 %100.0 %Cost of goods sold2,648,052 1,937,888 42.3 44.0 Gross profit3,608,565 2,463,991 57.7 56.0 Selling, general and administrative expenses2,225,034 1,609,003 35.6 36.6 Amortization of intangible assets8,782 5,160 0.1 0.1 Acquisition-related expenses41,394 29,842 0.7 0.7 Income from operations1,333,355 819,986 21.3 18.6 Other income (expense), net514 (636)— — Income before income tax expense1,333,869 819,350 21.3 18.6 Income tax expense358,547 230,437 5.7 5.2 Net income$975,322 $588,913 15.6 %13.4 %Comparison of 2021 to 2020 Net RevenueNet revenue increased $1.9 billion, or 42%, to $6.3 billion in 2021 from $4.4 billion in 2020. On a constant dollar basis, assuming the average foreign currency exchange rates in 2021 remained constant with the average foreign currency exchange rates in 2020, net revenue increased $1.8 billion, or 40%.The increase in net revenue was primarily due to increased company-operated store net revenue, which was the result of more extensive temporary store closures and COVID-19 operating restrictions that were in place during 2020. Direct to consumer net revenue and other net revenue also increased.Net revenue for 2021 and 2020 is summarized below.2021202020212020Year over year change (In thousands)(Percentage of revenue)(In thousands)(Percentage)Company-operated stores$2,821,497 $1,658,807 45.1 %37.7 %$1,162,690 70.1 %Direct to consumer2,777,944 2,284,068 44.4 51.9 493,876 21.6 Other657,176 459,004 10.5 10.4 198,172 43.2 Net revenue$6,256,617 $4,401,879 100.0 %100.0 %$1,854,738 42.1 %Company-Operated Stores. The increase in net revenue from our company-operated stores segment was primarily due to most of our stores being open throughout 2021, while almost all were temporarily closed for a significant portion of the first two quarters of 2020, and open with reduced operating hours and occupancy restrictions for the last two quarters of 2020 as a result of COVID-19. During 2021, we opened 53 net new company-operated stores, including 38 stores in Asia Pacific, 10 stores in North America, and five stores in Europe.Direct to Consumer. Direct to consumer net revenue increased 22%, and increased 20% on a constant dollar basis. The increase in net revenue from our direct to consumer segment was primarily the result of increased traffic and higher dollar value per transaction, partially offset by a decrease in conversion rates. During the second quarter of 2020, we held an online warehouse sale in the United States and Canada which generated net revenue of $43.3 million. We did not hold any warehouse sales during 2021. Other. The increase in other net revenue was primarily due to most of our outlet and pop up locations being open throughout 2021, while almost all were temporarily closed for a significant portion of the first two quarters of 2020, and open with reduced operating hours and occupancy restrictions for the last two quarters of 2020 as a result of COVID-19. The increase in net revenue from our other retail locations was partially offset by a decrease in net revenue from MIRROR.27Table of ContentsGross Profit20212020Year over year change(In thousands)(In thousands)(Percentage)Gross profit$3,608,565 $2,463,991 $1,144,574 46.5 %Gross margin57.7 %56.0 %170 basis pointsThe increase in gross margin was primarily the result of:•a decrease in occupancy and depreciation costs as a percentage of net revenue of 130 basis points, driven primarily by the increase in net revenue; •a decrease in costs related to our distribution centers and product departments as a percentage of net revenue of 30 basis points, driven primarily by the increase in net revenue; and•a favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates of 30 basis points.The increase in gross margin was partially offset by a decrease in product margin of 20 basis points, primarily due to higher air freight costs as a result of global supply chain disruption, partially offset by lower markdowns.

We also recognized transaction and integration related costs of $3.0 million and $10.5 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively. Acquisition-related expenses in 2020 were partially offset by a $0.8 million gain that was recognized on our existing investment. Please refer to Note 6. Acquisition included in Item 8 of Part II of this report for information on the nature and recognition of acquisition-related compensation expense.Income from OperationsOn a segment basis, we determine income from operations without taking into account our general corporate expenses. Segmented income from operations before general corporate expenses is summarized below. 2021202020212020Year over year change(In thousands)(Percentage of net revenue of respective operating segment)(In thousands)(Percentage)Segmented income from operations:Company-operated stores$727,735 $212,592 25.8 %12.8 %$515,143 242.3 %Direct to consumer1,216,496 1,029,102 43.8 45.1 187,394 18.2 Other77,283 10,502 11.8 2.3 66,781 635.9 $2,021,514 $1,252,196 $769,318 61.4 %General corporate expenses637,983 397,208 240,775 60.6 Amortization of intangible assets8,782 5,160 3,622 70.2 Acquisition-related expenses41,394 29,842 11,552 38.7 Income from operations$1,333,355 $819,986 $513,369 62.6 %Operating margin21.3 %18.6 %270 basis pointsCompany-Operated Stores. The increase in income from operations from company-operated stores was primarily the result of increased gross profit of $712.8 million, driven by increased net revenue and higher gross margin. The increase in gross margin was primarily due to leverage on fixed costs. The increase in gross profit was partially offset by an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses, primarily due to higher employee and operating costs. Employee costs increased primarily due to the increased number of hours worked as a result of COVID-19 impacts in 2020, as well as increased wage rates in 2021, and performance and growth in our business. Store operating costs increased, primarily due to increases in credit card fees, packaging costs and distribution costs as a result of higher net revenue, and due to government payroll subsidies during 2020 that partially offset selling, general and administrative expenses. Income from operations as a percentage of company-operated stores net revenue increased, primarily due to higher gross margin and leverage on selling, general and administrative expenses.Direct to Consumer. The increase in income from operations from our direct to consumer segment was primarily the result of increased gross profit of $311.2 million, driven by increased net revenue, partially offset by lower gross margin. The 29Table of Contentsdecrease in gross margin was primarily due to increased air freight and distribution center costs relative to net revenue. The increase in gross profit was partially offset by an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses primarily due to higher variable costs including distribution costs and credit card fees as a result of higher net revenue, as well as higher digital marketing expenses, depreciation, employee costs and technology costs. Income from operations as a percentage of direct to consumer net revenue has decreased primarily due to a decrease in gross margin and deleverage on selling, general and administrative expenses.Other. The increase in income from operations was primarily the result of increased gross profit of $120.6 million, driven by increased net revenue and higher gross margin. The increase in gross margin was primarily due to higher product margin. The increase in gross profit was partially offset by an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses, driven by higher overall salaries and wages expense, incentive compensation, MIRROR marketing expenses and professional fees. Income from operations as a percentage of other net revenue increased primarily due to leverage on selling, general and administrative expenses and a higher gross margin.General Corporate Expenses. The increase in general corporate expenses was primarily the result of increases in employee costs primarily from the growth in our business, as well as increased professional fees, brand and community costs, technology costs, and supplies. An increase in net foreign exchange and derivative losses of $5.3 million also contributed to the increase in general corporate expense. We expect general corporate expenses to continue to increase in future years as we grow our overall business and require increased efforts at our head office to support our operations.Other Income (Expense), Net20212020Year over year change(In thousands)(In thousands)(Percentage)Other income (expense), net$514 $(636)$1,150 (180.8)%The increase in other income, net was primarily due to a decrease in expenses related to our credit facilities, including for the 364-day credit facility that was in place during 2020. This was partially offset by a decrease in interest income primarily due to lower interest rates. We did not have any borrowings on our revolving credit facilities during 2021 or 2020.Income Tax Expense20212020Year over year change(In thousands)(In thousands)(Percentage)Income tax expense$358,547 $230,437 $128,110 55.6 %Effective tax rate26.9 %28.1 %(120) basis pointsThe decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to a net increase in tax deductions related to stock-based compensation, and adjustments upon filing of certain income tax returns, partially offset by non-deductible expenses in international jurisdictions. Certain non-deductible expenses related to the MIRROR acquisition increased the effective tax rate by 70 basis points in 2021 compared to 60 basis points in 2020.Net Income20212020Year over year change(In thousands)(In thousands)(Percentage)Net income$975,322 $588,913 $386,409 65.6 %The increase in net income in 2021 was primarily due to an increase in gross profit of $1.1 billion, an increase in other income (expense), net of $1.2 million partially offset by an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses of $616.0 million, an increase in income tax expense of $128.1 million, an increase in acquisition-related expenses of $11.6 million, and an increase in amortization of intangible assets of $3.6 million.Comparable Store Sales and Total Comparable SalesWe use comparable store sales to assess the performance of our existing stores as it allows us to monitor the performance of our business without the impact of recently opened or expanded stores. We use total comparable sales to evaluate the performance of our business from an omni-channel perspective. We believe investors would similarly find these metrics useful in assessing the performance of our business. However, as the temporary store closures from COVID-19 30Table of Contentsresulted in a significant number of stores being removed from our comparable store calculations during the first two quarters of 2020, we believe total comparable sales and comparable store sales on a full year basis are not currently representative of the underlying trends of our business. We do not believe these full year metrics are currently useful to investors in understanding performance, therefore we have not included these metrics in our discussion and analysis of results of operations. We did not provide comparable sales metrics that included the first two quarters during 2020 or 2021.Comparable store sales reflect net revenue from company-operated stores that have been open, or open after being significantly expanded, for at least 12 full fiscal months. Net revenue from a store is included in comparable store sales beginning with the first fiscal month for which the store has a full fiscal month of sales in the prior year. Comparable store sales exclude sales from new stores that have not been open for at least 12 full fiscal months, from stores which have not been in their significantly expanded space for at least 12 full fiscal months, and from stores which have been temporarily relocated for renovations or temporarily closed. Comparable store sales also exclude sales from direct to consumer and our other operations, as well as sales from company-operated stores that have closed.Total comparable sales combines comparable store sales and direct to consumer net revenue. In fiscal years with 53 weeks, the 53rd week of net revenue is excluded from the calculation of comparable sales. In the year following a 53 week year, the prior year period is shifted by one week to compare similar calendar weeks. Opening new stores and expanding existing stores is an important part of our growth strategy. Accordingly, total comparable sales is just one way of assessing the success of our growth strategy insofar as comparable sales do not reflect the performance of stores opened, or significantly expanded, within the last 12 full fiscal months. The comparable sales measures we report may not be equivalent to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresConstant dollar changes in net revenue and direct to consumer net revenue are non-GAAP financial measures.A constant dollar basis assumes the average foreign currency exchange rates for the period remained constant with the average foreign currency exchange rates for the same period of the prior year. We provide constant dollar changes in our results to help investors understand the underlying growth rate of net revenue excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates.The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or with greater prominence to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures follows, which includes more detail on the GAAP financial measure that is most directly comparable to each non-GAAP financial measure, and the related reconciliations between these financial measures.The below changes in net revenue show the change compared to the corresponding period in the prior year.2021Net RevenueDirect to Consumer Net Revenue(In thousands)(Percentages)(Percentages)Change$1,854,738 42 %22 %Adjustments due to foreign currency exchange rate changes(95,494)(2)(2)Change in constant dollars$1,759,244 40 %20 %Liquidity and Capital ResourcesOur primary sources of liquidity are our current balances of cash and cash equivalents, cash flows from operations, and capacity under our committed revolving credit facility. Our primary cash needs are capital expenditures for opening new stores and remodeling or relocating existing stores, investing in technology and making system enhancements, funding working capital requirements, and making other strategic capital investments both in North America and internationally. We may also use cash to repurchase shares of our common stock. Cash and cash equivalents in excess of our needs are held in interest bearing accounts with financial institutions, as well as in money market funds and term deposits.31Table of ContentsThe following table summarizes our net cash flows provided by and used in operating, investing, and financing activities for the periods indicated: 20212020Year over year change (In thousands)Total cash provided by (used in):Operating activities$1,389,108 $803,336 $585,772 Investing activities(427,891)(695,532)267,641 Financing activities(844,987)(80,788)(764,199)Effect of foreign currency exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents(6,876)29,996 (36,872)Increase in cash and cash equivalents$109,354 $57,012 $52,342 Operating ActivitiesThe increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily as a result of:•increased net income of $386.4 million;•an increase in cash flows from changes in operating assets and liabilities of $176.7 million. This increase was driven by changes in income taxes, accrued compensation, and accounts payable, partially offset by cash flows related to inventories; and•changes in adjusting items of $22.7 million primarily related to an increase in depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, and higher cash inflows related to derivatives not designated in a hedging relationship, partially offset by changes in deferred income taxes.Investing ActivitiesThe decrease in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to the acquisition of MIRROR, net of cash acquired for $452.6 million during 2020. This was partially offset by an increase in capital expenditures. Capital expenditures for our company-operated stores segment were $189.6 million and $134.2 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively. The capital expenditures for our company-operated stores segment in each period were primarily for the remodeling or relocation of certain stores, for opening new company-operated stores, and ongoing store refurbishment. The capital expenditures for our company-operated stores segment also included $47.1 million to open 56 company-operated stores and $41.0 million to open 40 company-operated stores, in 2021 and 2020 respectively. We expect to open approximately 70 new company-operated stores in 2022.Capital expenditures for our direct to consumer segment were $81.7 million and $37.2 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively. The capital expenditures in 2021 were primarily related to our distribution centers as well as other technology infrastructure and system initiatives.Capital expenditures related to corporate activities and other were $123.2 million and $57.8 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively. The capital expenditures in each fiscal year were primarily related to investments in technology and business systems, and for capital expenditures related to opening retail locations other than company-operated stores. The increase in capital expenditures for our corporate activities and other was partially due to more larger scale projects, this was partially offset by a continued shift to cloud computing in 2021. Implementation costs related to cloud service arrangements are recognized within other non-current assets in the consolidated balance sheets and the associated cash flows are included in operating activities. Financing ActivitiesThe increase in cash used in financing activities was primarily the result of an increase in our stock repurchases. During 2021, 2.2 million shares were repurchased at a cost of $812.6 million. During 2020, 0.4 million shares were repurchased at a cost of $63.7 million. The other common stock was repurchased in the open market at prevailing market prices, including under plans complying with the provisions of Rule 10b5-1 and Rule 10b-18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, with the timing and actual number of shares repurchased depending upon market conditions, eligibility to trade, and other factors.Liquidity OutlookWe believe that our cash and cash equivalent balances, cash generated from operations, and borrowings available to us under our committed revolving credit facility will be adequate to meet our liquidity needs and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months. Our cash from operations may be negatively impacted by a decrease in demand 32Table of Contentsfor our products as well as the other factors described in ""Item 1A. Risk Factors"". In addition, we may make discretionary capital improvements with respect to our stores, distribution facilities, headquarters, or systems, or we may repurchase shares under an approved stock repurchase program, which we would expect to fund through the use of cash, issuance of debt or equity securities or other external financing sources to the extent we were unable to fund such expenditures out of our cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from operations.The following table includes certain measures of our liquidity:January 30, 2022(In thousands)Cash and cash equivalents$1,259,871 Working capital excluding cash and cash equivalents(1)(50,352)Capacity under committed revolving credit facility396,976 __________(1)Working capital is calculated as current assets of $2.6 billion less current liabilities of $1.4 billion.Capital expenditures are expected to range between $600.0 million and $625.0 million in fiscal 2022.Our current commitments with respect to inventory purchases are included within our purchase obligations outlined below. The timing and cost of our inventory purchases will vary depending on a variety of factors such as revenue growth, assortment and purchasing decisions, product costs including freight and duty, and the availability of production capacity and speed. Our inventory balance as at January 30, 2022 was $966.5 million, an increase of 49% from January 31, 2021. Increased air freight usage and cost has contributed to the increase in inventory. On a number of units basis, our inventory increased 33% compared to January 31, 2021. We expect that our inventory balance will continue to grow in fiscal 2022 and we expect the growth rate will exceed net revenue growth in fiscal 2022.Our existing North America credit facility provides for $400.0 million in commitments under an unsecured five-year revolving credit facility. The credit facility has a maturity date of December 14, 2026, subject to extension under certain circumstances. As of January 30, 2022, aside from letters of credit of $3.0 million, we had no other borrowings outstanding under this credit facility. Further information regarding our credit facilities and associated covenants is outlined in Note 11. Revolving Credit Facilities included in Item 8 of Part II of this report.Contractual Obligations and CommitmentsLeases. We lease certain store and other retail locations, distribution centers, offices, and equipment under non-cancellable operating leases. Our leases generally have initial terms of between five and 15 years, and generally can be extended in five-year increments, if at all. The following table details our future minimum lease payments. Minimum lease commitments exclude variable lease expenses including contingent rent payments, common area maintenance, property taxes, and landlord's insurance. Purchase obligations. The amounts listed for purchase obligations in the table below represent agreements (including open purchase orders) to purchase products and for other expenditures in the ordinary course of business that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms. In some cases, values are subject to change, such as for product purchases throughout the production process. The reported amounts exclude liabilities included in our consolidated balance sheets as of January 30, 2022.One-time transition tax payable. The U.S. tax reforms enacted in December 2017 imposed a mandatory transition tax on accumulated foreign subsidiary earnings which have not previously been subject to U.S. income tax. The one-time transition tax is payable over eight years beginning in fiscal 2018. The one-time transition tax payable is net of foreign tax credits, and the table below outlines the expected payments due by fiscal year.Deferred consideration. The amounts listed for deferred consideration in the table below represent expected future cash payments for certain continuing MIRROR employees, subject to the continued employment of those individuals up to three years from the acquisition date as outlined in Note 6. Acquisition included in Item 8 of Part II of this report.33Table of ContentsThe following table summarizes our contractual arrangements due by fiscal year as of January 30, 2022, and the timing and effect that such commitments are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods: Total20222023202420252026Thereafter (In thousands)Operating leases (minimum rent)$944,809 $210,956 $199,274 $177,606 $117,844 $72,586 $166,543 Purchase obligations993,480 945,092 10,199 17,829 4,698 — 15,662 One-time transition tax payable43,150 5,076 9,518 12,691 15,865 — — Deferred consideration24,306 24,298 8 — — — — As of January 30, 2022, our operating lease commitments for distribution center operating leases which have been signed, but not yet commenced, was $379.7 million, which is not reflected in the table above.We enter into standby letters of credit to secure certain of our obligations, including leases, taxes, and duties. As of January 30, 2022, letters of credit and letters of guarantee totaling $4.4 million had been issued, including $3.0 million under our committed revolving credit facility. Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions. Predicting future events is inherently an imprecise activity and, as such, requires the use of significant judgment. Actual results may vary from our estimates in amounts that may be material to the financial statements. An accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically, could materially impact our consolidated financial statements. Our critical accounting policies, estimates, and judgements are as follows, and see Note 2. Summary of Significant Account Policies included in Item 8 of Part II for additional information:Inventory provisionsInventory is valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value. We periodically review our inventories and make a provision for obsolescence and goods that have quality issues or that are damaged. We record a provision at an amount that is equal to the difference between the inventory cost and its net realizable value. As of January 30, 2022 the net carrying value of our inventories was $966.5 million, which included provisions for obsolete and damaged inventory of $35.7 million. The provision is determined based upon assumptions about product quality, damages, future demand, selling prices, and market conditions. If changes in market conditions result in reductions in the estimated net realizable value of our inventory below our previous estimate, we would increase our reserve in the period in which we made such a determination.Goodwill impairment assessmentGoodwill is tested annually for impairment on the first day of the fourth quarter, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that an impairment may have occurred.We have allocated $362.5 million of goodwill to the MIRROR reporting unit. As of November 1, 2021, we performed a quantitative impairment analysis of the MIRROR reporting unit and concluded that the fair value of the MIRROR reporting unit exceeded its carrying value, and no impairment has been recognized.We used a discounted cash flow model to estimate the fair value, supplemented by market analysis, which indicated the fair value of MIRROR was at least 18% higher than its carrying value. The key assumptions of the fair value of the MIRROR reporting unit are the revenue growth rates, operating profit margins, and the discount rate. Our ability to generate expected cashflows is dependent on several factors including, but not limited to, trends in the Connected Fitness industry and the desire to exercise at home, our ability to attract new subscribers to grow the community, and to maintain a loyal subscriber base. The fair value of MIRROR is also dependent on the ability of MIRROR to leverage fixed costs and therefore achieve long term profitability. Declining cashflow trends compared to forecast, or other internal or external indicators, could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist, and goodwill may be impaired.Deferred taxes on undistributed net investment of foreign subsidiaries. We have not recognized U.S. state income taxes and foreign withholding taxes on the net investment in our subsidiaries which we have determined to be indefinitely reinvested. This determination is based on the cash flow projections and 34Table of Contentsoperational and fiscal objectives of each of our foreign subsidiaries. Such estimates are inherently imprecise since many assumptions utilized in the projections are subject to revision in the future. For the portion of our net investment in our Canadian subsidiaries that are not indefinitely reinvested, we have recorded a deferred tax liability for the taxes which would be due upon repatriation. For distributions made by our Canadian subsidiaries, the amount of tax payable is partially dependent on how the repatriation transactions are made. The deferred tax liability has been recorded on the basis that we would choose to make the repatriation transactions in the most tax efficient manner. Specifically, to the extent that the Canadian subsidiaries have sufficient paid-up-capital, any such distributions would be structured as a return of capital, rather than as a dividend, and would not be subject to Canadian withholding tax.As of January 30, 2022, the paid-up-capital balance of the Canadian subsidiaries for tax purposes was $2.0 billion. The net investment in our Canadian subsidiaries was $2.5 billion, of which $1.1 billion was determined to be indefinitely reinvested. The Canadian subsidiaries have sufficient paid-up-capital such that we could choose to repatriate the portion of our net investment that is not indefinitely reinvested without paying Canadian withholding tax. Deferred income tax liabilities of $3.8 million have been recognized in relation to the portion of our net investment in our Canadian subsidiaries that is not indefinitely reinvested, representing the U.S. state income taxes which would be due upon repatriation. The unrecognized deferred tax liability on the indefinitely reinvested amount is approximately $3.2 million.In future periods, if the net investment in our Canadian subsidiaries exceeds their paid-up-capital balance, whether due to the accumulation of profits by these subsidiaries or due to a change in the amount that is indefinitely reinvested, we will record additional deferred tax liabilities for Canadian withholding taxes and our effective tax rate will increase. Absent any changes to paid-up-capital of our Canadian subsidiaries, or permanent re-investment amounts, we expect the effective tax rate to increase in fiscal 2022. ContingenciesWe are involved in legal proceedings regarding contractual and employment relationships and a variety of other matters. We record contingent liabilities when a loss is assessed to be probable and its amount is reasonably estimable. If it is reasonably possible that a material loss could occur through ongoing litigation, we provide disclosure in the footnotes to our financial statements. Assessing probability of loss and estimating the amount of probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors, including in some cases judgments about the potential actions of third-party claimants and courts. Should we experience adverse court judgments or should negotiated outcomes differ to our expectations with respect to such ongoing litigation it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKForeign Currency Exchange Risk. The functional currency of our international subsidiaries is generally the applicable local currency. Our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars. Therefore, the net revenue, expenses, assets, and liabilities of our international subsidiaries are translated from their functional currencies into U.S. dollars. Fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar affect the reported amounts of net revenue, expenses, assets, and liabilities. Foreign currency exchange differences which arise on translation of our international subsidiaries' balance sheets into U.S. dollars are recorded as other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss within stockholders' equity.We also have exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates associated with transactions which are undertaken by our subsidiaries in currencies other than their functional currency. Such transactions include intercompany transactions and inventory purchases denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the purchasing entity. As a result, we have been impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates and may be impacted for the foreseeable future. The potential impact of currency fluctuation increases as our international expansion increases.As of January 30, 2022, we had certain forward currency contracts outstanding in order to hedge a portion of the foreign currency exposure that arises on translation of a Canadian subsidiary into U.S. dollars. We also had certain forward currency contracts outstanding in an effort to reduce our exposure to the foreign currency exchange revaluation gains and losses that are recognized by our Canadian and Chinese subsidiaries on U.S. dollar denominated monetary assets and liabilities. Please refer to Note 15. Derivative Financial Instruments included in Item 8 of Part II of this report for further information, including details of the notional amounts outstanding.35Table of ContentsIn the future, in an effort to reduce foreign currency exchange risks, we may enter into further derivative financial instruments including hedging additional currency pairs. We do not, and do not intend to, engage in the practice of trading derivative securities for profit.We currently generate a significant portion of our net revenue and incur a significant portion of our expenses in Canada. We also hold a significant portion of our net assets in Canada. The reporting currency for our consolidated financial statements is the U.S. dollar. A weakening of the U.S. dollar against the Canadian dollar results in:•the following impacts to the consolidated statements of operations:–an increase in our net revenue upon translation of the sales made by our Canadian operations into U.S. dollars for the purposes of consolidation;–an increase in our selling, general and administrative expenses incurred by our Canadian operations upon translation into U.S. dollars for the purposes of consolidation;–foreign exchange revaluation losses by our Canadian subsidiaries on U.S. dollar denominated monetary assets and liabilities; and–derivative valuation gains on forward currency contracts not designated in a hedging relationship;•the following impacts to the consolidated balance sheets:–an increase in the foreign currency translation adjustment which arises on the translation of our Canadian subsidiaries' balance sheets into U.S. dollars; and–net investment hedge losses from derivative valuation losses on forward currency contracts, entered into as net investment hedges of a Canadian subsidiary.During 2021, the change in the relative value of the U.S. dollar against the Canadian dollar resulted in a $3.4 million increase in accumulated other comprehensive loss within stockholders' equity. During 2020, the change in the relative value of the U.S. dollar against the Canadian dollar resulted in a $57.0 million reduction in accumulated other comprehensive loss within stockholders' equity.A 10% appreciation in the relative value of the U.S. dollar against the Canadian dollar compared to the foreign currency exchange rates in effect for 2021 would have resulted in lower income from operations of approximately $16.2 million in 2021. This assumes a consistent 10% appreciation in the U.S. dollar against the Canadian dollar over the fiscal year. The timing of changes in the relative value of the U.S. dollar combined with the seasonal nature of our business, can affect the magnitude of the impact that fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have on our income from operations.Interest Rate Risk. Our committed revolving credit facility provides us with available borrowings in an amount up to $400.0 million. Because our revolving credit facilities bear interest at a variable rate, we will be exposed to market risks relating to changes in interest rates, if we have a meaningful outstanding balance. As of January 30, 2022, aside from letters of credit of $3.0 million, there were no borrowings outstanding under these credit facilities. We currently do not engage in any interest rate hedging activity and currently have no intention to do so. However, in the future, if we have a meaningful outstanding balance under our revolving facility, in an effort to mitigate losses associated with these risks, we may at times enter into derivative financial instruments, although we have not historically done so. These may take the form of forward contracts, option contracts, or interest rate swaps. We do not, and do not intend to, engage in the practice of trading derivative securities for profit.Our cash and cash equivalent balances are held in the form of cash on hand, bank balances, and short-term deposits with original maturities of three months or less, and in money market funds. We do not believe these balances are subject to material interest rate risk.Credit Risk. We have cash on deposit with various large, reputable financial institutions and have invested in AAA-rated money market funds. The amount of cash and cash equivalents held with certain financial institutions exceeds government-insured limits. We are also exposed to credit-related losses in the event of nonperformance by the financial institutions that are counterparties to our forward currency contracts. The credit risk amount is our unrealized gains on our derivative instruments, based on foreign currency rates at the time of nonperformance. We have not experienced any losses related to these items, and we believe credit risk to be minimal. We seek to minimize our credit risk by entering into transactions with credit worthy and reputable financial institutions and by monitoring the credit standing of the financial institutions with whom we transact. We seek to limit the amount of exposure with any one counterparty.36Table of ContentsInflationInflationary factors such as increases in the cost of our product and overhead costs may adversely affect our operating results. During 2021 our product margin was impacted by higher air freight costs compared to 2020 as a result of global supply chain disruption. Sustained air freight cost increases or other inflationary pressures in the future may have an adverse effect on our ability to maintain current levels of gross margin and selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenue if the selling prices of our products do not increase with these increased costs, or we cannot identify cost efficiencies.37Table of Contents",2023-12-30 21:53:01.231161

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSManagement's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Components of management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations include:•Overview•Financial Highlights and Market Conditions and Trends•Results of Operations •Comparison of 2022 to 2021•Comparable Store Sales and Total Comparable Sales•Non-GAAP Financial Measures•Liquidity and Capital Resources•Liquidity Outlook•Contractual Obligations and Commitments•Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesOur fiscal year ends on the Sunday closest to January 31 of the following year, typically resulting in a 52-week year, but occasionally giving rise to an additional week, resulting in a 53-week year. Fiscal 2022 and 2021 were each 52-week years. This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements based on current expectations that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions, such as our plans, objectives, expectations, and intentions included in the ""Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements."" Our actual results and the timing of events may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those described in the ""Item 1A. Risk Factors"" section and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.We disclose material non-public information through one or more of the following channels: our investor relations website (http://corporate.lululemon.com/investors), the social media channels identified on our investor relations website, press releases, SEC filings, public conference calls, and webcasts.Overview In 2019 we announced our Power of Three growth plan which established our goal to double our total net revenue by 2023 and outlined our plans to double men's revenue, double digital net revenue, and to quadruple international net revenue. We achieved our goal to double our total net revenue ahead of schedule, and in 2022 we launched our new 5-year growth plan, the Power of Three ×2. Our Power of Three ×2 plan leverages the success of our prior growth strategy, and is comprised of three key pillars – Product Innovation, Guest Experience, and Market Expansion. We continue to see opportunity to grow our men's, direct to consumer, and international net revenue, while continuing to grow our core businesses.2022 was the inaugural year of our new plan and we successfully executed against our goals by delivering 30% net revenue growth. Our strength was balanced across channel, region, and merchandise category; and was achieved in a challenging macroeconomic backdrop with ongoing supply chain disruptions. The underlying trends that have fueled our business continue to do so, and include a desire for guests to live an active and healthy lifestyle, the desire for apparel that offers versatility, the desire to be part of a diverse and inclusive community, and the desire to achieve wellness, both physically and mentally.Product InnovationWe continue to solve for the unmet needs of our guest by bringing new technical innovations into our merchandise assortment. In 2022, we expanded our core running category with the launch of Senseknit, a proprietary fabric technology offering zoned compression. We entered new activities with our capsule collections for golf, tennis, and hiking. And we launched footwear, enabling us to provide a head-to-toe solution to our guests. The footwear collection currently includes three technical styles – Blissfeel, Chargefeel, and Strongfeel – all designed specifically for women. In addition, we launched a dual gender slide for pre- and post-workouts. 24Table of ContentsGuest Experience and MembershipOur omni operating model allows us to efficiently and effectively serve our guests in the ways most convenient to them – either in store or online. We saw strength across both channels in 2022 as net revenue in our company-operated store channel increased 29% and our direct to consumer net revenue increased 33%.Community is at the core of our brand. In 2022, we continued to engage with guests via in-store events, 10K runs in Atlanta and Houston, ambassador-led activations, and our Summer Sweat Games in China Mainland, among other in-person events. In addition, we connect with our community of guests through our connected fitness content provided by lululemon Studio.In October 2022, we launched our new two-tier membership program. The Essential membership tier is free and provides access to select content, as well as certain benefits in-store and online. We rebranded MIRROR to become lululemon Studio, the premium paid tier of the program which offers members a connected fitness experience via in-home hardware. As part of our membership launch, we also enhanced the lululemon Studio offering to include access to exclusive content provided by outside studio partners, as well as a discount on lululemon product purchases.As concerns with the COVID-19 pandemic have subsided the connected fitness industry has experienced challenging market conditions, and as a result we have seen weakening demand for our in-home fitness hardware. Hardware unit sales did not meet our expectations during the peak holiday selling period and the reduction in customer acquisition costs was less than anticipated. As a result, in the fourth quarter, we reviewed our strategy and we plan to evolve lululemon Studio to focus on digital app-based services. Building on the two-tier membership program, we will be expanding the lululemon Studio premium tier by enabling guests to access digital fitness content via a new app, launching in summer 2023, for a lower monthly fee. We believe this strategy will enable more guests to experience our digital fitness content, while also building a larger community of guests with a deeper connection to lululemon. In 2022 we recognized post-tax charges totaling $442.7 million related to lululemon Studio, including the impairment of goodwill, intangible assets, and property and equipment, and provisions against hardware inventory. See the section ""Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates"", Goodwill Impairment Assessment below and Note 8. Impairment of Goodwill and Other Assets included in Item 8 of Part II of this report for further information.Market ExpansionWe continued to expand our presence both in North America and in our international markets. During 2022, we opened 81 net new company-operated stores, including 31 stores in the PRC, nine stores in the rest of Asia Pacific, 32 stores in North America, and nine stores in Europe, including our first locations in Spain. In 2022, our net revenue in North America increased 29%. In our international markets, despite certain COVID-19 closures in the PRC, we saw net revenue growth of 35%. Financial HighlightsThe summary below compares 2022 to 2021 and provides both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. The adjusted financial measures for 2022 exclude $442.7 million of post-tax impairment and other charges recognized in relation to our lululemon Studio business unit (formerly MIRROR) and the post-tax net gain on the sale of an administrative building of $8.5 million. The adjusted financial measures for 2021 exclude acquisition-related expenses, and their related tax effects.•Net revenue increased 30% to $8.1 billion. On a constant dollar basis, net revenue increased 32%.•Total comparable sales increased 25%, or 28% on a constant dollar basis.–Comparable store sales increased 16%, or 19% on a constant dollar basis.–Direct to consumer net revenue increased 33%, or 35% on a constant dollar basis. •Gross profit increased 24% to $4.5 billion.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for reconciliations between the above adjusted non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.Market Conditions and TrendsMacroeconomic conditions, the recent COVID-19 pandemic, and supply chain disruption impacted our business and operating costs in 2022 and 2021. Certain trends are expected to continue into 2023, with the impact varying by market.Macroeconomic ConditionsMacroeconomic conditions, including foreign currency fluctuations, inflationary pressures, and labor shortages have impacted our financial results. This includes higher air freight costs during the first half of 2022 and increased wage rates during 2022 compared to 2021. We have not increased the retail prices on the significant proportion of our products. Inflation, an anticipated economic downturn, and other macroeconomic factors could also impact consumer purchasing behaviors and sustained increases in costs may have an adverse effect on our operating margins.COVID-19 PandemicMost of our retail locations were open throughout 2022 and 2021, with certain locations temporarily closed due to COVID-19 resurgences, including certain closures during 2022 in the PRC.Supply chain disruptionIn 2021 and 2022 we experienced supply chain disruption, including delays in inbound delivery of our products as well as in manufacturing. This supply chain disruption caused us to use higher cost modes of transport, including increasing our use of air freight. The supply chain disruption we have experienced has contributed to the 50% increase in our inventory balance as of January 29, 2023 compared to January 30, 2022. We expect that while the growth rate in our inventories will exceed net revenue growth in the first half of 2023, the growth rate will be relatively in line with net revenue growth in the second half of 2023.The use of air freight reduced our gross margin during the first half of 2022, however, we began seeing an improvement in the supply chain issues and experienced lower inbound freight costs in the second half of 2022, and this resulted in an overall improvement to our gross margin from air freight costs for 2022 compared to 2021. We expect that we will similarly see improvements in our gross margin from air freight costs in the first half of 2023 compared to the prior year when there was the supply chain disruption. 26Table of ContentsResults of OperationsThe following table summarizes key components of our results of operations for the periods indicated: 2022202120222021 (In thousands)(Percentage of revenue)Net revenue$8,110,518 $6,256,617 100.0 %100.0 %Cost of goods sold3,618,178 2,648,052 44.6 42.3 Gross profit4,492,340 3,608,565 55.4 57.7 Selling, general and administrative expenses2,757,447 2,225,034 34.0 35.6 Amortization of intangible assets8,752 8,782 0.1 0.1 Impairment of goodwill and other assets407,913 — 5.0 — Acquisition-related expenses— 41,394 — 0.7 Gain on disposal of assets(10,180)— (0.1)— Income from operations1,328,408 1,333,355 16.4 21.3 Other income (expense), net4,163 514 0.1 — Income before income tax expense1,332,571 1,333,869 16.4 21.3 Income tax expense477,771 358,547 5.9 5.7 Net income$854,800 $975,322 10.5 %15.6 %Comparison of 2022 to 2021 Net RevenueNet revenue increased $1.9 billion, or 30%, to $8.1 billion in 2022 from $6.3 billion in 2021. On a constant dollar basis, assuming the average foreign currency exchange rates in 2022 remained constant with the average foreign currency exchange rates in 2021, net revenue increased $2.0 billion, or 32%.The increase in net revenue was primarily due to increased direct to consumer net revenue, as well as due to company-operated store net revenue, including from new company-operated stores and increased comparable store sales. Other net revenue also increased.Total comparable sales, which includes comparable store sales and direct to consumer, increased 25% in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021. Total comparable sales increased 28% on a constant dollar basis.Net revenue for 2022 and 2021 is summarized below.2022202120222021Year over year change (In thousands)(Percentage of revenue)(In thousands)(Percentage)Company-operated stores$3,648,127 $2,821,497 45.0 %45.1 %$826,630 29.3 %Direct to consumer3,699,791 2,777,944 45.6 44.4 921,847 33.2 Other762,600 657,176 9.4 10.5 105,424 16.0 Net revenue$8,110,518 $6,256,617 100.0 %100.0 %$1,853,901 29.6 %Company-Operated Stores. The increase in net revenue from our company-operated stores was driven by net revenue from company-operated stores that were opened or significantly expanded since 2021 which contributed $435.9 million to the increase. During 2022, we opened 81 net new company-operated stores, including 40 stores in Asia Pacific, 32 stores in North America, and nine stores in Europe. The increase in net revenue from our company-operated stores was also driven by increased comparable store sales. Comparable store sales increased 16%, or 19% on a constant dollar basis. The increase in comparable store sales was primarily a result of increased store traffic, partially offset by a decrease in conversion rates. Dollar value per transaction was consistent year over year.Direct to Consumer. Direct to consumer net revenue increased 33%, or 35% on a constant dollar basis. The increase in net revenue from our direct to consumer segment was primarily a result of increased traffic, partially offset by a decrease in conversion rates and a lower dollar value per transaction.27Table of ContentsOther. The increase in other net revenue was primarily due to increased outlet sales, sales to wholesale accounts, license and supply arrangement revenue, recommerce revenue, and revenue from our pop up locations. The increase in net revenue was partially offset by a decrease in net revenue from lululemon Studio.Gross Profit20222021Year over year change(In thousands)(In thousands)(Percentage)Gross profit$4,492,340 $3,608,565 $883,775 24.5 %Gross margin55.4 %57.7 %(230) basis pointsOur updated lululemon Studio strategy will focus on digital app based services and means we no longer expect to be able to sell all of the in-home hardware inventory above cost. We recognized a provision of $62.9 million against hardware inventory during the fourth quarter of 2022. This reduced 2022 gross margin by 80 basis points. Please refer to Note 8. Impairment of Goodwill and Other Assets included in Item 8 of Part II of this report. The remaining 150 basis point decrease in gross margin was primarily the result of:•a decrease in product margin of 100 basis points primarily due to higher markdowns, sales mix, and increased damages and shrink, partially offset by lower air freight costs; •an increase in costs related to our product departments and distribution centers as a percentage of net revenue of 60 basis points; and •an unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates of 40 basis points.The decrease in gross margin was partially offset by leverage on occupancy and depreciation costs of 50 basis points, driven primarily by the increase in net revenue.Selling, General and Administrative Expenses20222021Year over year change(In thousands)(In thousands)(Percentage)Selling, general and administrative expenses$2,757,447 $2,225,034 $532,413 23.9 %Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenue34.0 %35.6 %(160) basis pointsThe increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to:•an increase in head office costs of $283.7 million, comprised of:–an increase in costs of $142.2 million primarily due to increased depreciation of $43.5 million and increased technology costs, including cloud computing amortization, of $35.7 million, as well as increased brand and community costs and professional fees; and–an increase in employee costs of $141.5 million primarily due to an increase in salaries and wages expense of $76.5 million and incentive compensation of $34.8 million, as well as increased stock-based compensation expense and travel costs, primarily as a result of headcount growth and increased wage rates.•an increase in costs related to our operating channels of $249.5 million, comprised of:–an increase in variable costs of $127.6 million primarily due to an increase in distribution costs and credit card fees, primarily as a result of increased net revenue; –an increase in employee costs of $104.2 million primarily due to an increase in salaries and wages expense and incentive compensation in our company-operated store and direct to consumer channels, primarily due to growth in our business and increased wage rates;–an increase in other costs of $15.3 million primarily due to an increase in repairs and maintenance costs, depreciation, and technology costs, partially offset by a decrease in professional fees; and28Table of Contents–an increase in brand and community costs of $2.4 million primarily due to an increase in digital marketing expenses related to our direct to consumer channel, partially offset by a decrease in marketing expenses related to lululemon Studio.The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was partially offset by a decrease in net foreign exchange and derivative revaluation losses of $0.8 million.Amortization of Intangible Assets20222021Year over year change(In thousands)(In thousands)(Percentage)Amortization of intangible assets$8,752 $8,782 $(30)(0.3)%The amortization of intangible assets was primarily the result of the amortization of intangible assets recognized upon the acquisition of MIRROR.

Segmented income from operations is summarized below. 2022202120222021Year over year change(In thousands)(Percentage of net revenue of respective operating segment)(In thousands)(Percentage)Segmented income from operations:Company-operated stores$991,067 $727,735 27.2 %25.8 %$263,332 36.2 %Direct to consumer1,562,538 1,216,496 42.2 43.8 346,042 28.4 Other107,083 77,283 14.0 11.8 29,800 38.6 $2,660,688 $2,021,514 $639,174 31.6 %General corporate expenses862,867 637,983 224,884 35.2 lululemon Studio obsolescence provision62,928 — 62,928 n/aAmortization of intangible assets8,752 8,782 (30)(0.3)Impairment of goodwill and other assets407,913 — 407,913 n/aAcquisition-related expenses— 41,394 (41,394)(100.0)Gain on disposal of assets(10,180)— (10,180)n/aIncome from operations$1,328,408 $1,333,355 $(4,947)(0.4)%Operating margin16.4 %21.3 %(490) basis pointsCompany-Operated Stores. The increase in income from operations from company-operated stores was primarily the result of increased gross profit of $413.7 million, driven by increased net revenue. The increase in gross profit was partially offset by an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses, primarily due to higher salaries and wages expense and higher incentive compensation as a result of the growth in our business and increased wage rates. Store operating costs increased, primarily due to increases in credit card fees and distribution costs as a result of higher net revenue, as well as increased repairs and maintenance. Income from operations as a percentage of company-operated stores net revenue increased due to leverage on selling, general and administrative expenses.Direct to Consumer. The increase in income from operations from our direct to consumer segment was primarily the result of increased gross profit of $527.9 million, driven by increased net revenue, partially offset by lower gross margin. The decrease in gross margin was primarily due to higher markdowns, sales mix, deleverage on distribution center and product team costs, and unfavorable foreign exchange, partially offset by lower air freight costs. The increase in gross profit was partially offset by an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses primarily due to higher distribution costs and credit card fees as a result of higher net revenue, as well as higher digital marketing expenses, depreciation, employee costs, and technology costs. Income from operations as a percentage of direct to consumer net revenue decreased primarily due to a decrease in gross margin, partially offset by leverage on selling, general and administrative expenses.Other. The increase in income from operations was primarily the result of a reduction in lululemon Studio marketing expenses and increased operating profit from our other lululemon retail operations. Increased net revenue from outlets, sales to wholesale accounts, license and supply arrangements, recommerce, and pop up locations resulted in increased gross profit. This was partially offset by a decrease in net revenue from lululemon Studio. Selling, general, and administrative expenses decreased due to lower lululemon Studio marketing costs, partially offset by higher people costs as a result of growth in our other lululemon retail locations. Income from operations as a percentage of other net revenue increased primarily due to leverage on selling, general and administrative expenses, partially offset by lower gross margin.General Corporate Expenses. The increase in general corporate expenses was primarily due to increased employee costs, primarily from headcount growth and increased wage rates, as well as increased depreciation, technology costs including cloud computing amortization, brand and community costs, and professional fees. The increase in general corporate expenses was partially offset by a decrease in net foreign exchange and derivative losses of $0.8 million. We expect general corporate expenses to continue to increase in future years as we grow our overall business and require increased efforts at our head office to support our operations.30Table of ContentsOther Income (Expense), Net20222021Year over year change(In thousands)(In thousands)(Percentage)Other income (expense), net$4,163 $514 $3,649 709.9 %The increase in other income, net was primarily due to an increase in interest income from higher interest rates, partially offset by an increase in other expenses.Income Tax Expense20222021Year over year change(In thousands)(In thousands)(Percentage)Income tax expense$477,771 $358,547 $119,224 33.3 %Effective tax rate35.9 %26.9 %900 basis pointsThe increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to certain non-deductible expenses related to the impairment of goodwill and other assets recognized in relation to our lululemon Studio business unit (formerly MIRROR) partially offset by the gain on sale of an administrative building in 2022 which increased the effective tax rate by 780 basis points. Certain non-deductible expenses related to the MIRROR acquisition increased the effective tax rate by 70 basis points in 2021. The increase in the effective tax rate was also due to the accrual of U.S. state tax and Canadian withholding taxes on unremitted earnings which are not considered to be permanently reinvested, adjustments upon filing of certain income tax returns, and a decrease in deductions for stock-based compensation, partially offset by a decrease in non-deductible expenses in international jurisdictions. Excluding the impairment of goodwill and other assets recognized in relation to our lululemon Studio business unit and the gain on sale of an administrative building in 2022, and the MIRROR acquisition-related expenses in 2021, and their tax effects, our adjusted effective tax rates were 28.1% and 26.2% for 2022 and 2021, respectively.Net Income20222021Year over year change(In thousands)(In thousands)(Percentage)Net income$854,800 $975,322 $(120,522)(12.4)%The decrease in net income in 2022 was primarily due to an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses of $532.4 million, an impairment charge recognized in 2022 of $407.9 million, an increase in income tax expense of $119.2 million, partially offset by an increase in gross profit of $883.8 million, a decrease in acquisition-related expenses of $41.4 million, a gain on disposal of assets of $10.2 million, and an increase in other income (expense), net of $3.6 million. Excluding the impairment of goodwill and other assets in relation to our lululemon Studio business unit (formerly MIRROR) and the gain on sale of an administrative building in 2022, and the MIRROR acquisition-related expenses in 2021, and their tax effects, adjusted net income increased $273.7 million or 27.0%.Comparable Store Sales and Total Comparable SalesWe use comparable store sales to assess the performance of our existing stores as it allows us to monitor the performance of our business without the impact of recently opened or expanded stores. We use total comparable sales to evaluate the performance of our business from an omni-channel perspective. We believe investors would similarly find these metrics useful in assessing the performance of our business. Comparable store sales reflect net revenue from company-operated stores that have been open, or open after being significantly expanded, for at least 12 full fiscal months. Net revenue from a store is included in comparable store sales beginning with the first fiscal month for which the store has a full fiscal month of sales in the prior year. Comparable store sales exclude sales from new stores that have not been open for at least 12 full fiscal months, from stores which have not been in their significantly expanded space for at least 12 full fiscal months, and from stores which have been temporarily relocated for renovations or temporarily closed. Comparable store sales also exclude sales from direct to consumer and our other operations, as well as sales from company-operated stores that have closed.Total comparable sales combines comparable store sales and direct to consumer net revenue. 31Table of ContentsIn fiscal years with 53 weeks, the 53rd week of net revenue is excluded from the calculation of comparable sales. In the year following a 53 week year, the prior year period is shifted by one week to compare similar calendar weeks. Opening new stores and expanding existing stores is an important part of our growth strategy. Accordingly, total comparable sales is just one way of assessing the success of our growth strategy insofar as comparable sales do not reflect the performance of stores opened, or significantly expanded, within the last 12 full fiscal months. The comparable sales measures we report may not be equivalent to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresConstant dollar changes in net revenue, total comparable sales, comparable store sales, and direct to consumer net revenue are non-GAAP financial measures.A constant dollar basis assumes the average foreign currency exchange rates for the period remained constant with the average foreign currency exchange rates for the same period of the prior year. We provide constant dollar changes in our results to help investors understand the underlying growth rate of net revenue excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates.Adjusted gross profit, gross margin, income from operations, operating margin, income tax expense, effective tax rates, net income, and diluted earnings per share exclude the impairment of goodwill and other assets recognized in relation to our lululemon Studio business unit (formerly MIRROR), the gain on disposal of assets for the sale of an administrative office building, the MIRROR acquisition-related expenses, and the related income tax effects of these items. We believe these adjusted financial measures are useful to investors as they provide supplemental information that enable evaluation of the underlying trend in our operating performance, and enable a comparison to our historical financial information. Further, due to the finite and discrete nature of these items, we do not consider them to be normal operating expenses that are necessary to operate the business, or impairments or disposal gains that are expected to arise in the normal course of our operations. Management uses these adjusted financial measures and constant currency metrics internally when reviewing and assessing financial performance.The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or with greater prominence to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures follows, which includes more detail on the GAAP financial measure that is most directly comparable to each non-GAAP financial measure, and the related reconciliations between these financial measures.Constant Dollar Changes in Net RevenueThe below changes in net revenue show the change compared to the corresponding period in the prior year.2022Net RevenueDirect to Consumer Net Revenue(In thousands)(Percentages)(Percentages)Change$1,853,901 30 %33 %Adjustments due to foreign currency exchange rate changes147,728 2 2 Change in constant dollars$2,001,629 32 %35 %32Table of ContentsConstant Dollar Changes in Total Comparable Sales, Comparable Store Sales, and Direct to Consumer Net RevenueThe below changes in total comparable sales, comparable store sales, and direct to consumer net revenue show the change compared to the corresponding period in the prior year.2022Total Comparable Sales1,2Comparable Store Sales2Direct to Consumer Net RevenueChange25 %16 %33 %Adjustments due to foreign currency exchange rate changes3 %3 2 Change in constant dollars28 %19 %35 %__________(1)Total comparable sales includes comparable store sales and direct to consumer net revenue.(2)Comparable store sales reflects net revenue from company-operated stores that have been open for at least 12 full fiscal months, or open for at least 12 full fiscal months after being significantly expanded.33Table of ContentsAdjusted financial measuresThe following tables reconcile adjusted financial measures with the most directly comparable measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.

Our primary cash needs are capital expenditures for opening new stores and remodeling or relocating existing stores, investing in technology and making system enhancements, funding working capital requirements, and making other strategic capital investments both in North America and internationally. We may also use cash to repurchase shares of our common stock. Cash and cash equivalents in excess of our needs are held in interest bearing accounts with financial institutions, as well as in money market funds and term deposits.The following table summarizes our net cash flows provided by and used in operating, investing, and financing activities for the periods indicated: 20222021Year over year change (In thousands)Total cash provided by (used in):Operating activities$966,463 $1,389,108 $(422,645)Investing activities(569,937)(427,891)(142,046)Financing activities(467,487)(844,987)377,500 Effect of foreign currency exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents(34,043)(6,876)(27,167)Increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents$(105,004)$109,354 $(214,358)Operating ActivitiesThe decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily as a result of a decrease in cash flows from changes in operating assets and liabilities of $726.1 million. This decrease was primarily driven by changes in accounts payable, inventories, and income taxes. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities was also due to lower cash inflows related to derivatives not designated in a hedging relationship.The decrease in cash provided by operating activities was partially offset by an increase in depreciation and stock-based compensation expense.Investing ActivitiesThe increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to increased capital expenditures, partially offset by the settlement of net investment hedges and other investing activities. The increase in capital expenditures was primarily due to corporate expenditures and from our company-operated stores segment.Capital expenditures for our company-operated stores segment were $303.7 million and $189.6 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively. The capital expenditures for our company-operated stores segment in each period were primarily for opening new company-operated stores, for the remodeling or relocation of certain stores, ongoing store refurbishment, and increased investment in our new and existing distribution facilities. The capital expenditures for our company-operated stores segment also included $78.9 million to open 87 company-operated stores and $47.1 million to open 56 company-operated stores, in 2022 and 2021 respectively. We expect to open 45 to 50 new company-operated stores in 2023.Capital expenditures for our direct to consumer segment were $57.1 million and $81.7 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively. Capital expenditures in 2022 were primarily related to our distribution centers as well as other technology infrastructure and system initiatives.Capital expenditures related to corporate activities and other were $277.9 million and $123.2 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase in capital expenditures in each fiscal year was primarily due to investments in technology and business systems, and for increased capital expenditures on corporate office renovations. The proceeds of the sale of an administrative office building during the second quarter of 2022 are included in other investing activities.Financing ActivitiesThe decrease in cash used in financing activities was primarily the result of a decrease in our stock repurchases. During 2022, 1.4 million shares were repurchased at a total cost including commissions and excise taxes of $444.0 million. During 2021, 2.2 million shares were repurchased at a total cost including commissions of $812.6 million. The common stock was repurchased in the open market at prevailing market prices, including under plans complying with the provisions of Rule 10b5-1 and Rule 10b-18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, with the timing and actual number of shares repurchased depending upon market conditions, eligibility to trade, and other factors.35Table of ContentsLiquidity OutlookWe believe our cash and cash equivalent balances, cash generated from operations, and borrowings available to us under our committed revolving credit facility will be adequate to meet our liquidity needs and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months. Our cash from operations may be negatively impacted by a decrease in demand for our products as well as the other factors described in ""Item 1A. Risk Factors"". In addition, we may make discretionary capital improvements with respect to our stores, distribution facilities, headquarters, or systems, or we may repurchase shares under an approved stock repurchase program, which we would expect to fund through the use of cash, issuance of debt or equity securities or other external financing sources to the extent we were unable to fund such expenditures out of our cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from operations.The following table includes certain measures of our liquidity:January 29, 2023(In thousands)Cash and cash equivalents$1,154,867 Working capital excluding cash and cash equivalents(1)512,388 Capacity under committed revolving credit facility393,480 __________(1)Working capital is calculated as current assets of $3.2 billion less current liabilities of $1.5 billion.Capital expenditures are expected to range between $660.0 million and $680.0 million in 2023.Our current commitments with respect to inventory purchases are included within our purchase obligations outlined below. The timing and cost of our inventory purchases will vary depending on a variety of factors such as revenue growth, assortment and purchasing decisions, product costs including freight and duty, and the availability of production capacity and speed. Our inventory balance as of January 29, 2023 was $1.4 billion, an increase of 50% from January 30, 2022. Increased air freight usage and cost have contributed to the increase in inventory. On a number of units basis, our inventory increased 58% compared to January 30, 2022. We expect that while the growth rate in our inventories will exceed net revenue growth in the first half of 2023, the growth rate will be relatively in line with net revenue growth in the second half of 2023.Our existing North America credit facility provides for $400.0 million in commitments under an unsecured five-year revolving credit facility. The credit facility has a maturity date of December 14, 2026, subject to extension under certain circumstances. As of January 29, 2023, aside from letters of credit of $6.5 million, we had no other borrowings outstanding under this credit facility. Further information regarding our credit facilities and associated covenants is outlined in Note 12. Revolving Credit Facilities included in Item 8 of Part II of this report.Contractual Obligations and CommitmentsLeases. We lease certain store and other retail locations, distribution centers, offices, and equipment under non-cancellable operating leases. Our leases generally have initial terms of between two and 15 years, and generally can be extended in increments between two and five years, if at all. The following table details our future minimum lease payments. Minimum lease commitments exclude variable lease expenses including contingent rent payments, common area maintenance, property taxes, and landlord's insurance. Purchase obligations. The amounts listed for purchase obligations in the table below represent agreements (including open purchase orders) to purchase products and for other expenditures in the ordinary course of business that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms. In some cases, values are subject to change, such as for product purchases throughout the production process. The reported amounts exclude liabilities included in our consolidated balance sheets as of January 29, 2023.One-time transition tax payable. The U.S. tax reforms enacted in December 2017 imposed a mandatory transition tax on accumulated foreign subsidiary earnings which have not previously been subject to U.S. income tax. The one-time transition tax is payable over eight years beginning in fiscal 2018. The one-time transition tax payable is net of foreign tax credits, and the table below outlines the expected payments due by fiscal year.36Table of ContentsThe following table summarizes our contractual arrangements due by fiscal year as of January 29, 2023, and the timing and effect that such commitments are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods: Total20232024202520262027Thereafter (In thousands)Operating leases (minimum rent)$1,174,024 $238,343 $265,787 $197,934 $143,603 $117,639 $210,718 Purchase obligations884,382 841,341 15,843 3,430 5,184 2,930 15,654 One-time transition tax payable38,073 9,518 12,691 15,864 — — — As of January 29, 2023, our operating lease commitments for distribution center operating leases which have been committed to, but not yet commenced, was $632.0 million, which is not reflected in the table above.We enter into standby letters of credit to secure certain of our obligations, including leases, taxes, and duties. As of January 29, 2023, letters of credit and letters of guarantee totaling $8.6 million had been issued, including $6.5 million under our committed revolving credit facility. Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions. Predicting future events is inherently an imprecise activity and, as such, requires the use of significant judgment. Actual results may vary from our estimates in amounts that may be material to the financial statements. An accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically, could materially impact our consolidated financial statements. Our critical accounting policies, estimates, and judgements are as follows, and see Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies included in Item 8 of Part II for additional information:Goodwill impairment assessmentGoodwill is tested annually for impairment on the first day of the fourth quarter, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that an impairment may have occurred.We acquired Curiouser Products Inc., dba ""MIRROR"" in 2020, subsequently re-branded ""lululemon Studio,"" and $362.5 million of goodwill was allocated to the lululemon Studio reporting unit.We performed a quantitative impairment analysis on October 31, 2022 for the lululemon Studio reporting unit. The result of this annual test concluded that the fair value of the lululemon Studio reporting unit exceeded its carrying value. We used a discounted cash flow model to estimate the fair value, supplemented by market analysis, which indicated the fair value of lululemon Studio was approximately 4% higher than its carrying value. The key assumptions of the fair value of the lululemon Studio reporting unit as of October 31, 2022 were the revenue growth rates, operating profit margins, and the discount rate. The test indicated that failure to increase the growth rate of new subscribers in the near term, or failure to reduce customer acquisition costs, or other internal or external factors could cause a material impairment of goodwill.Sales of hardware units did not meet our fourth quarter expectations and the reduction in customer acquisition costs was less than anticipated, and therefore our short and long term forecasts for lululemon Studio were revised downwards with an adverse impact on future expected cash flows. As a result, we reviewed our strategy and we plan to evolve lululemon Studio to focus on digital app-based services.We determined the lower than forecasted subscriber growth, and the shift in strategy, were triggering events which indicated we should conduct an impairment test as of January 29, 2023. We used a discounted cash flow model to estimate the fair value of the lululemon Studio reporting unit based on our updated strategic plans, supplemented by market comparable analysis. This led to the recognition of an impairment of goodwill of $362.5 million. The key assumptions in estimating the fair value of the lululemon Studio reporting unit were the revenue growth rates, operating profit margins, and the discount rate. The fair value of the lululemon Studio reporting unit is a Level 3 fair value measurement.Finite-lived intangible asset impairment assessmentAs of January 29, 2023, the performance of lululemon Studio in the fourth quarter of 2022 and our change in strategy were also triggering events which indicated we should test the related intangible assets for impairment. The undiscounted cash flows of the asset group to which the intangible assets belong were less than their carrying value, and therefore we calculated the fair value of the asset group, which was also less than its carrying value. This resulted in an impairment of $40.6 37Table of Contentsmillion, relating to the MIRROR brand, which is associated with in-home hardware and to the customer relationship intangible assets that were recognized as part of the acquisition. The carrying value of individual long-lived assets was not reduced to lower than their fair value. The fair values of the brand and the customer relationships were based on a relief from royalty method and a discounted cash flow model respectively, and are Level 3 fair value measurements.The relief from royalty method is dependent on certain key estimates, including forecast hardware and hardware subscriber revenues, the royalty rate, and the discount rate. Inventory provisionsInventory is valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value. We periodically review our inventories and make a provision for obsolescence and goods that have quality issues or that are damaged. We record a provision at an amount that is equal to the difference between the inventory cost and its net realizable value. As of January 29, 2023 the net carrying value of our inventories was $1.4 billion, which included provisions for obsolete and damaged inventory of $123.2 million. The provision is determined based upon assumptions about product quality, damages, future demand, selling prices, and market conditions, and includes a provision of $62.9 million against lululemon Studio hardware inventory. Our change in strategy related to lululemon Studio means we no longer expect to be able to sell all of the hardware inventory above cost. The net realizable value of the lululemon Studio inventory was determined based on hardware sales forecasts and assumptions regarding liquidation value. If we do not achieve our sales forecasts, have to sell the hardware at prices lower than our forecasts, or are unable to liquidate excess inventory and the prices we anticipate, this could reduce the net realizable value of this inventory below our estimate and we would increase our provision in the period in which we made such a determination. Deferred taxes on undistributed net investment of foreign subsidiaries. We have not recognized U.S. state income taxes and foreign withholding taxes on the net investment in our subsidiaries which we have determined to be indefinitely reinvested. This determination is based on the cash flow projections and operational and fiscal objectives of each of our foreign subsidiaries. Such estimates are inherently imprecise since many assumptions utilized in the projections are subject to revision in the future. For the portion of our net investment in our Canadian subsidiaries that is not indefinitely reinvested, we have recorded a deferred tax liability for the taxes which would be due upon repatriation. For distributions made by our Canadian subsidiaries, the amount of tax payable is partially dependent on how the repatriation transactions are made. The deferred tax liability has been recorded on the basis that we would choose to make the repatriation transactions in the most tax efficient manner. Specifically, to the extent that the Canadian subsidiaries have sufficient paid-up-capital, any such distributions would be made as a return of capital, rather than as a dividend, and therefore would not be subject to Canadian withholding tax.As of January 29, 2023, the net investment in our Canadian subsidiaries was $2.4 billion, of which $1.3 billion was determined to be indefinitely reinvested. The paid-up-capital balance of the Canadian subsidiaries was $740.6 million.We have recognized a deferred tax liability of $20.2 million as of January 29, 2023 which represents the Canadian withholding taxes payable on the portion of our Canadian earnings that are not indefinitely reinvested and cannot be repatriated as a return of capital, and U.S. state income taxes payable upon repatriation of the amounts which are not indefinitely reinvested.In future periods, if the net investment in our Canadian subsidiaries continues to grow, whether due to the accumulation of profits by these subsidiaries or due to a change in the amount that is indefinitely reinvested, we will record additional deferred tax liabilities, including both Canadian withholding taxes for the amount in excess of the paid-up capital balance and U.S. state income taxes, and our effective tax rate will increase. Absent any changes to the permanently reinvested amounts, or the paid-up-capital of our Canadian subsidiaries, we expect the effective tax rate to increase in 2023, where we will accrue Canadian withholding taxes and U.S. state income taxes for profits generated in our Canadian subsidiaries.ContingenciesWe are involved in legal proceedings regarding contractual and employment relationships and a variety of other matters. We record contingent liabilities when a loss is assessed to be probable and its amount is reasonably estimable. If it is reasonably possible that a material loss could occur through ongoing litigation, we provide disclosure in the footnotes to our financial statements. Assessing probability of loss and estimating the amount of probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors, including in some cases judgments about the potential actions of third-party claimants and courts. Should we 38Table of Contentsexperience adverse court judgments or should negotiated outcomes differ to our expectations with respect to such ongoing litigation it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKForeign Currency Exchange Risk. The functional currency of our international subsidiaries is generally the applicable local currency. Our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars. Therefore, the net revenue, expenses, assets, and liabilities of our international subsidiaries are translated from their functional currencies into U.S. dollars. Fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar affect the reported amounts of net revenue, expenses, assets, and liabilities. Foreign currency exchange differences which arise on translation of our international subsidiaries' balance sheets into U.S. dollars are recorded as other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss within stockholders' equity.We also have exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates associated with transactions which are undertaken by our subsidiaries in currencies other than their functional currency. Such transactions include intercompany transactions and inventory purchases denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the purchasing entity. As a result, we have been impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates and may be impacted for the foreseeable future. The potential impact of currency fluctuation increases as our international expansion increases.As of January 29, 2023, we had certain forward currency contracts outstanding in order to hedge a portion of the foreign currency exposure that arises on translation of a Canadian subsidiary into U.S. dollars. We also had certain forward currency contracts outstanding in an effort to reduce our exposure to the foreign currency exchange revaluation gains and losses that are recognized by our Canadian and Chinese subsidiaries on U.S. dollar denominated monetary assets and liabilities. Please refer to Note 16. Derivative Financial Instruments included in Item 8 of Part II of this report for further information, including details of the notional amounts outstanding.In the future, in an effort to reduce foreign currency exchange risks, we may enter into further derivative financial instruments including hedging additional currency pairs. We do not, and do not intend to, engage in the practice of trading derivative securities for profit.We currently generate a significant portion of our net revenue and incur a significant portion of our expenses in Canada. We also hold a significant portion of our net assets in Canada. The reporting currency for our consolidated financial statements is the U.S. dollar. A strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Canadian dollar results in:•the following impacts to the consolidated statements of operations:–a decrease in our net revenue upon translation of the sales made by our Canadian operations into U.S. dollars for the purposes of consolidation;–a decrease in our selling, general and administrative expenses incurred by our Canadian operations upon translation into U.S. dollars for the purposes of consolidation;–foreign currency exchange revaluation gains by our Canadian subsidiaries on U.S. dollar denominated monetary assets and liabilities; and–derivative valuation losses on forward currency contracts not designated in a hedging relationship;•the following impacts to the consolidated balance sheets:–a decrease in the foreign currency translation adjustment which arises on the translation of our Canadian subsidiaries' balance sheets into U.S. dollars; and–net investment hedge losses from derivative valuation losses on forward currency contracts, entered into as net investment hedges of a Canadian subsidiary.During 2022, the change in the relative value of the U.S. dollar against the Canadian dollar resulted in a $54.5 million increase in accumulated other comprehensive loss within stockholders' equity. During 2021, the change in the relative value of the U.S. dollar against the Canadian dollar resulted in a $3.4 million increase in accumulated other comprehensive loss within stockholders' equity.A 10% appreciation in the relative value of the U.S. dollar against the Canadian dollar compared to the foreign currency exchange rates in effect for 2022 would have resulted in lower income from operations of approximately $30.9 million in 2022. This assumes a consistent 10% appreciation in the U.S. dollar against the Canadian dollar over the fiscal year. The timing 39Table of Contentsof changes in the relative value of the U.S. dollar combined with the seasonal nature of our business, can affect the magnitude of the impact that fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have on our income from operations.Interest Rate Risk. Our committed revolving credit facility provides us with available borrowings in an amount up to $400.0 million. Because our revolving credit facilities bear interest at a variable rate, we will be exposed to market risks relating to changes in interest rates, if we have a meaningful outstanding balance. As of January 29, 2023, aside from letters of credit of $6.5 million, there were no borrowings outstanding under these credit facilities. We currently do not engage in any interest rate hedging activity and currently have no intention to do so. However, in the future, if we have a meaningful outstanding balance under our revolving facility, in an effort to mitigate losses associated with these risks, we may at times enter into derivative financial instruments, although we have not historically done so. These may take the form of forward contracts, option contracts, or interest rate swaps. We do not, and do not intend to, engage in the practice of trading derivative securities for profit.Our cash and cash equivalent balances are held in the form of cash on hand, bank balances, and short-term deposits with original maturities of three months or less, and in money market funds. We do not believe these balances are subject to material interest rate risk.Credit Risk. We have cash on deposit with various large, reputable financial institutions and have invested in AAA-rated money market funds. The amount of cash and cash equivalents held with certain financial institutions exceeds government-insured limits. We are also exposed to credit-related losses in the event of nonperformance by the financial institutions that are counterparties to our forward currency contracts. The credit risk amount is our unrealized gains on our derivative instruments, based on foreign currency rates at the time of nonperformance. We have not experienced any losses related to these items, and we believe credit risk to be minimal. We seek to minimize our credit risk by entering into transactions with investment grade credit worthy and reputable financial institutions and by monitoring the credit standing of the financial institutions with whom we transact. We seek to limit the amount of exposure with any one counterparty.InflationInflationary factors such as increases in the cost of our product, as well as overhead costs and capital expenditures may adversely affect our operating results. During 2021 and the first half of 2022, our operating margin was impacted by higher air freight costs compared to fiscal 2021 and 2020 as a result of global supply chain disruption, as well as increased wage rates. Sustained increases in transportation costs, wages, and raw material costs, or other inflationary pressures in the future may have an adverse effect on our ability to maintain current levels of operating margin if the selling prices of our products do not increase with these increased costs, or we cannot identify cost efficiencies.40Table of Contents",2023-12-30 21:53:05.991707
