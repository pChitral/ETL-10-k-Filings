At December 31, 2012, we had total assets of $48 billion. Our common stock trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “PSX.”We have organized our operations into three operating segments:•Refining and Marketing (R&M). This segment purchases, refines, markets and transports crude oil and petroleum products, mainly in the United States, Europe and Asia. This segment also includes power generation activities, as well as specialties businesses such as flow improvers and lubricants.•Midstream. This segment gathers, processes, transports and markets natural gas; and transports, fractionates and markets natural gas liquids (NGL) in the United States. The Midstream segment includes our 50 percent equity investment in DCP Midstream, LLC (DCP Midstream).•Chemicals. This segment manufactures and markets petrochemicals and plastics on a worldwide basis. The Chemicals segment consists of our 50 percent equity investment in Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC (CPChem).The SeparationOn April 4, 2012, the ConocoPhillips Board of Directors approved the separation of its downstream businesses into an independent, publicly traded company named Phillips 66. In accordance with the Separation and Distribution Agreement, the two companies were separated by ConocoPhillips distributing to its stockholders all 625,272,302 shares of common stock of Phillips 66 after the market closed on April 30, 2012 (the Separation). Each ConocoPhillips shareholder received one share of Phillips 66 stock for every two shares of ConocoPhillips stock held at the close of business on the record date of April 16, 2012. In conjunction with the Separation, ConocoPhillips received a private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to the effect that, based on certain facts, assumptions, representations and undertakings set forth in the ruling, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the distribution of Phillips 66 stock was not taxable to ConocoPhillips or U.S. holders of ConocoPhillips common stock, except with respect to cash received in lieu of fractional share interests. Following the Separation, ConocoPhillips retained no ownership interest in Phillips 66, and each company now has separate public ownership, boards of directors and management. A registration statement on Form 10, as amended through the time of its effectiveness, describing the Separation was filed by Phillips 66 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and was declared effective on April 12, 2012 (the Form 10).27Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsBasis of PresentationPrior to the Separation on April 30, 2012, our results of operations, financial position and cash flows consisted of ConocoPhillips' refining, marketing and transportation operations; its natural gas gathering, processing, transmission and marketing operations, including its equity investment in DCP Midstream; its petrochemical operations, conducted through its equity investment in CPChem; its power generation operations; and an allocable portion of its corporate costs (together, the “downstream businesses”). These financial statements have been presented as if the downstream businesses had been combined for all periods presented. All intercompany transactions and accounts within the downstream businesses were eliminated. The assets and liabilities have been reflected on a historical cost basis, as all of the assets and liabilities presented were wholly owned by ConocoPhillips and were transferred within the ConocoPhillips consolidated group. The statement of income for periods prior to the Separation includes expense allocations for certain corporate functions historically performed by ConocoPhillips and not allocated to its operating segments, including allocations of general corporate expenses related to executive oversight, accounting, treasury, tax, legal, procurement and information technology. These allocations were based primarily on specific identification of time and/or activities associated with the downstream businesses, employee headcount or capital expenditures, and our management believes the assumptions underlying the allocations were reasonable. The combined financial statements may not necessarily reflect all of the actual expenses that would have been incurred had we been a stand-alone company during the periods presented prior to the Separation. All financial information presented after the Separation represents the consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows of Phillips 66.Executive OverviewWe reported earnings of $4.1 billion in 2012. Refining margins remained strong in 2012, particularly in the Midcontinent region. Chemicals margins also remained robust in 2012. We generated cash from operations in 2012 of $4.3 billion, which we used to fund capital expenditures and investments of $1.7 billion, pay dividends of $282 million, repurchase $356 million of our common shares, make a $1.0 billion pre-payment on our debt, and increase our cash and cash equivalents balance to $3.5 billion at December 31, 2012. We ended 2012 with approximately $5.0 billion of total capacity under our available liquidity facilities. Our solid financial results in 2012 allowed us to accelerate our strategy of creating value for shareholders:•We increased our quarterly dividend rate by 25 percent in the fourth quarter of 2012, to $0.25 per share. We also announced in the fourth quarter of 2012 that the annual dividend rate would be further increased by an additional 25 percent, effective in 2013.•We initiated a $1 billion share repurchase program in the third quarter of 2012 and, in the fourth quarter, we increased the program to $2 billion. Through December 31, 2012, we repurchased $356 million of our common shares.We continue to focus on the following strategic areas:•Operating safely, reliably and in an environmentally sound manner. Safety and reliability are our first priority, and we are committed to protecting the health and safety of everyone who has a role in our operations and the communities in which we operate. Optimizing utilization rates at our refineries through reliable and safe operations enables us to capture the value available in the market in terms of prices and margins. During 2012, our worldwide refining capacity utilization rate was 93 percent, compared with 92 percent in 2011. Additionally, we strive to conduct our operations in a manner consistent with our environmental stewardship principles.•Improving our advantaged crude runs in our refineries. U.S. crude production continued to increase and limited infrastructure for takeaway options resulted in lower feedstock costs for U.S. refiners with refineries that run advantaged crudes. Refineries capable of processing West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude and crude oils that price relative to WTI, primarily the Midcontinent and Gulf Coast refineries, benefited from these lower regional feedstock prices. We are already running advantaged crude in eight of our refineries in the United States. We are moving advantaged crude by truck, rail, barge and ocean-going vessel to our refineries. We have expanded our truck, rail rack and marine capability, and we are leasing 2,000 additional railcars to deliver advantaged crude to our refineries.•Controlling costs and expenses. Since we cannot control the prices of the commodity products we sell, controlling operating and overhead costs, within the context of our commitment to safety and environmental stewardship, are high priorities. Operating and overhead costs increased 5 percent in 2012, compared with 2011, primarily due to the Separation. However, we have established “Optimize 66,” a program that concentrates on not only cost reductions, but also on process improvements, to improve our overall effectiveness and eliminate the cost “dis-synergies” resulting from the Separation.28Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements•Funding growth and enhancing returns. Our capital program plan for 2013 is $3.7 billion, 3 percent higher than the 2012 program. This includes our portion of planned capital spending by DCP Midstream, CPChem and WRB Refining LP (WRB) totaling $1.8 billion, which is not expected to require cash outlays by us. The other $1.9 billion represents our consolidated investments in R&M, Midstream and Corporate and Other. This program is designed to grow our Midstream and Chemicals segments and to improve returns in our R&M segment. We intend to grow our Midstream segment both through our ownership in DCP Midstream and our own Phillips 66 midstream assets. We have invested directly in the Sand Hills and Southern Hills pipelines, and we have announced our plans to form a master limited partnership to grow additional midstream and transportation infrastructure in the future. We intend to grow our Chemicals segment through our ownership in CPChem. CPChem has large olefins and polyolefins projects underway in the U.S. Gulf Coast region. In the R&M segment, we plan to improve returns through increasing our advantaged crude runs in our refineries, while selectively investing in smaller, higher-return projects. Business EnvironmentResults for our R&M segment depend largely on refining and marketing margins, cost control, refinery throughput, and product yields. The crack spread is a measure of the difference between market prices for refined petroleum products and crude oil, and it is used within our industry as an indicator for refining margins. Both domestic and international industry average crack spreads increased from 2010 to 2011 and again from 2011 to 2012. The improvements were consistent with improved global demand for refined products resulting from worldwide economic recovery along with limited net increases in global refining capacity. U.S. margins in the Midcontinent were especially strong, which can be attributed to the region's crude feedstock advantage.In addition, U.S. crude production continued to increase, and limited infrastructure for takeaway options resulted in advantaged crude prices for U.S. refiners with access to advantaged crudes. Midcontinent refiners were especially advantaged. Increasing pressure on inventories in the Midcontinent continued to cause WTI crude to trade at a deep discount relative to crudes such as Light Louisiana Sweet (LLS) and Brent. Refineries capable of processing WTI crude and crude oils that price relative to WTI, primarily the Midcontinent and Gulf Coast refineries, benefited from these lower regional feedstock prices.The Midstream segment's results are closely linked to NGL prices relative to crude oil prices and, to a lesser extent, natural gas prices. NGL prices improved in both 2010 and 2011 along with crude oil prices, but decreased in 2012 while crude prices stayed relatively stable. The NGL price decrease in 2012 was primarily due to growing NGL production from liquids-rich shale plays, while a corresponding demand increase from the petrochemical industry has not yet materialized as projects remain under development.The Chemicals segment consists of our 50 percent equity investment in CPChem. The chemicals and plastics industry is mainly a commodity-based industry where the margins for key products are based on market factors. The chemicals and plastics industry experienced robust margin improvement from 2010 to 2011, and then again in 2012. Generally, ethylene margins improved in regions of the world where production is based upon NGL versus crude-derived feedstocks. In particular, North American ethane-based crackers benefited from the lower-priced feedstocks.29Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsRESULTS OF OPERATIONSConsolidated ResultsA summary of the company’s earnings by business segment follows: Millions of Dollars Year Ended December 31 2012 2011 2010 R&M$3,729 3,848 146Midstream6 403 262Chemicals823 716 486Corporate and Other(434) (192) (159)Net income attributable to Phillips 66$4,124 4,775 7352012 vs. 2011 Earnings for Phillips 66 decreased 14 percent in 2012, primarily resulting from:•A $1,437 million after-tax decrease in net gains on asset dispositions in 2012. 2011 results included significant gains on the disposition of three pipeline systems.•A $648 million after-tax increase in impairments in 2012, primarily reflecting 2012 impairments of our equity investments in Rockies Express Pipeline LLC (REX), a natural gas transmission system, and Malaysian Refining Company Sdn. Bdh. (MRC), a refining company in Melaka, Malaysia.•A $137 million after-tax increase in net interest expense, reflecting the issuance of $7.8 billion of debt during the first-half of 2012 in association with the Separation.•Lower NGL prices during 2012, which contributed to decreased earnings from our Midstream segment.These items were partially offset by:•Improved refining margins in the R&M segment.•Improved ethylene and polyethylene margins in the Chemicals segment.2011 vs. 2010 Earnings for Phillips 66 increased $4,040 million in 2011. The improved results in 2011 were primarily the result of: •Improved results from our R&M segment, reflecting significantly higher domestic refining margins.•Higher net gains from asset dispositions. 2011 net gains from asset dispositions were $1,546 million after tax, compared with 2010 gains of $118 million after tax.•Lower property impairments. 2010 earnings included a $1,174 million after-tax impairment of our formerly owned Wilhelmshaven Refinery (WRG) in Germany, which was partly offset by a $303 million after-tax impairment and warehouse inventory write-down associated with our Trainer Refinery in 2011.•Increased earnings in the Chemicals segment, primarily due to higher margins and volumes in the olefins and polyolefins business line.•Improved earnings from the Midstream segment, mainly due to higher NGL prices.30Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsIncome Statement Analysis2012 vs. 2011 Sales and other operating revenues decreased 8 percent in 2012, while purchased crude oil and products decreased 11 percent. The decreases were mainly due to processing lower refining volumes at our wholly owned refineries, resulting from the shutdown of Trainer Refinery in September 2011, combined with lower crude oil and NGL prices. Equity in earnings of affiliates increased 10 percent in 2012, primarily resulting from improved earnings from WRB and CPChem. Equity in earnings of WRB increased 43 percent, mainly due to higher refining margins in the Central Corridor, combined with processing higher volumes associated with the startup of the coker and refining expansion (CORE) project at the Wood River Refinery. Equity in earnings of CPChem increased 22 percent, primarily resulting from higher ethylene and polyethylene margins. These improvements were partially offset by:•Lower earnings from DCP Midstream, mainly due to a decrease in NGL prices.•Lower earnings from Excel Paralubes, Merey Sweeny, L.P. (MSLP) and MRC, mainly due to lower margins.•The absence of earnings from Colonial Pipeline Company, which was sold in December 2011.Net gain on dispositions decreased 88 percent in 2012, primarily resulting from 2011 gains associated with the disposition of three pipeline systems, compared with a net gain associated with the sale of Trainer Refinery and associated terminal and pipeline assets in the second quarter of 2012. For additional information, see Note 6—Assets Held for Sale or Sold, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Other income increased $90 million in 2012, primarily associated with a keep-whole payment received from a third party associated with the sale of its ownership interest in REX, gains from trading activities not directly related to our physical business, and income received from ConocoPhillips associated with shared services. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 22 percent in 2012, primarily resulting from one-time and incremental costs associated with the Separation, as well as incremental costs relating to a prior retail disposition program.Impairments in 2012 included our investments in MRC and REX, a marine terminal and associated assets, and equipment formerly associated with the canceled WRG upgrade project. Impairments in 2011 included the Trainer Refinery and associated terminal and pipeline assets. For additional information, see Note 10—Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Interest and debt expense increased $229 million in 2012, primarily due to approximately $7.8 billion of new debt issued in March and April of 2012. For additional information, see Note 13—Debt, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.See Note 21—Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for information regarding our provision for income taxes and effective tax rates.2011 vs. 2010 Sales and other operating revenues increased 34 percent in 2011, while purchased crude oil and products increased 38 percent. These increases were primarily due to higher prices for petroleum products, crude oil and NGL.Equity in earnings of affiliates increased 61 percent in 2011. The increase primarily resulted from:•Improved earnings from WRB, mainly due to higher refining margins.•Improved earnings from CPChem, primarily due to higher margins and volumes in the olefins and polyolefins business line and the startup of Q-Chem II at the end of 2010.•Improved earnings from DCP Midstream, primarily as a result of higher NGL prices.Net gain on dispositions increased $1,397 million in 2011. Gains in 2011 primarily resulted from the disposition of three pipeline systems, partially offset by the loss on sale of WRG in 2011. Gains in 2010 mainly included the gain on sale of our 50 percent interest in CFJ Properties. For additional information, see Note 6—Assets Held for Sale or Sold, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.31Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsImpairments decreased 72 percent in 2011, primarily as a result of the $1,514 million impairment of WRG in 2010, partially offset by the $467 million Trainer Refinery impairment in 2011. For additional information, see Note 10—Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Foreign currency transaction gains increased $119 million in 2011, as a result of the U.S. dollar weakening against the British pound and euro during 2011, compared with a strengthening in 2010.See Note 21—Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for information regarding our provision for income taxes and effective tax rate.32Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsSegment ResultsR&M Year Ended December 31 2012 2011 2010 Millions of DollarsNet Income (Loss) Attributable to Phillips 66 United States$3,730 3,637 1,013International(1) 211 (867) $3,729 3,848 146 Dollars Per BarrelRefining Margins Atlantic Basin/Europe$9.36 5.96 6.81Gulf Coast9.02 8.01 7.24Central Corridor25.06 19.68 7.96Western/Pacific11.04 9.13 8.10Worldwide13.42 9.70 7.38 Dollars Per GallonU.S. Average Wholesale Prices* Gasoline$3.00 2.94 2.24Distillates3.19 3.12 2.30*Excludes excise taxes.

This segment also includes power generation operations. R&M has operations mainly in the United States, Europe and Asia.2012 vs. 2011 R&M reported earnings of $3,729 million in 2012, a decrease of $119 million, or 3 percent, compared with 2011. See the “Business Environment and Executive Overview” section for information on industry crack spreads and other market factors impacting this year's results.The decrease in earnings in 2012 was primarily due to lower net gains on disposition of assets, higher impairments and increased maintenance and repair expense associated with our Bayway Refinery as a result of severe weather disruptions. These items were partially offset by improved worldwide refining margins driven by improved market conditions and optimizing access to lower-cost crude oil feedstocks. During 2012, R&M included an after-tax gain of $106 million from the sale of the Trainer Refinery and associated terminal and pipeline assets, compared with an after-tax gain of $1,595 million in 2011 on the sale of Seaway Products Pipeline Company and our ownership interest in Colonial Pipeline Company and Seaway Crude Pipeline Company. For additional information, see Note 6—Assets Held for Sale or Sold, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Additionally, during 2012, R&M results included an after-tax impairment of $564 million on our equity investment in MRC, an after-tax impairment of $27 million on the Riverhead Terminal and a $42 million after-tax impairment related to equipment formerly associated with the canceled WRG upgrade project, compared with an after-tax impairment of $303 million on the Trainer Refinery during 2011. For additional information, see Note 10—Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Our worldwide refining capacity utilization rate was 93 percent in 2012, compared with 92 percent in 2011. The current year improvement was primarily due to improved market conditions, partially offset by higher turnaround and maintenance activities, as well as severe weather disruptions.2011 vs. 2010 R&M reported earnings of $3,848 million in 2011, an increase of $3,702 million compared with 2010. The increase in 2011 was primarily due to significantly higher U.S. refining margins, higher refining volumes, higher net gains from asset sales, foreign currency gains and the absence of the 2010 WRG impairment, partially offset by lower international refining margins and the $303 million after-tax impairment and warehouse inventory write-down associated with the idling of the Trainer Refinery in 2011.In 2011, gains from asset sales of $1,627 million after tax mainly resulted from the sales of Seaway Products Pipeline Company, and our equity investments in Seaway Crude Pipeline Company and Colonial Pipeline Company. These gains were partially offset by the loss on the sale of WRG and related warehouse inventory write-downs. In 2010, gains from asset sales of $113 million after tax were mainly associated with the sale of our 50 percent interest in CFJ Properties. Our worldwide refining capacity utilization rate was 92 percent in 2011, compared with 81 percent for 2010. The 2011 rate mainly reflected lower turnaround activity and the removal of WRG from our refining capacities effective January 1, 2011, partially offset by higher planned and unplanned downtime.34Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsMidstream Year Ended December 31 2012 2011 2010 Millions of Dollars Net Income Attributable to Phillips 66*$6 403 262*Includes DCP Midstream-related earnings:$179 287 210 Dollars Per BarrelAverage Sales Prices U.S. NGL* Equity affiliates$34.24 50.64 41.28 *Based on index prices from the Mont Belvieu and Conway market hubs that are weighted by NGL component and location mix. Thousands of Barrels DailyOperating Statistics NGL extracted*201 192 184NGL fractionated**105 112 120 *Includes our share of equity affiliates. **Excludes DCP Midstream.The Midstream segment purchases raw natural gas from producers and gathers natural gas through an extensive network of pipeline gathering systems. The natural gas is then processed to extract NGL from the raw gas stream. The remaining residue gas is marketed to electric utilities, industrial users and gas marketing companies. Most of the NGL are fractionated—separated into individual components such as ethane, propane and butane—and marketed as chemical feedstock, fuel or blendstock. The Midstream segment consists of our 50 percent equity investment in DCP Midstream, as well as other NGL fractionation, trading and marketing businesses in the United States. The Midstream segment also includes our 25 percent interest in REX and a one-third direct interest in both the Southern Hills and Sand Hills pipeline projects.2012 vs. 2011 Earnings from the Midstream segment decreased $397 million in 2012, compared with 2011. The decrease was primarily due to impairments of our equity investment in REX during 2012 and decreased equity earnings from DCP Midstream, partially offset by a keep-whole payment received from a third party associated with the sale of its ownership interest in REX. During 2012, we recorded after-tax impairments totaling $303 million on our equity investment in REX. The impairments primarily reflect a diminished view of fair value of west-to-east natural gas transmission, due to the impact of shale gas production in the northeast. For additional information, see Note 10—Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The decrease in earnings of DCP Midstream in 2012 mainly resulted from lower NGL prices and, to a lesser extent, lower natural gas prices, partially offset by lower depreciation and increased gain from the issuance of limited partner units by DCP Midstream Partners, L.P., as described below, and favorable volume impacts due to higher NGL extracted from liquid rich areas (such as Permian Basin, Eagle Ford Shale and Denver-Julesburg Basin). See the “Business Environment and Executive Overview” section for additional information on NGL prices.During the second quarter of 2012, DCP Midstream completed a review of the estimated depreciable lives of its major classes of properties, plants and equipment. As a result of that review, the depreciable lives were extended. This change in accounting estimate was implemented on a prospective basis, effective April 1, 2012. DCP Midstream estimates its depreciation will be lowered approximately $240 million per year (on a 100 percent basis), which would be an estimated after-tax benefit to our equity in earnings from DCP Midstream of approximately $75 million.35Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsDCP Midstream Partners, L.P., a subsidiary of DCP Midstream, issues, from time to time, limited partner units to the public. These issuances benefited our equity in earnings from DCP Midstream by approximately $24 million after tax in 2012, compared with approximately $11 million after tax in 2011.2011 vs. 2010 Midstream earnings increased 54 percent in 2011, compared with 2010. The increase was primarily due to higher equity earnings from DCP Midstream as a result of significantly higher NGL prices. Indexed NGL prices were 23 percent higher in 2011 than in 2010. Also benefiting 2011 earnings were higher fees received for NGL fractionation services, reflecting favorably renegotiated contracts. These items were partially offset by higher costs at DCP Midstream, primarily due to higher maintenance and repair costs and increased depreciation expense.Chemicals Year Ended December 31 2012 2011 2010 Millions of Dollars Net Income Attributable to Phillips 66$823 716 486 Millions of PoundsCPChem Externally Marketed Sales Volumes* Olefins and polyolefins14,967 14,305 12,585Specialties, aromatics and styrenics6,719 6,704 6,318 21,686 21,009 18,903*Represents 100 percent of CPChem's outside sales of produced petrochemical products, as well as commission sales from equity affiliates.The Chemicals segment consists of our 50 percent interest in CPChem, which we account for under the equity method. CPChem uses NGL and other feedstocks to produce petrochemicals. These products are then marketed and sold or used as feedstocks to produce plastics and other chemicals.2012 vs. 2011 Earnings from the Chemicals segment increased $107 million, or 15 percent, in 2012, compared with 2011. The increase was primarily driven by higher ethylene and polyethylene margins and lower utility costs, partially offset by a loss on early extinguishment of debt and fixed asset impairments. Ethylene margins benefited from lower feedstock costs, particularly lower ethane and propane prices during 2012. Utility costs benefited from lower natural gas prices during 2012.During 2012, CPChem retired $1 billion of fixed-rate debt. CPChem also incurred prepayment premiums and wrote off the associated unamortized debt issuance costs. As a result, CPChem recognized a loss on early extinguishment of debt in 2012 of $287 million (100 percent basis), which decreased our equity in earnings from CPChem, on an after-tax basis, by approximately $90 million. In addition, during 2012, CPChem recorded fixed asset impairments totaling $91 million (100 percent basis), which decreased our equity in earnings from CPChem, on an after-tax basis, by $28 million. These asset impairments primarily included certain specialties, aromatics and styrenics asset groups and were mainly driven by decreases in cash flow projections. 2011 vs. 2010Chemicals segment earnings increased $230 million, or 47 percent, in 2011, compared with 2010. The improvement primarily resulted from higher margins, volumes and equity earnings from CPChem’s olefins and polyolefins business line. The specialties, aromatics and styrenics business line also contributed to the increase in earnings due to higher margins.36Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsCorporate and Other Millions of Dollars Year Ended December 31 2012 2011 2010Net Loss Attributable to Phillips 66 Net interest expense$(148) (11) —Corporate general and administrative expenses(116) (76) (71)Technology(49) (53) (44)Repositioning costs(55) — —Other(66) (52) (44) $(434) (192) (159)2012 vs. 2011Net interest expense consists of interest and financing expense, net of interest income and capitalized interest. Net interest expense increased $137 million in 2012, compared with 2011, primarily due to approximately $7.8 billion of new debt issued in March and April of 2012. For additional information, see Note 13—Debt, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Corporate general and administrative expenses increased $40 million in 2012, compared with 2011. The increase was primarily due to incremental costs and expenses associated with operating as a stand-alone company for the eight months subsequent to the Separation.Repositioning costs consist of expenses related to the Separation. Expenses incurred in the eight-month period subsequent to the Separation primarily included compensation and benefits, employee relocations and moves, information systems, and shared services costs.Changes in the ""Other"" category were mainly due to an after-tax impairment of $16 million on a corporate property in 2012.2011 vs. 2010Net interest expense increased $11 million in 2011, primarily as a result of various tax-related adjustments in 2010. Technology’s net loss increased in 2011, mainly due to higher project expenses and lower licensing revenues. The category “Other” includes certain foreign currency transaction gains and losses, environmental costs associated with sites no longer in operation, and other costs not directly associated with an operating segment. Changes in the “Other” category were mainly due to higher environmental expenses associated with sites no longer in operation.37Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsCAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITYFinancial Indicators Millions of DollarsExcept as Indicated 2012 2011 2010 Net cash provided by operating activities$4,296 5,006 2,092 Short-term debt13 30 29 Total debt6,974 391 417 Total equity20,806 23,293 26,026 Percent of total debt to capital*25% 2 2 Percent of floating-rate debt to total debt15% 13 12 *Capital includes total debt and total equity. To meet our short- and long-term liquidity requirements, we look to a variety of funding sources, but rely primarily on cash generated from operating activities. Proceeds from asset dispositions, funds from the issuance of debt, and, prior to April 30, 2012, proceeds from ConocoPhillips have also been sources of liquidity.During 2012, we generated $4.3 billion in operating cash flows and received $7.8 billion in proceeds from the issuance of debt. During 2012, the primary uses of this available cash were $1.7 billion in capital expenditures and investments; $5.3 billion of distributions to ConocoPhillips as part of the Separation; $1.2 billion of debt repayment; $0.4 billion to repurchase common stock; and $0.3 billion to pay dividends on our common stock. We ended 2012 with cash and cash equivalents of $3.5 billion.In addition to cash flows from operating activities and proceeds from asset sales, we rely on our credit facility programs and our shelf registration statement to support our short- and long-term liquidity requirements. We believe current cash and cash equivalents and cash generated by operations, together with access to external sources of funds as described below in the “Significant Sources of Capital” section, will be sufficient to meet our funding requirements in the near and long term, including our capital spending, dividend payments, defined benefit plan contributions, repayment of debt and share repurchases. Significant Sources of CapitalOperating ActivitiesDuring 2012, cash of $4,296 million was provided by operating activities, a 14 percent decrease from cash from operations of $5,006 million in 2011. The decrease in the 2012 period primarily reflects the impact of working capital changes. Accounts payable activity lowered cash from operations by $985 million in 2012, primarily reflecting lower commodity prices and volumes. Inventory management had a reduced benefit to working capital in 2012, compared with 2011 (discussed in more detail below). Partially offsetting the negative impact of working capital changes in 2012 were:•Improved U.S. refining margins during 2012, reflecting improved market conditions and increasing access to lower-cost crude oil feedstocks.•Increased distributions from equity affiliates, particularly WRB, whose refineries are located in the Central Corridor region.During 2011, cash of $5,006 million was provided by operating activities, a 139 percent increase from cash from operations of $2,092 million in 2010. The increase was primarily due to a significant improvement in U.S. refining margins in 2011, particularly in the Central Corridor region; increased distributions from equity affiliates, including CPChem, DCP Midstream and WRB; and inventory liquidations in 2011, compared with inventory builds in 2010.Our short- and long-term operating cash flows are highly dependent upon refining and marketing margins, NGL prices, and chemicals margins. Prices and margins in our industry are typically volatile, and are driven by market conditions over which we have little or no control. Absent other mitigating factors, as these prices and margins fluctuate, we would expect a corresponding change in our operating cash flows.38Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsGenerally, demand for gasoline is higher during the spring and summer months than during the fall and winter months in most of our markets due to seasonal changes in highway traffic. As a result, the R&M segment's operating results in the first and fourth quarters are generally lower than in the second and third quarters. However, our cash flow from operations may not always follow this seasonal trend in operating results, due to working capital fluctuations associated with inventory management. Historically, we have built inventory levels during the first quarter (thus lowering cash flow from operations) and lowered inventory levels in the fourth quarter (increasing cash flow from operations). In 2012, we used operating cash flows of $1.5 billion in the first quarter to build inventories, while the liquidation of inventories in the fourth quarter provided operating cash flows of $2.3 billion. For the full year 2012, inventory management had a lower benefit to cash from operations, compared with 2011, reflecting that a portion of our normal fourth-quarter inventory draw took place late in the year, such that cash realizations did not transpire prior to December 31.The level and quality of output from our refineries also impacts our cash flows. The output at our refineries is impacted by such factors as operating efficiency, maintenance turnarounds, market conditions, feedstock availability and weather conditions. We actively manage the operations of our refineries and, typically, any variability in their operations has not been as significant to cash flows as that caused by margins and prices. Our worldwide crude oil throughput capacity utilization was 93 percent in 2012, compared with 92 percent in 2011. We are forecasting 2013 utilization to remain in the low 90-percent range. As part of our normal process, we made a scheduled U.S. federal income tax payment in the fourth quarter of 2012 using the IRS safe harbor method for estimated 2012 taxable income. We determined that a portion of that payment is refundable as an overpayment of estimated tax, and we intend to file for a ""quick refund"" with the IRS in the first quarter of 2013. We expect this refund to benefit cash from operations in the first quarter of 2013 by approximately $350 million. Our operating cash flows are also impacted by distribution decisions made by our equity affiliates, including WRB, DCP Midstream and CPChem. Over the three years ended December 31, 2012, we received distributions of $1,932 million from WRB, $884 million from DCP Midstream and $1,380 million from CPChem. We cannot control the amount of future distributions from equity affiliates; therefore future distributions by these and other equity affiliates are not assured.Asset SalesProceeds from asset sales in 2012 were $286 million, compared with $2,627 million in 2011 and $662 million in 2010. The 2012 proceeds from asset sales included the sale of our refinery and associated terminal and pipeline assets located in Trainer, Pennsylvania, as well as the sale of our Riverhead Terminal located in Riverhead, New York. The 2011 proceeds from asset sales included the sale of our ownership interests in Colonial Pipeline Company and Seaway Crude Pipeline Company, as well as the Wilhelmshaven Refinery and Seaway Products Pipeline Company. The 2010 proceeds included the sale of our 50 percent interest in CFJ Properties.Credit FacilitiesIn February 2012, we entered into a five-year revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of financial institutions. Under the terms of the revolving credit agreement, we have a borrowing capacity of up to $4.0 billion. We have not borrowed under this facility. However, as of December 31, 2012, $51 million in letters of credit had been issued that were supported by this facility.The revolving credit agreement contains covenants that we consider usual and customary for an agreement of this type for comparable commercial borrowers, including a maximum consolidated net debt-to-capitalization ratio of 60 percent. The agreement has customary events of default, such as nonpayment of principal when due; nonpayment of interest, fees or other amounts; violation of covenants; cross-payment default and cross-acceleration (in each case, to indebtedness in excess of a threshold amount); and a change of control.Borrowings under the credit agreement will incur interest at the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a margin based on the credit rating of our senior unsecured long-term debt as determined from time to time by Standard & Poor's Ratings Services (S&P) and Moody's Investors Service (Moody's). The revolving credit agreement also provides for customary fees, including administrative agent fees and commitment fees. During April 2012, a newly formed, wholly owned subsidiary entered into a trade receivables securitization facility. The facility has a term of three years and an aggregate capacity of $1.2 billion. As of December 31, 2012, we had not borrowed under the facility, but we had obtained $166 million in letters of credit under the facility that were collateralized by $166 million of the trade receivables held by the subsidiary.39Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsDebt FinancingsDuring March 2012, we issued, through a private placement, $5.8 billion of debt consisting of: •$0.8 billion aggregate principal amount of 1.950% Senior Notes due 2015.•$1.5 billion aggregate principal amount of 2.950% Senior Notes due 2017.•$2.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 4.300% Senior Notes due 2022.•$1.5 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.875% Senior Notes due 2042.The notes are guaranteed by Phillips 66 Company, a wholly owned subsidiary. In connection with the private placement, we and Phillips 66 Company entered into a Registration Rights Agreement with the initial purchasers of the notes pursuant to which we agreed, for the benefit of the holders of the notes, to use our commercially reasonable efforts to file with the SEC and cause to be effective a registration statement with respect to a registered offer to exchange each series of notes for new notes that are guaranteed by Phillips 66 Company with terms substantially identical in all material respects to such series of notes.On November 5, 2012, we filed a registration statement on Form S-4 with the SEC in accordance with the Registration Rights Agreement outlining our offer to exchange our $5.8 billion senior notes for substantially identical notes without transfer restrictions. The registration statement was declared effective on November 15, 2012, and the exchange offer for the notes was completed in January 2013 with 99.9 percent participation.During April 2012, approximately $185 million of previously existing debt was retired. Also during April, we closed on $2.0 billion of new debt in the form of a three-year amortizing term loan. The term loan bears interest at a variable rate based on referenced rates plus a margin dependent upon the credit rating of our senior unsecured long-term debt as determined from time to time by S&P and Moody's. As of December 31, 2012, the interest rate was 1.47 percent. In December 2012, we made a $1.0 billion pre-payment on the term loan.Our senior unsecured long-term debt has been rated investment grade by S&P and Moody's. We do not have any ratings triggers on any of our corporate debt that would cause an automatic default, and thereby impact our access to liquidity, in the event of a downgrade of our credit rating. If our credit rating deteriorated to a level prohibiting us from accessing the commercial paper market, we would expect to be able to access funds under our $5.2 billion in liquidity facilities mentioned above.Shelf RegistrationWe have a universal shelf registration statement on file with the SEC under which we, as a well-known seasoned issuer, have the ability to issue and sell an indeterminate amount of various types of debt and equity securities.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsAs part of our normal ongoing business operations, we enter into agreements with other parties to pursue business opportunities, which share costs and apportion risks among the parties as governed by the agreements. In April 2012, in connection with the Separation, we entered into an agreement to guarantee 100 percent of certain outstanding debt obligations of MSLP. At December 31, 2012, the aggregate principal amount of MSLP debt guaranteed by us was $233 million. For additional information about guarantees, see Note 14—Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Capital RequirementsFor information about our capital expenditures and investments, see “Capital Spending” below.Our debt balance at December 31, 2012, was $7.0 billion and our debt-to-capital ratio was 25 percent, within our target range of 20-to-30 percent. In December 2012, we made a $1.0 billion pre-payment on our $2.0 billion term loan. As a result of this prepayment, we have no material scheduled debt maturities in 2013. However, we expect to repay the remaining $1.0 billion of the term loan before year-end 2013.On February 10, 2013, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.3125 per common share, payable March 1, 2013, to holders of record at the close of business on February 21, 2013. This represented a 25 percent increase over our fourth-quarter 2012 dividend rate of $0.25 per share and a 56 percent increase over our initial dividend rate after the Separation of $0.20 per share.40Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsOn July 31, 2012, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $1 billion of our outstanding common stock. On December 7, 2012, our Board authorized an additional $1 billion share repurchase, bringing the total repurchase program to $2 billion. We began purchases under this program, which has no expiration date, in the third quarter of 2012. The shares are repurchased in the open market at the company's discretion, subject to market conditions and other factors, and in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements and the Tax Sharing Agreement entered into in connection with the Separation. We are not obligated to acquire any particular amount of common stock and may commence, suspend or discontinue purchases at any time or from time to time without prior notice. Through December 31, 2012, $356 million was used to repurchase 7,603,896 shares. Shares of stock repurchased are held as treasury shares.Contractual ObligationsThe following table summarizes our aggregate contractual fixed and variable obligations as of December 31, 2012.

We expect these purchase obligations will be fulfilled by operating cash flows in the applicable maturity period. The majority of the purchase obligations are market-based contracts, including exchanges and futures, for the purchase of products such as crude oil and unfractionated NGL. The products are mostly used to supply our refineries and fractionators, optimize the supply chain, and resell to customers. Product purchase commitments with third parties totaled $82,634 million. In addition, $40,478 million are product purchases from CPChem, mostly for natural gas and NGL over the remaining contractual term of 87 years, and $7,245 million from Excel Paralubes, for base oil over the remaining contractual term of 12 years.Purchase obligations of $1,155 million are related to agreements to access and utilize the capacity of third-party equipment and facilities, including pipelines and product terminals, to transport, process, treat, and store products. The remainder is primarily our net share of purchase commitments for materials and services for jointly owned facilities where we are the operator.(c)Excludes pensions. For the 2013 through 2017 time period, we expect to contribute an average of $170 million per year to our qualified and nonqualified pension and other postretirement benefit plans in the United States and an average of $55 million per year to our non-U.S. plans, which are expected to be in excess of required minimums in many cases. The U.S. five-year average consists of $65 million for 2013 and then approximately $200 million per year for the remaining four years. Our minimum funding in 2013 is expected to be $65 million in the United States and $55 million outside the United States.(d)Excludes unrecognized tax benefits of $148 million because the ultimate disposition and timing of any payments to be made with regard to such amounts are not reasonably estimable or the amounts relate to potential refunds. Also 41Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statementsexcludes interest and penalties of $15 million. Although unrecognized tax benefits are not a contractual obligation, they are presented in this table because they represent potential demands on our liquidity.Capital Spending Millions of Dollars 2013Budget 2012 2011 2010Capital Expenditures and Investments R&M United States$1,034 833 751 798International*353 221 237 276 1,387 1,054 988 1,074Midstream**361 527 17 68Chemicals— — — —Corporate and Other161 140 17 8Total consolidated$1,909 1,721 1,022 1,150 WRB$112 136 414 644DCP Midstream**1,100 1,324 779 411CPChem549 371 222 185Selected equity affiliates***$1,761 1,831 1,415 1,240 *2013 budget amount includes non-cash capital lease of $152 million. **2012 consolidated amount includes acquisition of a one-third interest in the Sand Hills and Southern Hills pipeline projects from DCP Midstream for $459 million. This amount was also included in DCP Midstream's capital spending, primarily in 2012.***Our share of capital spending which is self-funded by the equity affiliate.R&MCapital spending for the R&M segment during the three-year period ended December 31, 2012, was primarily for air emission reduction and clean fuels projects to meet new environmental standards, refinery upgrade projects to improve product yields and increase advantaged crude oil processing capability, improvements to the operating integrity of key processing units and safety-related projects. During this three-year period, R&M capital spending was $3.1 billion.Key projects completed during the three-year period included: •Installation of facilities to reduce emissions from the fluid catalytic cracker at the Sweeny Refinery.•Installation of facilities to reduce nitrous oxide emissions from the crude furnace and installation of a new high-efficiency vacuum furnace at Bayway Refinery.•Completion of gasoline benzene reduction projects at the Alliance, Bayway, and Ponca City refineries.•Installation of new coke drums at the Billings Refinery.•Installation of a new carbon monoxide boiler at the Bayway Refinery to control carbon monoxide emissions while providing steam production.Major construction activities in progress include: •Installation of facilities to reduce nitrous oxide emissions from the fluid catalytic cracker at the Alliance Refinery.•Installation of new coke drums at the Ponca City Refinery.•Installation of a tail gas treating unit at the Humber Refinery to reduce emissions from the sulfur recovery units.Generally, our equity affiliates in the R&M segment are intended to have self-funding capital programs. Although WRB did not require capital infusions from us during the three-year period ended December 31, 2012, we did provide loan financing to WRB to assist it in meeting its operating and capital spending requirements. WRB repaid these loans in full during 2011. During this three-year period, on a 100 percent basis, WRB’s capital expenditures and investments were $2.4 billion. We expect WRB’s 2013 capital program to be self-funding.42Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsMidstreamDuring the three-year period ended December 31, 2012, DCP Midstream had a self-funded capital program, and thus required no new capital infusions from us or our co-venturer, Spectra Energy Corp. During this three-year period, on a 100 percent basis, DCP Midstream’s capital expenditures and investments were $5.0 billion. In November 2012, we acquired a one-third direct interest in both the Sand Hills and Southern Hills pipeline projects, which currently are under construction and operated by DCP Midstream. Phillips 66, Spectra Energy and DCP Midstream now each own a one-third interest in the two pipeline projects. Our direct investment, in total, was $0.5 billion.Other capital spending in our Midstream segment not related to DCP Midstream over the three-year period was primarily for investment in the construction of the Rockies Express pipeline, a natural gas transmission line running from Colorado to Ohio.ChemicalsDuring the three-year period ended December 31, 2012, CPChem had a self-funded capital program, and thus required no new capital infusions from us or our co-venturer. During the three-year period, on a 100 percent basis, CPChem’s capital expenditures and investments were $1.6 billion. In addition, CPChem's advances to equity affiliates, primarily used for project construction and start-up activities, were $0.4 billion and its repayments received from equity affiliates were $0.3 billion. Our agreement with Chevron Corporation regarding CPChem provided for CPChem to: (i) prior to the Separation, halt all mandatory cash distributions to its owners and accumulate its excess cash; and (ii) after the Separation, use the accumulated cash and its excess cash flow to retire all of its approximately $1.0 billion outstanding fixed-rate debt on an accelerated basis. In the third quarter of 2012, CPChem completed the redemption of all outstanding fixed-rate debt, and it resumed cash distributions to its owners in the fourth quarter. After the Separation, the agreement generally provided that instead of CPChem incurring debt, CPChem's owners would make capital infusions as necessary to fund CPChem's capital requirements to the extent these requirements exceed CPChem's available cash from operations. We are currently forecasting CPChem to remain self-funding through 2013. 2013 BudgetOur 2013 planned capital budget is $1.9 billion. This excludes our portion of planned capital spending by DCP Midstream, CPChem and WRB totaling $1.8 billion, which is not expected to require cash outlays by us. Our 2013 budgeted consolidated capital expenditures and investments represent an 11 percent increase over our 2012 consolidated capital spending of $1.7 billion. R&M is expected to spend $1.4 billion in 2013, primarily directed toward reliability, maintenance, safety and environmental projects, as well as targeted growth and optimization spending. Approximately $1.0 billion of this amount is attributable to projects in the United States. The Midstream budget includes additional investment related to our one-third direct interest in the Sand Hills and Southern Hills pipelines. Within Corporate and Other, we expect to invest approximately $0.2 billion in 2013 related to information technology, facilities, and research and development. ContingenciesA number of lawsuits involving a variety of claims have been made against us in connection with matters that arise in the ordinary course of business. We also may be required to remove or mitigate the effects on the environment of the placement, storage, disposal or release of certain chemical, mineral and petroleum substances at various active and inactive sites. We regularly assess the need for accounting recognition or disclosure of these contingencies. In the case of all known contingencies (other than those related to income taxes), we accrue a liability when the loss is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable. If a range of amounts can be reasonably estimated and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount, then the minimum of the range is accrued. We do not reduce these liabilities for potential insurance or third-party recoveries. If applicable, we accrue receivables for probable insurance or other third-party recoveries. In the case of income-tax-related contingencies, we use a cumulative probability-weighted loss accrual in cases where sustaining a tax position is less than certain.Based on currently available information, we believe it is remote that future costs related to known contingent liability exposures will exceed current accruals by an amount that would have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements. As we learn new facts concerning contingencies, we reassess our position both with respect to accrued liabilities and other potential exposures. Estimates particularly sensitive to future changes include contingent liabilities recorded for environmental remediation, tax and legal matters. Estimated future environmental remediation costs are subject to change due to such factors as the uncertain magnitude of cleanup costs, the unknown time and extent of such remedial actions that may be required, and the determination of our liability in proportion to that of other responsible parties. Estimated future costs related to tax and legal matters are subject to change as events evolve and as additional information becomes available during the administrative and litigation processes.43Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsLegal and Tax MattersOur legal organization applies its knowledge, experience and professional judgment to the specific characteristics of our cases, employing a litigation management process to manage and monitor the legal proceedings against us. Our process facilitates the early evaluation and quantification of potential exposures in individual cases. This process also enables us to track those cases that have been scheduled for trial and/or mediation. Based on professional judgment and experience in using these litigation management tools and available information about current developments in all our cases, our legal organization regularly assesses the adequacy of current accruals and determines if adjustment of existing accruals, or establishment of new accruals, are required. See Note 21—Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information about income-tax-related contingencies.EnvironmentalWe are subject to the same numerous international, federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations as other companies in our industry. The most significant of these environmental laws and regulations include, among others, the: •U.S. Federal Clean Air Act, which governs air emissions.•U.S. Federal Clean Water Act, which governs discharges to water bodies.•European Union Regulation for Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH).•U.S. Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), which imposes liability on generators, transporters and arrangers of hazardous substances at sites where hazardous substance releases have occurred or are threatening to occur.•U.S. Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), which governs the treatment, storage and disposal of solid waste.•U.S. Federal Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA), which requires facilities to report toxic chemical inventories to local emergency planning committees and response departments.•U.S. Federal Safe Drinking Water Act, which governs the disposal of wastewater in underground injection wells.•U.S. Federal Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA90), under which owners and operators of onshore facilities and pipelines, lessees or permittees of an area in which an offshore facility is located, and owners and operators of vessels are liable for removal costs and damages that result from a discharge of oil into navigable waters of the United States.•European Union Trading Directive resulting in the European Emissions Trading Scheme.These laws and their implementing regulations set limits on emissions and, in the case of discharges to water, establish water quality limits. They also, in most cases, require permits in association with new or modified operations. These permits can require an applicant to collect substantial information in connection with the application process, which can be expensive and time consuming. In addition, there can be delays associated with notice and comment periods and the agency’s processing of the application. Many of the delays associated with the permitting process are beyond the control of the applicant.Many states and foreign countries where we operate also have, or are developing, similar environmental laws and regulations governing these same types of activities. While similar, in some cases these regulations may impose additional, or more stringent, requirements that can add to the cost and difficulty of marketing or transporting products across state and international borders.The ultimate financial impact arising from environmental laws and regulations is neither clearly known nor easily determinable as new standards, such as air emission standards, water quality standards and stricter fuel regulations, continue to evolve. However, environmental laws and regulations, including those that may arise to address concerns about global climate change, are expected to continue to have an increasing impact on our operations in the United States and in other countries in which we operate. Notable areas of potential impacts include air emission compliance and remediation obligations in the United States.An example in the fuels area is the Energy Policy Act of 2005, which imposed obligations to provide increasing volumes of renewable fuels in transportation motor fuels through 2012. These obligations were changed with the enactment of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA). The 2007 law requires fuel producers and importers to provide additional renewable fuels for transportation motor fuels and stipulates a mix of various types to be included through 2022. We have met the increasingly stringent requirements to date while establishing implementation, operating and capital strategies, along with advanced technology development, to address projected future requirements. It is uncertain how various future requirements contained in EISA, and the regulations promulgated thereunder, may be implemented and what their full impact may be on our operations. Also, we may experience a decrease in demand for refined petroleum products due to the regulatory program as currently promulgated.44Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsWe also are subject to certain laws and regulations relating to environmental remediation obligations associated with current and past operations. Such laws and regulations include CERCLA and RCRA and their state equivalents. Remediation obligations include cleanup responsibility arising from petroleum releases from underground storage tanks located at numerous past and present owned and/or operated petroleum-marketing outlets throughout the United States. Federal and state laws require contamination caused by such underground storage tank releases be assessed and remediated to meet applicable standards. In addition to other cleanup standards, many states have adopted cleanup criteria for methyl tertiary-butyl ether (MTBE) for both soil and groundwater.At RCRA-permitted facilities, we are required to assess environmental conditions. If conditions warrant, we may be required to remediate contamination caused by prior operations. In contrast to CERCLA, which is often referred to as “Superfund,” the cost of corrective action activities under RCRA corrective action programs typically is borne solely by us. We anticipate increased expenditures for RCRA remediation activities may be required, but such annual expenditures for the near term are not expected to vary significantly from the range of such expenditures we have experienced over the past few years. Longer-term expenditures are subject to considerable uncertainty and may fluctuate significantly.We occasionally receive requests for information or notices of potential liability from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and state environmental agencies alleging we are a potentially responsible party under CERCLA or an equivalent state statute. On occasion, we also have been made a party to cost recovery litigation by those agencies or by private parties. These requests, notices and lawsuits assert potential liability for remediation costs at various sites that typically are not owned by us, but allegedly contain wastes attributable to our past operations. As of December 31, 2011, we reported we had been notified of potential liability under CERCLA and comparable state laws at 61 sites around the United States. At December 31, 2012, we had been notified of 1 new site, settled 3 sites and 11 sites were resolved and closed, leaving 48 sites with potential liability. For most Superfund sites, our potential liability will be significantly less than the total site remediation costs because the percentage of waste attributable to us, versus that attributable to all other potentially responsible parties, is relatively low. Although liability of those potentially responsible is generally joint and several for federal sites and frequently so for state sites, other potentially responsible parties at sites where we are a party typically have had the financial strength to meet their obligations, and where they have not, or where potentially responsible parties could not be located, our share of liability has not increased materially. Many of the sites at which we are potentially responsible are still under investigation by the EPA or the state agencies concerned. Prior to actual cleanup, those potentially responsible normally assess site conditions, apportion responsibility and determine the appropriate remediation. In some instances, we may have no liability or attain a settlement of liability. Actual cleanup costs generally occur after the parties obtain EPA or equivalent state agency approval of a remediation plan. There are relatively few sites where we are a major participant, and given the timing and amounts of anticipated expenditures, neither the cost of remediation at those sites nor such costs at all CERCLA sites, in the aggregate, is expected to have a material adverse effect on our competitive or financial condition.Expensed environmental costs were $645 million in 2012 and are expected to be approximately $650 million per year in 2013 and 2014. Capitalized environmental costs were $264 million in 2012 and are expected to be approximately $320 million per year in 2013 and 2014. This amount does not include capital expenditures made for another purpose that have an indirect benefit on environmental compliance.Accrued liabilities for remediation activities are not reduced for potential recoveries from insurers or other third parties and are not discounted (except those assumed in a purchase business combination, which we do record on a discounted basis).Many of these liabilities result from CERCLA, RCRA and similar state laws that require us to undertake certain investigative and remedial activities at sites where we conduct, or once conducted, operations or at sites where our generated waste was disposed. We also have accrued for a number of sites we identified that may require environmental remediation, but which are not currently the subject of CERCLA, RCRA or state enforcement activities. If applicable, we accrue receivables for probable insurance or other third-party recoveries. In the future, we may incur significant costs under both CERCLA and RCRA. Remediation activities vary substantially in duration and cost from site to site, depending on the mix of unique site characteristics, evolving remediation technologies, diverse regulatory agencies and enforcement policies, and the presence or absence of potentially liable third parties. Therefore, it is difficult to develop reasonable estimates of future site remediation costs.At December 31, 2012, our balance sheet included total accrued environmental costs of $530 million, compared with $542 million at December 31, 2011, and $554 million at December 31, 2010. We expect to incur a substantial amount of these expenditures within the next 30 years.Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, and as with other companies engaged in similar businesses, environmental costs and liabilities are inherent concerns in our operations and products, and there can be no assurance that material costs and liabilities 45Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statementswill not be incurred. However, we currently do not expect any material adverse effect upon our results of operations or financial position as a result of compliance with current environmental laws and regulations.The EPA’s Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) program was implemented in accordance with the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and the EISA. The RFS program sets annual quotas for the percentage of biofuels (such as ethanol) that must be blended into motor fuels consumed in the United States. A Renewable Identification Number (RIN) represents a serial number assigned to each gallon of biofuel produced or imported into the United States. As a producer of petroleum-based motor fuels, we are obligated to blend biofuels into the products we produce at a rate that is at least equal to the EPA’s quota and, to the extent we do not, we must purchase RINs in the open market to satisfy our obligation under the RFS program. The market for RINs has been the subject of fraudulent activity, and we have identified that we have unknowingly purchased RINs in the past that were invalid due to fraudulent activity. Although costs to replace fraudulently marketed RINs that have been determined to be invalid have not been material through December 31, 2012, it is reasonably possible that some additional RINs that we have previously purchased may also be determined to be invalid. Should that occur, we could incur additional replacement charges. Although the cost for replacing any additional fraudulently marketed RINs is not reasonably estimable at this time, we could have a possible exposure of approximately $150 million before tax. It could take several years for this possible exposure to reach ultimate resolution; therefore, we would not expect to incur the full financial impact of additional fraudulent RIN replacement costs in any single interim or annual period.Climate ChangeThere has been a broad range of proposed or promulgated state, national and international laws focusing on greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction. These proposed or promulgated laws apply or could apply in countries where we have interests or may have interests in the future. Laws in this field continue to evolve, and while it is not possible to accurately estimate either a timetable for implementation or our future compliance costs relating to implementation, such laws, if enacted, could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition. Examples of legislation or precursors for possible regulation that do or could affect our operations include: •European Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS), the program through which many of the European Union (EU) member states are implementing the Kyoto Protocol.•California’s Global Warming Solutions Act, which requires the California Air Resources Board to develop regulations and market mechanisms that will target reduction of California’s GHG emissions by 25 percent by 2020.•The U.S. Supreme Court decision in Massachusetts v. EPA, 549 U.S. 497, 127 S.Ct. 1438 (2007), confirming that the EPA has the authority to regulate carbon dioxide as an “air pollutant” under the Federal Clean Air Act.•The EPA’s announcement on March 29, 2010 (published as “Interpretation of Regulations that Determine Pollutants Covered by Clean Air Act Permitting Programs,” 75 Fed. Reg. 17004 (April 2, 2010)), and the EPA’s and U.S. Department of Transportation’s joint promulgation of a Final Rule on April 1, 2010, that triggers regulation of GHGs under the Clean Air Act. These collectively may lead to more climate-based claims for damages, and may result in longer agency review time for development projects to determine the extent of potential climate change. Challenges to both the announcement and rulemaking were denied by the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit (see Coalition for Responsible Regulation v. EPA, 684 F. 3d 102 (D.C. Cir. 2012)), but may be subject to additional legal actions. •Carbon taxes in certain jurisdictions.•GHG emission cap and trade programs in certain jurisdictions. In the EU, we have assets that are subject to the ETS. The first phase of the ETS was completed at the end of 2007 and Phase II ran from 2008 through 2012. Phase III will run from 2013 through 2020 and there will likely be a significant increase in auctioning levels, including 100 percent auctioning to the power sector in the UK and across most of the EU. We are actively engaged to minimize any financial impact from the trading scheme. In the United States, some additional form of regulation may be forthcoming in the future at the federal or state levels with respect to GHG emissions. Such regulation could take any of several forms that may result in the creation of additional costs in the form of taxes, the restriction of output, investments of capital to maintain compliance with laws and regulations, or required acquisition or trading of emission allowances. We are working to continuously improve operational and energy efficiency through resource and energy conservation throughout our operations.Compliance with changes in laws and regulations that create a GHG emission trading scheme or GHG reduction policies could significantly increase our costs, reduce demand for fossil energy derived products, impact the cost and availability of capital and increase our exposure to litigation. Such laws and regulations could also increase demand for less carbon intensive energy sources. An example of one such program is California's cap and trade program, which was promulgated pursuant to the State's Global Warming Solutions Act. The program currently is limited to certain stationary sources, which include our refineries in 46Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsCalifornia, but beginning in 2015 will expand to include emissions from transportation fuels distributed in California. We expect inclusion of transportation fuels in California's cap and trade program as currently promulgated would increase our cap and trade program compliance costs. The ultimate impact on our financial performance, either positive or negative, from this and similar programs, will depend on a number of factors, including but not limited to: •Whether and to what extent legislation is enacted.•The nature of the legislation (such as a cap and trade system or a tax on emissions).•The GHG reductions required.•The price and availability of offsets.•The amount and allocation of allowances.•Technological and scientific developments leading to new products or services.•Any potential significant physical effects of climate change (such as increased severe weather events, changes in sea levels and changes in temperature).•Whether, and the extent to which, increased compliance costs are ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services.CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATESThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to select appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. See Note 2—Accounting Policies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for descriptions of our major accounting policies. Certain of these accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent that there is a reasonable likelihood that materially different amounts would have been reported under different conditions, or if different assumptions had been used. The following discussions of critical accounting estimates, along with the discussion of contingencies in this report, address all important accounting areas where the nature of accounting estimates or assumptions could be material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change.ImpairmentsLong-lived assets used in operations are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate a possible significant deterioration in future cash flows is expected to be generated by an asset group. If, upon review, the sum of the undiscounted pre-tax cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset group, the carrying value is written down to estimated fair value. Individual assets are grouped for impairment purposes based on a judgmental assessment of the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets—generally at an entire refinery complex level. Because there usually is a lack of quoted market prices for long-lived assets, the fair value of impaired assets is typically determined based on the present values of expected future cash flows using discount rates believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants, or based on a multiple of operating cash flows validated with historical market transactions of similar assets where possible. The expected future cash flows used for impairment reviews and related fair value calculations are based on judgmental assessments of future volumes, commodity prices, operating costs, margins, discount rates and capital project decisions, considering all available information at the date of review.Investments in nonconsolidated entities accounted for under the equity method are reviewed for impairment when there is evidence of a loss in value. Such evidence of a loss in value might include our inability to recover the carrying amount, the lack of sustained earnings capacity which would justify the current investment amount, or a current fair value less than the investment’s carrying amount. When it is determined such a loss in value is other than temporary, an impairment charge is recognized for the difference between the investment’s carrying value and its estimated fair value. When determining whether a decline in value is other than temporary, management considers factors such as the length of time and extent of the decline, the investee’s financial condition and near-term prospects, and our ability and intention to retain our investment for a period that will be sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in the market value of the investment. When quoted market prices are not available, the fair value is usually based on the present value of expected future cash flows using discount rates believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants, plus market analysis of comparable assets owned by the investee, if appropriate. Differing assumptions could affect the timing and the amount of an impairment of an investment in any period.47Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsAsset Retirement ObligationsUnder various contracts, permits and regulations, we have material legal obligations to remove tangible equipment and restore the land at the end of operations at certain operational sites. Our largest asset removal obligations involve asbestos abatement at refineries. Estimating the future asset removal costs necessary for this accounting calculation is difficult. Most of these removal obligations are many years, or decades, in the future and the contracts and regulations often have vague descriptions of what removal practices and criteria must be met when the removal event actually occurs. Asset removal technologies and costs, regulatory and other compliance considerations, expenditure timing, and other inputs into valuation of the obligation, including discount and inflation rates, are also subject to change.Environmental CostsIn addition to asset retirement obligations discussed above, under the above or similar contracts, permits and regulations, we have certain obligations to complete environmental-related projects. These projects are primarily related to cleanup at domestic refineries, underground storage sites and non-operated sites. Future environmental remediation costs are difficult to estimate because they are subject to change due to such factors as the uncertain magnitude of cleanup costs, the unknown time and extent of such remedial actions that may be required, and the determination of our liability in proportion to that of other responsible parties.Intangible Assets and GoodwillAt December 31, 2012, we had $701 million of intangible assets determined to have indefinite useful lives, and thus they are not amortized. This judgmental assessment of an indefinite useful life must be continuously evaluated in the future. If, due to changes in facts and circumstances, management determines these intangible assets have finite useful lives, amortization will commence at that time on a prospective basis. As long as these intangible assets are judged to have indefinite lives, they will be subject to annual lower-of-cost-or-fair value tests that require management’s judgment of the estimated fair value of these intangible assets.At December 31, 2012, we had $3.3 billion of goodwill recorded in conjunction with past business combinations. Under the accounting rules for goodwill, this intangible asset is not amortized. Instead, goodwill is subject to at least annual reviews for impairment at a reporting unit level. The reporting unit or units used to evaluate and measure goodwill for impairment are determined primarily from the manner in which the business is managed. A reporting unit is an operating segment or a component that is one level below an operating segment. We determined we had one reporting unit for purposes of assigning goodwill and testing for impairment—the R&M operating segment. We have concluded the refining and marketing components within the R&M segment are economically similar enough to be aggregated into one reporting unit.If we later reorganize our businesses or management structure so that our operating segments change, or such that the components within our reporting unit are no longer economically similar, the reporting units would be revised and goodwill would be reassigned using a relative fair value approach. Goodwill impairment testing at a lower reporting unit level could result in the recognition of impairment that would not otherwise be recognized at the current level. In addition, the sale or disposition of a portion of our reporting unit will be allocated a portion of the reporting unit’s goodwill, based on relative fair values, which will adjust the amount of gain or loss on the sale or disposition.Because quoted market prices for our reporting unit are not available, management must apply judgment in determining the estimated fair value of this reporting unit for purposes of performing the goodwill impairment test. Management uses all available information to make this fair value determination, including the present values of expected future cash flows using discount rates commensurate with the risks involved in the assets and observed market multiples of operating cash flows and net income. In addition, if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the book value (including the goodwill), further management judgment must be applied in determining the fair values of individual assets and liabilities for purposes of the hypothetical purchase price allocation. At year-end 2012, the estimated fair value of our R&M operating segment (reporting unit) was approximately 30 percent higher than recorded net book values (including goodwill) of the reporting unit. However, a lower fair value estimate in the future could result in an impairment. Our common stock price and associated total company market capitalization are also considered in the determination of reporting unit fair value. A prolonged or significant decline in our stock price could provide evidence of a need to record a material impairment of goodwill.48Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsTax Assets and LiabilitiesOur operations are subject to various taxes, including federal, state and foreign income taxes and transactional taxes such as excise, sales/use, property and payroll taxes. We record tax liabilities based on our assessment of existing tax laws and regulations. The recording of tax liabilities may require significant judgment and estimates. We recognize the financial statement effects of an income tax position when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination by a taxing authority. A contingent liability related to a transactional tax claim is recorded if the loss is both probable and estimable. Actual incurred tax liabilities can vary from our estimates for a variety of reasons, including different interpretations of tax laws and regulations and different assessments of the amount of tax due.In determining our income tax provision, we must assess the likelihood our deferred tax assets will be recovered through future taxable income. Valuation allowances reduce deferred tax assets to an amount that will, more likely than not, be realized. Judgment is required in estimating the amount of valuation allowance, if any, that should be recorded against our deferred tax assets. Based on our historical taxable income, our expectations for the future, and available tax-planning strategies, we expect the net deferred tax assets will more likely than not be realized as offsets to reversing deferred tax liabilities and as reductions to future taxable income. If our actual results of operations differ from such estimates or our estimates of future taxable income change, the valuation allowance may need to be revised.New tax laws and regulations, as well as changes to existing tax laws and regulations, are continuously being proposed or promulgated. The implementation of future legislative and regulatory tax initiatives could result in increased tax liabilities that cannot be predicted at this time.Projected Benefit Obligations Determination of the projected benefit obligations for our defined benefit pension and postretirement plans are important to the recorded amounts for such obligations on the balance sheet and to the amount of benefit expense in the income statement. The actuarial determination of projected benefit obligations and company contribution requirements involves judgment about uncertain future events, including estimated retirement dates, salary levels at retirement, mortality rates, lump-sum election rates, rates of return on plan assets, future health care cost-trend rates, and rates of utilization of health care services by retirees. Due to the specialized nature of these calculations, we engage outside actuarial firms to assist in the determination of these projected benefit obligations and company contribution requirements. Due to differing objectives and requirements between financial accounting rules and the pension plan funding regulations promulgated by governmental agencies, the actuarial methods and assumptions for the two purposes differ in certain important respects. Ultimately, we will be required to fund all promised benefits under pension and postretirement benefit plans not funded by plan assets or investment returns, but the judgmental assumptions used in the actuarial calculations significantly affect periodic financial statements and funding patterns over time. Benefit expense is particularly sensitive to the discount rate and return on plan assets assumptions. A 1 percent decrease in the discount rate assumption would increase annual benefit expense by an estimated $60 million, while a 1 percent decrease in the return on plan assets assumption would increase annual benefit expense by an estimated $20 million. In determining the discount rate, we use yields on high-quality fixed income investments with payments matched to the estimated distributions of benefits from our plans.OUTLOOKIn December 2012, we announced our intention to contribute a portion of our transportation and logistics assets to form a master limited partnership (MLP). We are evaluating assets for contribution to the MLP, including certain petroleum product and crude oil pipelines and terminals. A registration statement for an initial public offering (IPO) is expected to be filed with the SEC in the second quarter of 2013. Subject to market conditions and final approval by our Board of Directors, we anticipate selling a minority interest in the MLP in an IPO in the second half of 2013.49Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsItem 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKFinancial Instrument Market RiskWe and certain of our subsidiaries hold and issue derivative contracts and financial instruments that expose our cash flows or earnings to changes in commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates. We may use financial- and commodity-based derivative contracts to manage the risks produced by changes in the prices of crude oil and related products, natural gas and electric power; fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates; or to capture market opportunities.Our use of derivative instruments is governed by an “Authority Limitations” document approved by our Board of Directors that prohibits the use of highly leveraged derivatives or derivative instruments without sufficient market liquidity for comparable valuations. The Authority Limitations document also establishes the Value at Risk (VaR) limits for us, and compliance with these limits is monitored daily. Our Chief Financial Officer monitors risks resulting from foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. Our Executive Vice President over the Commercial organization monitors commodity price risk. The Commercial organization manages our commercial marketing, optimizes our commodity flows and positions, and monitors related risks of our businesses.Commodity Price RiskWe sell into or receive supply from the worldwide crude oil, refined products, natural gas, NGL, and electric power markets and are exposed to fluctuations in the prices for these commodities.These fluctuations can affect our revenues and purchases, as well as the cost of operating, investing and financing activities. Generally, our policy is to remain exposed to the market prices of commodities.Our Commercial organization uses futures, forwards, swaps and options in various markets to optimize the value of our supply chain, which may move our risk profile away from market average prices to accomplish the following objectives: •Balance physical systems. In addition to cash settlement prior to contract expiration, exchange-traded futures contracts also may be settled by physical delivery of the commodity, providing another source of supply to meet our refinery requirements or marketing demand.•Meet customer needs. Consistent with our policy to generally remain exposed to market prices, we use swap contracts to convert fixed-price sales contracts, which are often requested by refined product consumers, to a floating-market price.•Manage the risk to our cash flows from price exposures on specific crude oil, refined product, natural gas, and electric power transactions.•Enable us to use the market knowledge gained from these activities to capture market opportunities such as moving physical commodities to more profitable locations, storing commodities to capture seasonal or time premiums, and blending commodities to capture quality upgrades. Derivatives may be utilized to optimize these activities.We use a VaR model to estimate the loss in fair value that could potentially result on a single day from the effect of adverse changes in market conditions on the derivative financial instruments and derivative commodity instruments held or issued, including commodity purchase and sales contracts recorded on the balance sheet at December 31, 2012, as derivative instruments. Using Monte Carlo simulation, a 95 percent confidence level and a one-day holding period, the VaR for those instruments issued or held for trading purposes at December 31, 2012 and 2011, was immaterial to our cash flows and net income.The VaR for instruments held for purposes other than trading at December 31, 2012 and 2011, was also immaterial to our cash flows and net income.Interest Rate RiskThe following table provides information about our debt instruments that are sensitive to changes in U.S. interest rates. The table presents principal cash flows and related weighted-average interest rates by expected maturity dates. Weighted-average variable rates are based on effective rates at the reporting date. The carrying amount of our floating-rate debt approximates its fair value. The fair value of the fixed-rate financial instruments is estimated based on quoted market prices.50Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements Millions of Dollars Except as Indicated Expected Maturity Date Fixed Rate Maturity Average Interest Rate Floating Rate Maturity Average Interest Rate Year-End 2012 2013 $12 7.00% $— —% 2014 14 7.00 286 1.47 2015 814 2.04 714 1.47 2016 15 7.00 — — 2017 1,516 2.99 — — Remaining years 3,552 5.00 50 0.24 Total $5,923 $1,050 Fair value $6,507 $1,050 For additional information about our use of derivative instruments, see Note 16—Derivatives and Financial Instruments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.51Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsCAUTIONARY STATEMENT FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE “SAFE HARBOR” PROVISIONS OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995This report includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

Readers are cautioned that such forward-looking statements should be read in conjunction with the company’s disclosures under the heading: “CAUTIONARY STATEMENT FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE ‘SAFE HARBOR’ PROVISIONS OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995,” beginning on page 59.The terms “earnings” and “loss” as used in Management’s Discussion and Analysis refer to net income (loss) attributable to Phillips 66.BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND EXECUTIVE OVERVIEWPhillips 66 is an energy manufacturing and logistics company with midstream, chemicals, refining, and marketing and specialties businesses. At December 31, 2013, we had total assets of $49.8 billion.The SeparationOn April 4, 2012, the ConocoPhillips Board of Directors approved the separation of its downstream businesses into an independent, publicly traded company named Phillips 66. In accordance with the Separation and Distribution Agreement, the two companies were separated by ConocoPhillips distributing to its stockholders all 625,272,302 shares of common stock of Phillips 66 after the market closed on April 30, 2012 (the Separation). Each ConocoPhillips stockholder received one share of Phillips 66 stock for every two shares of ConocoPhillips stock. Following the Separation, ConocoPhillips retained no ownership interest in Phillips 66, and each company has separate public ownership, boards of directors and management. Basis of PresentationSee Note 1—Separation and Basis of Presentation, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for information on the basis of presentation of our financial information that affects the comparability of financial information for periods before and after the Separation.Effective January 1, 2013, we changed the organizational structure of the internal financial information reviewed by our chief executive officer, and determined this resulted in a change in the composition of our operating segments. The primary effects of this reporting organization were:•We disaggregated the former Refining and Marketing (R&M) segment into two separate operating segments titled ""Refining"" and ""Marketing and Specialties."" •We moved our Transportation and power businesses from the former R&M segment to the Midstream and Marketing and Specialties (M&S) segments, respectively.The segment alignment is presented for the year ended December 31, 2013, with the prior periods recast for comparability. Certain prior period amounts have also been recast to reflect Phillips Specialty Products Inc. (PSPI) as discontinued operations due to its planned disposition.29Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsExecutive OverviewWe reported earnings of $3.7 billion in 2013, generated $6.0 billion in cash from operating activities, and received $1.2 billion from asset dispositions. We used available cash to fund capital expenditures and investments of $1.8 billion, pay dividends of $0.8 billion, repurchase $2.2 billion of our common stock and repay $1.0 billion of debt. We ended 2013 with $5.4 billion of cash and cash equivalents and approximately $5.4 billion of total capacity under our available liquidity facilities. In July 2013, Phillips 66 Partners LP, a master limited partnership we formed, completed its initial public offering of 18,888,750 common units, raising net proceeds of $404 million. Its assets consist of crude oil and refined petroleum product pipeline, terminal and storage systems in the Central and Gulf Coast regions of the United States, each of which is integral to a Phillips 66-operated refinery to which it is connected.We continue to focus on the following strategic priorities:•Maintain strong operating excellence. Safety and reliability are our first priority, and we are committed to protecting the health and safety of everyone who has a role in our operations and the communities in which we operate. We are committed to protecting the environment and strive to reduce our environmental footprint throughout our operations. Optimizing utilization rates at our refineries through reliable and safe operations enables us to capture the value available in the market in terms of prices and margins. During 2013, our worldwide refining crude oil capacity utilization rate was 93 percent, the same as in 2012. •Deliver profitable growth and enhance returns. We have budgeted $2.7 billion in capital expenditures and investments in 2014, approximately 40 percent higher than our 2013 budget. Including our share of expected capital spending by joint ventures DCP Midstream, LLC (DCP Midstream), Chevron Phillips Chemical Company (CPChem) and WRB Refining LP (WRB), our total 2014 capital program is expected to be $4.6 billion. This program is designed primarily to grow our Midstream and Chemicals segments, which have planned expansions for manufacturing and logistics capacity. The need for additional new gathering and processing, pipeline, storage and distribution infrastructure–driven by growing domestic unconventional crude oil, natural gas liquids (NGL) and natural gas production–is creating capital investment opportunities in our Midstream business. Over the next few years, our Chemicals joint venture, CPChem, plans significant reinvestment of its earnings to build additional processing capacity benefiting from lower-cost NGL feedstocks. We plan to improve refining returns through greater use of advantaged feedstocks, disciplined capital allocation and portfolio optimization. We continue to focus on funding the most attractive growth opportunities across our portfolio.•Grow shareholder distributions. We believe shareholder value is enhanced through, among other things, consistent and ongoing growth of regular dividends, supplemented by share repurchases. We increased our dividend rate by 56 percent during 2013, and it has been almost doubled since the Separation. Regular dividends demonstrate the confidence our management has in our capital structure and its capability to generate free cash flow throughout the business cycle. As of December 31, 2013, we repurchased $2.6 billion, or approximately 44.1 million shares, of our common stock. At the discretion of our Board of Directors, we plan to increase dividends annually and fund our share repurchase program while continuing to invest in the growth of our business.•Build a high-performing organization. We strive to attract, train, develop and retain individuals with the knowledge and skills to implement our business strategy and who support our values and ethics. Throughout the company, we focus on getting results in the right way and believe success is both what we do and how we do it. We encourage collaboration throughout our company, while valuing differences, respecting diversity of thought, and creating a great place to work. We foster an environment of learning and development through structured programs focused on building functional and technical skills where employees are engaged in our business and committed to their own success, as well as to the company's success. 30Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsBusiness EnvironmentThe Midstream segment includes our 50 percent equity investment in DCP Midstream. Earnings of DCP Midstream are closely linked to NGL prices, natural gas prices and, to a lesser extent, crude oil prices. Industry NGL annual average prices decreased from 2011 to 2012 and again from 2012 to 2013, due to relatively higher inventories driven by growing NGL production from liquids-rich shale plays with limited corresponding demand increase from the petrochemical industry and constrained export capacity. Natural gas prices decreased from 2011 to 2012, but increased from 2012 to 2013. The decrease in natural gas prices in 2012 was largely due to higher supply levels and relatively lower demand. The increase in 2013 was primarily driven by relatively colder weather in the first half of the year, which lowered inventory stock levels to below the five-year average low, as well as pipeline constraints in the Northeast United States. The Chemicals segment consists of our 50 percent equity investment in CPChem. The chemicals and plastics industry is mainly a commodity-based industry where the margins for key products are based on market factors. The chemicals and plastics industry continues to experience higher ethylene margins in regions of the world where production is based upon NGL versus crude-derived feedstocks. In particular, North American ethane-based crackers benefited from the lower-priced feedstocks and improved ethylene margins. This margin strength was sustained through the ethylene chain, including polyethylene.Results for our Refining segment depend largely on refining margins, cost control, refinery throughput, and product yields. The crack spread is a measure of the difference between market prices for refined petroleum products and crude oil, and it is used within our industry as an indicator for refining margins. The U.S. 3:2:1 crack spread (three barrels of crude oil producing two barrels of gasoline and one barrel of diesel) increased from 2011 to 2012, but decreased from 2012 to 2013. The 2012 domestic industry average crack spread improved over 2011 primarily as a result of improved global demand for refined products resulting from worldwide economic recovery, along with limited net increase in global refining capacity. U.S. margins in the Midcontinent were especially strong, which was attributed to the region's crude feedstock advantage during this period. The decrease in the domestic industry average crack spread from 2012 to 2013 was largely due to the larger decline in gasoline and distillates prices compared to crude prices during 2013, as a result of expansion in refining capacity. U.S. crude production continues to increase and nationwide growth is benefiting from slower decline rates in legacy production areas. Limited infrastructure for takeaway options resulted in favorable feedstock prices for U.S. refiners with access to advantaged crudes. Midcontinent refiners were especially advantaged. Sustained pressure on inventories in the Midcontinent caused West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude to continue trading at a discount relative to crudes such as Light Louisiana Sweet (LLS) and Brent during 2013. Refineries capable of processing WTI crude and crude oils that price relative to WTI, primarily the Midcontinent and Gulf Coast refineries, benefited from these lower regional feedstock prices. The spread between WTI and Brent over the year narrowed considerably, stemming from increased pipeline outlets from Cushing to the Gulf Coast, as well as tightening Canadian light crude supply in the Midcontinent region.The Northwest Europe benchmark crack spread increased from 2011 to 2012, but decreased from 2012 to 2013. The improved benchmark crack spread in Northwest Europe for 2012, compared with 2011, resulted from improved global demand for refined products with worldwide economic recovery. The decline from 2012 to 2013 was due to lower European domestic and export product demand on weak refinery economics while large volumes of imported diesel from the United States, India, Asia Pacific and Russia kept prices under pressure. Weak domestic European demand and reduced export markets for gasoline compounded the declining product crack spreads. Results for our M&S segment depend largely on marketing fuel margins, lubricant margins and other specialty product margins. These margins are primarily based on market factors, largely determined by the relationship between demand and supply. Marketing fuel margins are primarily determined by the trend of the spot prices for refined products. Generally, a downward trend of spot prices has a favorable impact on the marketing fuel margins, while an upward trend of spot prices has an unfavorable impact on marketing fuel margins. 31Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsRESULTS OF OPERATIONSConsolidated ResultsA summary of the company’s earnings by business segment follows: Millions of Dollars Year Ended December 31 2013 2012 2011 Midstream$469 53 2,149Chemicals986 823 716Refining1,851 3,217 1,529Marketing and Specialties790 417 530Corporate and Other(431) (434) (192)Discontinued Operations61 48 43Net income attributable to Phillips 66$3,726 4,124 4,7752013 vs. 2012 Our earnings decreased $398 million, or 10 percent, in 2013, primarily resulting from lower realized refining margins as a result of decreased market crack spreads and impacts related to lower feedstock advantage. This decrease was partially offset by:•Lower impairment expense in 2013. We recorded impairments related to our equity investments in Malaysian Refining Company Sdn. Bdh. (MRC), a refining company in Melaka, Malaysia, and Rockies Express Pipeline LLC (REX), a natural gas transmission system, in 2012.•Improved worldwide marketing margins.•Lower interest and costs resulting from CPChem's early debt retirements in 2012.2012 vs. 2011 Our earnings decreased $651 million, or 14 percent, in 2012, primarily resulting from:•A $1,437 million after-tax decrease in net gains on asset dispositions in 2012. 2011 results included significant gains on the disposition of three pipeline systems.•A $648 million after-tax increase in impairments in 2012, primarily reflecting impairments of our equity investments in MRC and REX.•A $137 million after-tax increase in net interest expense, reflecting the issuance of $7.8 billion of debt during the first-half of 2012 in connection with the Separation.•Lower NGL prices during 2012, which contributed to decreased earnings from our Midstream segment.These items were partially offset by:•Improved margins in the Refining segment.•Improved ethylene and polyethylene margins in the Chemicals segment. See the ""Segment Results"" section for additional information on our segment results.32Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsIncome Statement Analysis2013 vs. 2012 Sales and other operating revenues and purchased crude oil and products both decreased 4 percent in 2013. The decreases were primarily due to lower average prices for crude oil and petroleum products.Equity in earnings of affiliates decreased 2 percent in 2013, primarily resulting from decreased earnings from WRB, partially offset by increased equity earnings from CPChem. •Equity in earnings of WRB decreased 21 percent, mainly due to lower refining margins in the Central Corridor as a result of lower market crack spreads. •Equity in earnings of CPChem increased 14 percent, primarily driven by the absence of costs and interest associated with CPChem's early retirement of debt in 2012, improved realized margins, higher equity earnings from CPChem's equity affiliates and the absence of 2012 fixed asset impairments. These increases were partially offset by lower olefins and polyolefins sales volumes related to ethylene outages. In addition, increased turnaround and maintenance activity resulted in lower volumes and higher costs.Net gain on dispositions decreased 72 percent in 2013, primarily resulting from a net gain associated with the sale of the Trainer Refinery and associated terminal and pipeline assets in 2012, compared with a gain resulting from the sale of our E-GasTM Technology business in May 2013. For additional information, see Note 5—Assets Held for Sale or Sold, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 13 percent in 2013, primarily due to costs associated with the Separation and costs relating to a prior retail disposition program in 2012.Impairments in 2013 were $29 million, compared with $1,158 million in 2012. Impairments in 2012 included our investments in MRC and REX, a marine terminal and associated assets, and equipment formerly associated with the canceled Wilhelmshaven Refinery (WRG) upgrade project. For additional information, see Note 9—Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. See Note 20—Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for information regarding our provision for income taxes and effective tax rates.2012 vs. 2011 Sales and other operating revenues decreased 8 percent in 2012, while purchased crude oil and products decreased 11 percent. The decreases were mainly due to processing lower refining volumes at our wholly owned refineries, resulting from the shutdown of Trainer Refinery in September 2011, combined with lower crude oil and NGL prices. Equity in earnings of affiliates increased 10 percent in 2012, primarily resulting from improved earnings from WRB and CPChem. Equity in earnings of WRB increased 43 percent, mainly due to higher refining margins in the Central Corridor, combined with processing higher volumes associated with the coker and refining expansion (CORE) project at the Wood River Refinery. Equity in earnings of CPChem increased 22 percent, primarily resulting from higher ethylene and polyethylene margins. These improvements were partially offset by:•Lower earnings from DCP Midstream, mainly due to a decrease in NGL prices.•Lower earnings from Excel Paralubes, Merey Sweeny, L.P. (MSLP) and MRC, mainly due to lower margins.•The absence of earnings from Colonial Pipeline Company, which was sold in December 2011.Net gain on dispositions decreased 88 percent in 2012, primarily resulting from 2011 gains associated with the disposition of three pipeline systems, compared with a net gain associated with the sale of Trainer Refinery and 33Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statementsassociated terminal and pipeline assets in the second quarter of 2012. For additional information, see Note 5—Assets Held for Sale or Sold, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Other income increased $90 million in 2012, primarily associated with a keep-whole payment received from a third party associated with the sale of its ownership interest in REX, gains from trading activities not directly related to our physical business, and income received from ConocoPhillips associated with shared services. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 22 percent in 2012, primarily resulting from one-time and incremental costs associated with the Separation, as well as incremental costs relating to a prior retail disposition program.Impairments in 2012 included our investments in MRC and REX, a marine terminal and associated assets, and equipment formerly associated with the canceled WRG upgrade project. Impairments in 2011 included the Trainer Refinery and associated terminal and pipeline assets. For additional information, see Note 9—Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Interest and debt expense increased $229 million in 2012, primarily due to approximately $7.8 billion of new debt issued in early 2012.

The natural gas is then processed to extract NGL from the raw gas stream. The remaining ""residue"" gas is marketed to electric utilities, industrial users and gas marketing companies. Most of the NGLs are fractionated—separated into individual components such as ethane, propane and butane—and marketed as chemical feedstock, fuel or blendstock. In addition, the Midstream segment includes U.S. transportation and terminaling services associated with the movement of crude oil, refined and specialty products, natural gas and NGL. The Midstream segment includes our 50 percent equity investment in DCP Midstream, as well as NGL fractionation, trading and marketing businesses in the United States. 2013 vs. 2012 Earnings from the Midstream segment increased $416 million in 2013, compared with 2012. The improvement was primarily driven by higher earnings from our Transportation business and DCP Midstream, partially offset by lower earnings from NGL Operations and Other. Transportation earnings increased $410 million in 2013, compared with 2012. These increases primarily resulted from lower impairments in 2013, as well as increased throughput fees. In 2012, we recorded after-tax impairments totaling $303 million on our equity investment in REX, primarily reflecting a diminished view of fair value of west-to-east natural gas transmission, due to the impact of shale gas production in the northeast. For additional information on the REX impairment, see Note 9—Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Throughput fees were 35Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statementshigher in 2013, primarily due to the implementation of market-based intersegment transfer prices for transportation and terminaling services during 2013.The $31 million increase in earnings of DCP Midstream in 2013 primarily resulted from an increase in gains associated with unit issuances by DCP Midstream Partners, LP (DCP Partners), as described below. In addition, higher natural gas and crude oil prices benefitted earnings. These increases were partially offset by lower NGL prices and higher interest expense. See the “Business Environment and Executive Overview” section for additional information on NGL prices.DCP Partners, a subsidiary of DCP Midstream, issues, from time to time, limited partner units to the public. These issuances benefited our equity in earnings from DCP Midstream, on an after-tax basis, by approximately $62 million in 2013, compared with approximately $24 million in 2012.NGL Operations and Other decreased $25 million, or 30 percent, in 2013, compared with 2012. The decrease was primarily due to inventory impacts, reflecting inventory reductions in 2012 in anticipation of the Separation, which caused liquidations of LIFO inventory values. 2012 vs. 2011 Earnings from the Midstream segment decreased $2,096 million in 2012, compared with 2011. The decrease was primarily due to lower net gains on disposition of assets and higher impairments in our Transportation business, as well as decreased equity earnings from DCP Midstream. These items were partially offset by a keep-whole payment received from a third party associated with the sale of its ownership in REX. Transportation earnings decreased $1,989 million in 2012, compared with 2011. During 2011, Transportation included an after-tax gain of $1,595 million on the sales of Seaway Products Pipeline Company, and our ownership interest in Colonial Pipeline Company and Seaway Crude Pipeline Company. For additional information, see Note 5—Assets Held for Sale or Sold, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Additionally, in 2012, we recorded after-tax impairments totaling $303 million on our equity investment in REX. A $108 million decrease in earnings of DCP Midstream in 2012 mainly resulted from lower NGL prices and, to a lesser extent, lower natural gas prices, partially offset by lower depreciation, favorable volume impacts due to greater NGL extracted from liquid rich areas (such as Permian Basin, Eagle Ford Shale and Denver-Julesburg Basin), and increased gains from the issuance of limited partner units by DCP Partners. Issuances of limited partner units by DCP Partners benefited our equity earnings from DCP Midstream by approximately $24 million after tax in 2012, compared with approximately $11 million after tax in 2011. During the second quarter of 2012, DCP Midstream completed a review of the estimated depreciable lives of its major classes of properties, plants and equipment. As a result of that review, the depreciable lives were extended. This change in accounting estimate was implemented on a prospective basis, effective April 1, 2012. 36Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsChemicals Year Ended December 31 2013 2012 2011 Millions of Dollars Net Income Attributable to Phillips 66$986 823 716 Millions of PoundsCPChem Externally Marketed Sales Volumes* Olefins and polyolefins16,071 14,967 14,305Specialties, aromatics and styrenics6,230 6,719 6,704 22,301 21,686 21,009*Represents 100 percent of CPChem's outside sales of produced petrochemical products, as well as commission sales from equity affiliates. Olefins and Polyolefins Capacity Utilization (percent)88% 93 94The Chemicals segment consists of our 50 percent interest in CPChem, which we account for under the equity method. CPChem uses NGL and other feedstocks to produce petrochemicals. These products are then marketed and sold or used as feedstocks to produce plastics and other chemicals.2013 vs. 2012 CPChem continued to benefit from price-advantaged NGL feedstocks in 2013 due to the location of its manufacturing facilities in the U.S. Gulf Coast and Middle East. Earnings from the Chemicals segment increased $163 million, or 20 percent, in 2013, compared with 2012. The increase in earnings was primarily driven by:•Lower costs and interest associated with CPChem's 2012 early retirement of $1 billion of debt.•Improved polyethylene realized margins.•Higher equity earnings from CPChem's equity affiliates, reflecting increased volumes and margins.•Lower asset impairments. These increases were partially offset by lower olefins and polyolefins sales volumes related to ethylene outages. In addition, increased turnaround and maintenance activity resulted in lower volumes and higher costs. See the ""Business Environment and Executive Overview"" section for information on market factors impacting CPChem's results.2012 vs. 2011Earnings from the Chemicals segment increased $107 million, or 15 percent, in 2012, compared with 2011. The increase was primarily driven by higher ethylene and polyethylene margins and lower utility costs, partially offset by a loss on early extinguishment of debt and asset impairments. Ethylene margins benefited from lower feedstock costs, particularly lower ethane and propane prices during 2012. Utility costs benefited from lower natural gas prices during 2012.During 2012, CPChem retired $1 billion of fixed-rate debt. CPChem also incurred prepayment premiums and wrote off the associated unamortized debt issuance costs. As a result, CPChem recognized a loss on early extinguishment of debt in 2012 of $287 million (100 percent basis), which decreased our equity in earnings from CPChem, on an after-tax basis, by approximately $90 million. In addition, during 2012, CPChem recorded asset impairments totaling $91 million (100 percent basis), which decreased our equity in earnings from CPChem, on an after-tax basis, by $28 million. These asset impairments primarily included certain specialties, aromatics and styrenics asset groups and were mainly driven by decreases in cash flow projections. 37Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsRefining Year Ended December 31 2013 2012 2011 Millions of DollarsNet Income (Loss) Attributable to Phillips 66 Atlantic Basin/Europe$42 565 (330)Gulf Coast130 579 466Central Corridor1,484 2,263 1,439Western/Pacific45 (385) 29Other refining150 195 (75)Worldwide$1,851 3,217 1,529 Dollars Per BarrelRefining Margins Atlantic Basin/Europe$6.87 9.28 5.93Gulf Coast6.63 9.02 8.01Central Corridor18.62 26.37 19.87Western/Pacific8.20 11.04 9.13Worldwide10.10 13.59 9.79 Thousands of Barrels DailyOperating Statistics Refining operations* Atlantic Basin/Europe Crude oil capacity588 588 726Crude oil processed546 555 682Capacity utilization (percent)93% 94 94Refinery production578 599 736Gulf Coast Crude oil capacity733 733 733Crude oil processed651 657 658Capacity utilization (percent)89% 90 90Refinery production736 743 748Central Corridor Crude oil capacity477 470 471Crude oil processed472 454 433Capacity utilization (percent)99% 97 92Refinery production489 471 448Western/Pacific Crude oil capacity440 439 435Crude oil processed410 398 393Capacity utilization (percent)93% 91 91Refinery production445 419 419Worldwide Crude oil capacity2,238 2,230 2,365Crude oil processed2,079 2,064 2,166Capacity utilization (percent)93% 93 92Refinery production2,248 2,232 2,351*Includes our share of equity affiliates. 38Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsThe Refining segment buys, sells and refines crude oil and other feedstocks into petroleum products (such as gasoline, distillates and aviation fuels) at 15 refineries, mainly in the United States, Europe and Asia.2013 vs. 2012 Earnings for the Refining segment were $1,851 million in 2013, a decrease of $1,366 million, or 42 percent, compared with 2012. The decrease in earnings in 2013 was primarily due to lower realized refining margins as a result of a 16 percent reduction in market cracks and impacts related to lower feedstock advantage. In addition to margins, refining results were also impacted by a $104 million after-tax gain from the sale of the Trainer Refinery and associated terminal and pipeline assets in 2012. These decreases were partially offset by reduced impairments recorded in 2012, primarily related to MRC and WRG. See the “Business Environment and Executive Overview” section for information on industry crack spreads and other market factors impacting this year’s results.Our worldwide refining crude oil capacity utilization rate was 93 percent in both 2013 and 2012, as the lack of weather disruptions were offset by higher turnaround activities. 2012 vs. 2011 Refining reported earnings of $3,217 million in 2012, an increase of $1,688 million, or 110 percent, compared with 2011. The increase in earnings in 2012 was primarily due to improved worldwide refining margins driven by improved market conditions and optimizing access to lower-cost crude oil feedstocks, as well as a net gain on disposition of the Trainer Refinery and associated terminal and pipeline assets. These were partially offset by higher impairments and increased maintenance and repair expense associated with our Bayway Refinery as a result of severe weather disruptions. During 2012, Refining included an after-tax gain of $104 million from the sale of the Trainer Refinery and associated terminal and pipeline assets. For additional information, see Note 5—Assets Held for Sale or Sold, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Additionally, during 2012, Refining results included an after-tax impairment of $564 million on our equity investment in MRC and an after-tax impairment of $42 million related to equipment formerly associated with the canceled WRG upgrade project, compared with an after-tax impairment of $303 million on the Trainer Refinery during 2011. Our worldwide refining capacity utilization rate was 93 percent in 2012, compared with 92 percent in 2011. The improvement was primarily due to improved market conditions, partially offset by higher turnaround and maintenance activities, as well as severe weather disruptions.39Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsMarketing and Specialties Year Ended December 31 2013 2012 2011 Millions of DollarsNet Income Attributable to Phillips 66 Marketing and Other$673 263 401Specialties117 154 129Total Marketing and Specialties$790 417 530 Dollars Per BarrelRealized Marketing Fuel Margin* U.S.$1.21 0.87 0.74International4.36 4.17 4.26*On third-party petroleum products sales.

In addition, this segment includes the manufacturing and marketing of specialty products (such as lubricants), as well as power generation operations. 2013 vs. 2012 Earnings from the M&S segment increased $373 million, or 89 percent, in 2013, compared with 2012. See the ""Business Environment and Executive Overview"" section for information on marketing fuel margins and other market factors impacting this year's results.During 2013, U.S. marketing margins benefited from higher Renewable Identification Numbers (RINs) values associated with renewable fuels blending activities, particularly during the first three quarters. RIN prices decreased during the fourth quarter, as concerns over their availability eased somewhat based on anticipated actions by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. As a result, we would expect the benefit to our U.S. marketing margins from RINs to be lower in 2014 than we experienced in 2013. The increased RIN prices offset weaker underlying components of our U.S. marketing margins during 2013. M&S earnings benefited from higher international marketing margins in 2013, as well as an after-tax gain of $23 million from the sale of our E-GasTM Technology business in May 2013. Earnings in 2012 were lowered by income taxes associated with foreign dividends, and 2012 included a full year of earnings from our U.K. power generation business, which was sold in July 2013.40Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements2012 vs. 2011Earnings from the M&S segment decreased $113 million, or 21 percent, in 2012, compared with 2011. During 2012, the segment was negatively impacted by higher income taxes associated with foreign dividends, increased costs, and lower volumes, partially offset by higher U.S. margins. In addition, 2011 earnings benefited from an after-tax gain of $26 million from the sale of our delayed coker licensing business.Corporate and Other Millions of Dollars Year Ended December 31 2013 2012 2011Net Loss Attributable to Phillips 66 Net interest expense$(166) (148) (11)Corporate general and administrative expenses(145) (116) (76)Technology(50) (49) (53)Repositioning costs— (55) —Other(70) (66) (52)Total Corporate and Other$(431) (434) (192)2013 vs. 2012Net interest expense consists of interest and financing expense, net of interest income and capitalized interest. Net interest expense increased $18 million in 2013, compared with 2012, primarily due to increased average debt outstanding in 2013, reflecting the issuance of debt in early 2012 in connection with the Separation. For additional information, see Note 12—Debt, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Corporate general and administrative expenses increased $29 million in 2013, compared with 2012. The increase was primarily due to incremental costs and expenses associated with operating as a stand-alone company. Repositioning costs decreased $55 million in 2013, compared with 2012. 2012 vs. 2011Net interest expense increased $137 million in 2012, compared with 2011, primarily due to approximately $7.8 billion of new debt issued in early 2012. For additional information, see Note 12—Debt, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Corporate general and administrative expenses increased $40 million in 2012, compared with 2011. The increase was primarily due to incremental costs and expenses associated with operating as a stand-alone company for the eight months subsequent to the Separation.Repositioning costs consist of expenses related to the Separation. Expenses incurred in the eight-month period subsequent to the Separation primarily included compensation and benefits, employee relocations and moves, information systems, and shared services costs.The ""Other"" category includes certain income tax expenses, environmental costs associated with sites no longer in operation, foreign currency transaction gains and losses and other costs not directly associated with an operating segment. Changes in the ""Other"" category were mainly due to an after-tax impairment of $16 million on a corporate property in 2012.41Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsDiscontinued Operations Millions of Dollars Year Ended December 31 2013 2012 2011Net Income Attributable to Phillips 66 Discontinued operations$61 48 43On December 30, 2013, we entered into an agreement to exchange PSPI for shares of our common stock held by the other party, with closing expected in the first quarter of 2014.

To meet our short- and long-term liquidity requirements, we look to a variety of funding sources, but rely primarily on cash generated from operating activities. During 2013, we generated $6.0 billion in cash from operations, received $1.2 billion from asset dispositions and received $0.4 billion as a result of net proceeds received from the issuance of Phillips 66 Partners' common units. This available cash was primarily used for capital expenditures and investments ($1.8 billion), repurchases of our common stock ($2.2 billion), debt repayments ($1.0 billion) and dividend payments on our common stock ($0.8 billion). During 2013, cash and cash equivalents increased by $1.9 billion to $5.4 billion, of which $425 million was held by Phillips 66 Partners.In addition to cash flows from operating activities, we rely on our credit facility programs, asset sales and our shelf registration statement to support our short- and long-term liquidity requirements. We believe current cash and cash equivalents and cash generated by operations, together with access to external sources of funds as described below under “Significant Sources of Capital,” will be sufficient to meet our funding requirements in the near and long term, including our capital spending, dividend payments, defined benefit plan contributions, repayment of debt and share repurchases. Significant Sources of CapitalOperating ActivitiesDuring 2013, cash of $6,027 million was provided by operating activities, a 40 percent increase from cash from operations of $4,296 million in 2012. The increase in the 2013 period primarily reflected positive working capital impacts. Accounts payable activity increased cash from operations by $360 million in 2013, reflecting both higher volumes and commodity prices. By comparison, lower commodity prices and volumes reduced cash from operations by $985 million in 2012. Our distributions from CPChem increased over $500 million in 2013, compared with 2012, reflecting the completion of CPChem’s debt repayments in 2012, which allowed increased dividends to us and our co-venturer. Partially offsetting the positive impact of working capital changes in 2013 were lower refining margins during 2013, reflecting less favorable market conditions and tightening crude differentials.During 2012, cash of $4,296 million was provided by operating activities, a 14 percent decrease from cash from operations of $5,006 million in 2011. The decrease primarily reflected the impact of working capital changes. Accounts payable activity lowered cash from operations by $985 million in 2012, primarily reflecting lower commodity prices and volumes. Inventory management had a reduced benefit to working capital in 2012, compared with 2011. Partially offsetting the negative impact of working capital changes were improved U.S. refining margins during 2012, reflecting improved market conditions and increasing access to lower-cost crude oil feedstocks. Increased distributions from equity affiliates, particularly WRB, whose refineries are located in the Central Corridor region, also partially offset the negative impact of working capital changes in 2012.Our short- and long-term operating cash flows are highly dependent upon refining and marketing margins, NGL prices, and chemicals margins. Prices and margins in our industry are typically volatile, and are driven by market conditions 43Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statementsover which we have little or no control. Absent other mitigating factors, as these prices and margins fluctuate, we would expect a corresponding change in our operating cash flows.The level and quality of output from our refineries also impacts our cash flows. The output at our refineries is impacted by such factors as operating efficiency, maintenance turnarounds, market conditions, feedstock availability and weather conditions. We actively manage the operations of our refineries and, typically, any variability in their operations has not been as significant to cash flows as that caused by margins and prices. Our worldwide refining crude oil capacity utilization was 93 percent in both 2013 and 2012. We are forecasting 2014 utilization to remain in the low 90-percent range. Our operating cash flows are also impacted by distribution decisions made by our equity affiliates, including DCP Midstream, CPChem and WRB. Over the three years ended December 31, 2013, we received distributions of $812 million from DCP Midstream, $1,893 million from CPChem and $3,302 million from WRB. We cannot control the amount of future distributions from equity affiliates; therefore, future distributions by these and other equity affiliates are not assured.Asset SalesProceeds from asset sales in 2013 were $1,214 million, compared with $286 million in 2012 and $2,627 million in 2011. The 2013 proceeds included the sale of a power plant in the United Kingdom, as well as our gasification technology. The 2012 proceeds included the sale of a refinery and associated terminal and pipeline assets located in Trainer, Pennsylvania, as well as the sale of our Riverhead Terminal located in Riverhead, New York. The 2011 proceeds included the sale of our ownership interests in Colonial Pipeline Company and Seaway Crude Pipeline Company, as well as the Wilhelmshaven Refinery and Seaway Products Pipeline Company. As of December 31, 2013, a before-tax gain of $375 million associated with 2013 asset sales was deferred due to an indemnity provided to the buyer. A portion of the deferred gain is denominated in a foreign currency; accordingly, the amount of the deferred gain translated into U.S. dollars is subject to change based on currency fluctuations. Absent claims under the indemnity, the deferred gain will be recognized into earnings as our exposure under this indemnity declines, currently expected to begin in the second half of 2014 and end in the first half of 2015.Initial Public Offering of Phillips 66 Partners LPIn 2013, we formed Phillips 66 Partners, a master limited partnership, to own, operate, develop and acquire primarily fee-based crude oil, refined petroleum product and NGL pipelines and terminals, as well as other transportation and midstream assets. On July 26, 2013, Phillips 66 Partners completed its initial public offering of 18,888,750 common units at a price of $23.00 per unit, which included a 2,463,750 common unit over-allotment option that was fully exercised by the underwriters. Phillips 66 Partners received $404 million in net proceeds from the sale of the units, after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions, structuring fees and offering expenses. Headquartered in Houston, Texas, Phillips 66 Partners' assets consist of crude oil and refined petroleum product pipeline, terminal, and storage systems in the Central and Gulf Coast regions of the United States, each of which is integral to a connected Phillips 66-operated refinery.We currently own a 71.7 percent limited partner interest and a 2.0 percent general partner interest in Phillips 66 Partners, while the public owns a 26.3 percent limited partner interest. We consolidate Phillips 66 Partners as a variable interest entity for financial reporting purposes (for additional information, see Note 3—Variable Interest Entities (VIEs), in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). The public's ownership interest in Phillips 66 Partners is reflected as a noncontrolling interest in our financial statements, including $409 million in the equity section of our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2013. Phillips 66 Partners' cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2013, were $425 million.Credit FacilitiesDuring the second quarter of 2013, we amended our revolving credit agreement by entering into the First Amendment to Credit Agreement (Amendment). The Amendment increased the borrowing capacity from $4.0 billion to $4.5 billion, extended the term from February 2017 to June 2018, reduced the margin applied to interest and fees accruing on and after the Amendment effective date, and made certain amendments with respect to Phillips 66 Partners. As of December 31, 2013, no amount had been drawn under this facility; however, $51 million in letters of credit had been issued that were supported by this facility.44Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsThe revolving credit agreement contains covenants that we consider usual and customary for an agreement of this type for comparable commercial borrowers, including a maximum consolidated net debt-to-capitalization ratio of 60 percent. The agreement has customary events of default, such as nonpayment of principal when due; nonpayment of interest, fees or other amounts; violation of covenants; cross-payment default and cross-acceleration (in each case, to indebtedness in excess of a threshold amount); and a change of control.Borrowings under the credit agreement will incur interest at the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a margin based on the credit rating of our senior unsecured long-term debt as determined from time to time by Standard & Poor's Ratings Services (S&P) and Moody's Investors Service (Moody's). The revolving credit agreement also provides for customary fees, including administrative agent fees and commitment fees. On June 7, 2013, Phillips 66 Partners entered into a senior unsecured $250 million revolving credit agreement (Revolver) with a syndicate of financial institutions, which became effective upon its initial public offering of common units on July 26, 2013. Phillips 66 Partners has the option to increase the overall capacity of the Revolver by up to an additional $250 million, subject to certain conditions. The Revolver has an initial term of five years. As of December 31, 2013, no amount had been drawn under this facility.Trade Receivables Securitization FacilityOur trade receivables securitization facility, which was entered into during April 2012, has a term of three years. During the second quarter of 2013, we amended the facility by entering into the First Amendment to Receivables Purchase Agreement (Securitization Amendment). The Securitization Amendment decreased the borrowing capacity from $1.2 billion to $696 million and made certain amendments with respect to Phillips 66 Partners. As of December 31, 2013, no amount had been drawn under this facility. However, $26 million in letters of credit had been issued that were collateralized by trade receivables held by a subsidiary under this facility.Debt FinancingsOur $5.8 billion of Senior Notes were issued by Phillips 66, and are guaranteed by Phillips 66 Company, a 100-percent-owned subsidiary. Our senior unsecured long-term debt has been rated investment grade by S&P and Moody's. We do not have any ratings triggers on any of our corporate debt that would cause an automatic default, and thereby impact our access to liquidity, in the event of a downgrade of our credit rating. If our credit rating deteriorated to a level prohibiting us from accessing the commercial paper market, we would expect to be able to access funds under our liquidity facilities mentioned above.Shelf RegistrationWe have a universal shelf registration statement on file with the SEC under which we, as a well-known seasoned issuer, have the ability to issue and sell an indeterminate amount of various types of debt and equity securities.Other FinancingDuring 2013, we entered into a capital lease obligation for use of an oil terminal in the United Kingdom. The capital lease matures in 2033 and the present value of our minimum capital lease payments as of December 31, 2013, was $189 million.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsAs part of our normal ongoing business operations, we enter into agreements with other parties to pursue business opportunities, with costs and risks apportioned among the parties as provided by the agreements. In April 2012, in connection with the Separation, we entered into an agreement to guarantee 100 percent of certain outstanding debt obligations of MSLP. At December 31, 2013, the aggregate principal amount of MSLP debt guaranteed by us was $214 million. For additional information about guarantees, see Note 13—Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.45Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsCapital RequirementsFor information about our capital expenditures and investments, see “Capital Spending” below.Our debt balance at December 31, 2013, was $6.2 billion and our debt-to-capital ratio was 22 percent, within our target range of 20-to-30 percent. During 2013, we prepaid the $1 billion outstanding balance on our $2 billion term loan. As a result of this prepayment, we have no material scheduled debt maturities in 2014.On February 7, 2014, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.39 per common share, payable March 3, 2014, to holders of record at the close of business on February 18, 2014.During the second half of 2013, we entered into a construction agency agreement and an operating lease agreement with a financial institution to finance the construction of our new headquarters facility to be located in Houston, Texas. Under the construction agency agreement, we act as construction agent for the financial institution over a construction period of up to three years and eight months, during which we request draws from the financial institution to fund construction costs. The operating lease becomes effective after construction is substantially complete and we are able to occupy the facility. The operating lease has an initial term of five years and provides us the option, under specified circumstances, to request additional lease extensions, purchase the facility or assist the financial institution in marketing it for resale.During 2012, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $2 billion of our outstanding common stock. In October 2013, we completed our initial $2 billion share repurchase program. During 2013, our Board of Directors authorized additional share repurchases of $1 billion and $2 billion on July 30 and December 6, respectively. The share repurchases are expected to be funded primarily through available cash. The shares will be repurchased from time to time in the open market at the company’s discretion, subject to market conditions and other factors, and in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements and the Tax Sharing Agreement entered into in connection with the Separation. We are not obligated to acquire any particular amount of common stock and may commence, suspend or discontinue purchases at any time or from time to time without prior notice. Share repurchases under our repurchase programs totaled 44,106,380 shares at a cost of $2.6 billion through December 31, 2013. Shares of stock repurchased are held as treasury shares.On December 30, 2013, we announced that we had entered into an agreement to exchange PSPI for shares of our common stock held by the other party. Following customary regulatory review, the transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2014. For additional information, see ""Outlook"" below. 46Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsContractual ObligationsThe following table summarizes our aggregate contractual fixed and variable obligations as of December 31, 2013.

We expect these purchase obligations will be fulfilled by operating cash flows in the applicable maturity period. The majority of the purchase obligations are market-based contracts, including exchanges and futures, for the purchase of products such as crude oil and unfractionated NGL. The products are mostly used to supply our refineries and fractionators, optimize the supply chain, and resell to customers. Product purchase commitments with third parties totaled $66,614 million. In addition, $39,759 million are product purchases from CPChem, mostly for natural gas and NGL over the remaining contractual term of 86 years, and $6,792 million from Excel Paralubes, for base oil over the remaining contractual term of 11 years.Purchase obligations of $6,681 million are related to agreements to access and utilize the capacity of third-party equipment and facilities, including pipelines and product terminals, to transport, process, treat, and store products. The remainder is primarily our net share of purchase commitments for materials and services for jointly owned facilities where we are the operator.(c)Excludes pensions. For the 2014 through 2018 time period, we expect to contribute an average of $180 million per year to our qualified and nonqualified pension and other postretirement benefit plans in the United States and an average of $60 million per year to our non-U.S. plans, which are expected to be in excess of required minimums in many cases. The U.S. five-year average consists of $175 million for 2014 and then approximately $185 million per year for the remaining four years. Our minimum funding in 2014 is expected to be $175 million in the United States and $60 million outside the United States.(d)Excludes unrecognized tax benefits of $199 million because the ultimate disposition and timing of any payments to be made with regard to such amounts are not reasonably estimable or the amounts relate to potential refunds. Also excludes interest and penalties of $18 million. Although unrecognized tax benefits are not a contractual obligation, they are presented in this table because they represent potential demands on our liquidity.47Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsCapital Spending Millions of Dollars 2014Budget 2013 2012 2011Capital Expenditures and Investments Midstream*$1,417 528 704 122Chemicals— — — —Refining1,002 889 738 771Marketing and Specialties126 226 119 106Corporate and Other136 136 140 17Total consolidated from continuing operations$2,681 1,779 1,701 1,016 Discontinued operations$15 27 20 6 Selected Equity Affiliates** DCP Midstream*$750 971 1,324 779CPChem1,046 613 371 222WRB145 109 136 414 $1,941 1,693 1,831 1,415*2012 consolidated amount includes acquisition of a one-third interest in the Sand Hills and Southern Hills pipeline projects from DCP Midstream for $459 million. This amount was also included in DCP Midstream's capital spending, primarily in 2012. **Our share of capital spending, which is self-funded by the equity affiliate.MidstreamDuring the three-year period ended December 31, 2013, DCP Midstream had a self-funded capital program, and thus required no new capital infusions from us or our co-venturer, Spectra Energy Corp. During this three-year period, on a 100 percent basis, DCP Midstream’s capital expenditures and investments were $6.1 billion. In November 2012, we invested $0.5 billion in total to acquire a one-third direct interest in both the DCP Sand Hills and DCP Southern Hills pipeline entities. Phillips 66, Spectra Energy and DCP Midstream each own a one-third interest in each of the two pipeline entities, and both pipelines are operated by DCP Midstream. In 2013 we made additional investments in both the DCP Sand Hills and DCP Southern Hills pipeline entities, increasing our total direct investment to $0.8 billion.Other capital spending in our Midstream segment not related to DCP Midstream or the Sand Hills and Southern Hills pipelines over the three-year period was primarily for reliability and maintenance projects in our Transportation business.ChemicalsDuring the three-year period ended December 31, 2013, CPChem had a self-funded capital program, and thus required no new capital infusions from us or our co-venturer, Chevron U.S.A. Inc. (Chevron), an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Chevron Corporation. During the three-year period, on a 100 percent basis, CPChem’s capital expenditures and investments were $2.4 billion. In addition, CPChem's advances to equity affiliates, primarily used for project construction and start-up activities, were $0.5 billion and its repayments received from equity affiliates were $0.4 billion. Our agreement with Chevron regarding CPChem generally provides that instead of CPChem incurring debt, CPChem's owners would provide funding in the form of shareholder loans or capital as necessary to fund CPChem's capital requirements to the extent these requirements exceed CPChem's available cash from operations. We are currently forecasting CPChem to remain self-funding through 2014. RefiningCapital spending for the Refining segment during the three-year period ended December 31, 2013, was $2.4 billion, primarily for air emission reduction and clean fuels projects to meet new environmental standards, refinery upgrade projects to increase accessibility of advantaged crudes and improve product yields, improvements to the operating integrity of key processing units, and safety-related projects.48Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsKey projects completed during the three-year period included: •Installation of facilities to reduce nitrous oxide emissions from the crude furnace and installation of a new high-efficiency vacuum furnace at Bayway Refinery.•Completion of gasoline benzene reduction projects at the Alliance, Bayway, and Ponca City refineries.•Installation of new coke drums at the Billings Refinery.•Installation of a new waste heat boiler at the Bayway Refinery to reduce carbon monoxide emissions while providing steam production.Major construction activities in progress include: •Installation of facilities to reduce nitrous oxide emissions from the fluid catalytic cracker at the Alliance Refinery.•Installation of new coke drums at the Ponca City Refinery.•Installation of a tail gas treating unit at the Humber Refinery to reduce emissions from the sulfur recovery units.•Installation of rail racks to accept advantaged crude deliveries at the Bayway and Ferndale refineries.Generally, our equity affiliates in the Refining segment are intended to have self-funding capital programs. Although WRB did not require capital infusions from us during the three-year period ended December 31, 2013, we did provide loan financing to WRB to assist it in meeting its operating and capital spending requirements. WRB repaid these loans in full during 2011. During this three-year period, on a 100 percent basis, WRB’s capital expenditures and investments were $1.3 billion. We expect WRB’s 2014 capital program to be self-funding.Marketing and SpecialtiesCapital spending for the M&S segment during the three-year period ended December 31, 2013, was primarily for the acquisition of, and investments in, a limited number of retail sites in the western and Midwestern portions of the United States, reliability and maintenance projects, and projects targeted at growing our international marketing and specialties businesses.Corporate and OtherCapital spending for Corporate and Other during the three-year period ended December 31, 2013, was primarily for projects related to information technology and facilities.2014 BudgetOur 2014 planned capital budget is $2.7 billion. This excludes our portion of planned capital spending by DCP Midstream, CPChem and WRB totaling $1.9 billion, which is not expected to require cash outlays by us.In Midstream, we plan $1.4 billion of investment in our NGL Operations and Transportation business lines. This represents an increase of $0.9 billion over 2013. In 2014, we expect to begin construction of a 100,000 barrel-per-day NGL fractionator and a 4.4 million-barrel-per-month liquefied petroleum gas export terminal on the U.S. Gulf Coast. In addition, several rail offloading facilities and other crude handling projects will increase our access to advantaged refining feedstocks, while pipeline expansion and connection projects will grow capacity and allow for greater refined product exports.We plan to spend $1.0 billion of direct capital expenditures in Refining, approximately 70 percent of which will be for sustaining capital. These investments are related to reliability and maintenance, safety and environmental projects, including those to comply with Tier 3 emission standards. Other Refining capital investments will be directed toward relatively small, high-return projects, primarily to enhance use of advantaged crudes, as well as to improve product yields, increase energy efficiency and expand export capability.In the M&S segment, we plan to invest about $0.1 billion of growth and sustaining capital. The growth investment reflects our intent to expand the international fuels marketing business. Within Corporate and Other, we expect to invest approximately $0.1 billion in 2014 related to information technology and facilities.49Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsContingenciesA number of lawsuits involving a variety of claims have been made against us in connection with matters that arise in the ordinary course of business. We also may be required to remove or mitigate the effects on the environment of the placement, storage, disposal or release of certain chemical, mineral and petroleum substances at various active and inactive sites. We regularly assess the need for accounting recognition or disclosure of these contingencies. In the case of all known contingencies (other than those related to income taxes), we accrue a liability when the loss is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable. If a range of amounts can be reasonably estimated and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount, then the minimum of the range is accrued. We do not reduce these liabilities for potential insurance or third-party recoveries. If applicable, we accrue receivables for probable insurance or other third-party recoveries. In the case of income-tax-related contingencies, we use a cumulative probability-weighted loss accrual in cases where sustaining a tax position is less than certain.Based on currently available information, we believe it is remote that future costs related to known contingent liability exposures will exceed current accruals by an amount that would have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements. As we learn new facts concerning contingencies, we reassess our position both with respect to accrued liabilities and other potential exposures. Estimates particularly sensitive to future changes include contingent liabilities recorded for environmental remediation, tax and legal matters. Estimated future environmental remediation costs are subject to change due to such factors as the uncertain magnitude of cleanup costs, the unknown time and extent of such remedial actions that may be required, and the determination of our liability in proportion to that of other responsible parties. Estimated future costs related to tax and legal matters are subject to change as events evolve and as additional information becomes available during the administrative and litigation processes.Legal and Tax MattersOur legal organization applies its knowledge, experience and professional judgment to the specific characteristics of our cases, employing a litigation management process to manage and monitor the legal proceedings against us. Our process facilitates the early evaluation and quantification of potential exposures in individual cases. This process also enables us to track those cases that have been scheduled for trial and/or mediation. Based on professional judgment and experience in using these litigation management tools and available information about current developments in all our cases, our legal organization regularly assesses the adequacy of current accruals and determines if adjustment of existing accruals, or establishment of new accruals, are required. See Note 20—Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information about income-tax-related contingencies.EnvironmentalWe are subject to the same numerous international, federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations as other companies in our industry. The most significant of these environmental laws and regulations include, among others, the: •U.S. Federal Clean Air Act, which governs air emissions.•U.S. Federal Clean Water Act, which governs discharges to water bodies.•European Union Regulation for Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH), which governs the manufacture, placing on the market or use of chemicals.•U.S. Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), which imposes liability on generators, transporters and arrangers of hazardous substances at sites where hazardous substance releases have occurred or are threatening to occur.•U.S. Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), which governs the treatment, storage and disposal of solid waste.•U.S. Federal Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA), which requires facilities to report toxic chemical inventories to local emergency planning committees and response departments.•U.S. Federal Safe Drinking Water Act, which governs the disposal of wastewater in underground injection wells.•U.S. Federal Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA90), under which owners and operators of onshore facilities and pipelines, lessees or permittees of an area in which an offshore facility is located, and owners and operators of vessels are liable for removal costs and damages that result from a discharge of oil into navigable waters of the United States.50Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements•European Union Trading Directive resulting in the European Emissions Trading Scheme, which uses a market-based mechanism to incentivize the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.These laws and their implementing regulations set limits on emissions and, in the case of discharges to water, establish water quality limits. They also, in most cases, require permits in association with new or modified operations. These permits can require an applicant to collect substantial information in connection with the application process, which can be expensive and time consuming. In addition, there can be delays associated with notice and comment periods and the agency’s processing of the application. Many of the delays associated with the permitting process are beyond the control of the applicant.Many states and foreign countries where we operate also have, or are developing, similar environmental laws and regulations governing these same types of activities. While similar, in some cases these regulations may impose additional, or more stringent, requirements that can add to the cost and difficulty of marketing or transporting products across state and international borders.The ultimate financial impact arising from environmental laws and regulations is neither clearly known nor easily determinable as new standards, such as air emission standards, water quality standards and stricter fuel regulations, continue to evolve. However, environmental laws and regulations, including those that may arise to address concerns about global climate change, are expected to continue to have an increasing impact on our operations in the United States and in other countries in which we operate. Notable areas of potential impacts include air emission compliance and remediation obligations in the United States.An example in the fuels area is the Energy Policy Act of 2005, which imposed obligations to provide increasing volumes of renewable fuels in transportation motor fuels through 2012. These obligations were changed with the enactment of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA). EISA requires fuel producers and importers to provide additional renewable fuels for transportation motor fuels and stipulates a mix of various types to be included through 2022. We have met the increasingly stringent requirements to date while establishing implementation, operating and capital strategies, along with advanced technology development, to address projected future requirements. It is uncertain how various future requirements contained in EISA, and the regulations promulgated thereunder, may be implemented and what their full impact may be on our operations. Also, we may experience a decrease in demand for refined petroleum products due to the regulatory program as currently promulgated. For compliance year 2014, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposed to reduce the statutory volumes of advanced and total renewable fuel using authority granted to it under EISA. We do not know whether this reduction will be finalized as proposed or whether the EPA will utilize its authority to reduce statutory volumes in future compliance years.We also are subject to certain laws and regulations relating to environmental remediation obligations associated with current and past operations. Such laws and regulations include CERCLA and RCRA and their state equivalents. Remediation obligations include cleanup responsibility arising from petroleum releases from underground storage tanks located at numerous past and present owned and/or operated petroleum-marketing outlets throughout the United States. Federal and state laws require contamination caused by such underground storage tank releases be assessed and remediated to meet applicable standards. In addition to other cleanup standards, many states have adopted cleanup criteria for methyl tertiary-butyl ether (MTBE) for both soil and groundwater.At RCRA-permitted facilities, we are required to assess environmental conditions. If conditions warrant, we may be required to remediate contamination caused by prior operations. In contrast to CERCLA, which is often referred to as “Superfund,” the cost of corrective action activities under RCRA corrective action programs typically is borne solely by us. We anticipate increased expenditures for RCRA remediation activities may be required, but such annual expenditures for the near term are not expected to vary significantly from the range of such expenditures we have experienced over the past few years. Longer-term expenditures are subject to considerable uncertainty and may fluctuate significantly.We occasionally receive requests for information or notices of potential liability from the EPA and state environmental agencies alleging we are a potentially responsible party under CERCLA or an equivalent state statute. On occasion, we also have been made a party to cost recovery litigation by those agencies or by private parties. These requests, notices and lawsuits assert potential liability for remediation costs at various sites that typically are not owned by us, but allegedly contain wastes attributable to our past operations. As of December 31, 2012, we reported we had been notified of potential liability under CERCLA and comparable state laws at 48 sites around the United States. During 2013, we were notified of 3 new sites, settled and closed 1 site, and determined 15 sites were resolved, leaving 35 unresolved sites with potential liability at December 31, 2013. 51Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsFor most Superfund sites, our potential liability will be significantly less than the total site remediation costs because the percentage of waste attributable to us, versus that attributable to all other potentially responsible parties, is relatively low. Although liability of those potentially responsible is generally joint and several for federal sites and frequently so for state sites, other potentially responsible parties at sites where we are a party typically have had the financial strength to meet their obligations, and where they have not, or where potentially responsible parties could not be located, our share of liability has not increased materially. Many of the sites for which we are potentially responsible are still under investigation by the EPA or the state agencies concerned. Prior to actual cleanup, those potentially responsible normally assess site conditions, apportion responsibility and determine the appropriate remediation. In some instances, we may have no liability or attain a settlement of liability. Actual cleanup costs generally occur after the parties obtain EPA or equivalent state agency approval of a remediation plan. There are relatively few sites where we are a major participant, and given the timing and amounts of anticipated expenditures, neither the cost of remediation at those sites nor such costs at all CERCLA sites, in the aggregate, is expected to have a material adverse effect on our competitive or financial condition.Expensed environmental costs were $665 million in 2013 and are expected to be approximately $645 million in each of 2014 and 2015. Capitalized environmental costs were $252 million in 2013 and are expected to be approximately $365 million in each of 2014 and 2015. This amount does not include capital expenditures made for another purpose that have an indirect benefit on environmental compliance.Accrued liabilities for remediation activities are not reduced for potential recoveries from insurers or other third parties and are not discounted (except those assumed in a purchase business combination, which we record on a discounted basis).Many of these liabilities result from CERCLA, RCRA and similar state laws that require us to undertake certain investigative and remedial activities at sites where we conduct, or once conducted, operations or at sites where our generated waste was disposed. We also have accrued for a number of sites we identified that may require environmental remediation, but which are not currently the subject of CERCLA, RCRA or state enforcement activities. If applicable, we accrue receivables for probable insurance or other third-party recoveries. In the future, we may incur significant costs under both CERCLA and RCRA. Remediation activities vary substantially in duration and cost from site to site, depending on the mix of unique site characteristics, evolving remediation technologies, diverse regulatory agencies and enforcement policies, and the presence or absence of potentially liable third parties. Therefore, it is difficult to develop reasonable estimates of future site remediation costs.At December 31, 2013, our balance sheet included total accrued environmental costs of $492 million, compared with $530 million at December 31, 2012, and $542 million at December 31, 2011. We expect to incur a substantial amount of these expenditures within the next 30 years.Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, and as with other companies engaged in similar businesses, environmental costs and liabilities are inherent concerns in our operations and products, and there can be no assurance that material costs and liabilities will not be incurred. However, we currently do not expect any material adverse effect upon our results of operations or financial position as a result of compliance with current environmental laws and regulations.The EPA’s Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) program was implemented in accordance with the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and EISA. The RFS program sets annual quotas for the percentage of biofuels (such as ethanol) that must be blended into motor fuels consumed in the United States. A Renewable Identification Number (RIN) represents a serial number assigned to each gallon of biofuel produced or imported into the United States. As a producer of petroleum-based motor fuels, we are obligated to blend biofuels into the products we produce at a rate that is at least equal to the EPA’s quota and, to the extent we do not, we must purchase RINs in the open market to satisfy our obligation under the RFS program. The market for RINs has been the subject of fraudulent activity, and we have identified that we have unknowingly purchased RINs in the past that were invalid due to fraudulent activity. Although costs to replace fraudulently marketed RINs that have been determined to be invalid have not been material through December 31, 2013, it is reasonably possible that some additional RINs that we have previously purchased may also be determined to be invalid. Should that occur, we could incur additional replacement charges. Although the cost for replacing any additional fraudulently marketed RINs is not reasonably estimable at this time, we could have a possible exposure of approximately $150 million before tax. It could take several years for this possible exposure to reach ultimate resolution; therefore, we would not expect to incur the full financial impact of additional fraudulent RIN replacement costs in any single interim or annual period.52Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsClimate ChangeThere has been a broad range of proposed or promulgated state, national and international laws focusing on greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction. These proposed or promulgated laws apply or could apply in countries where we have interests or may have interests in the future. Laws in this field continue to evolve, and while it is not possible to accurately estimate either a timetable for implementation or our future compliance costs relating to implementation, such laws, if enacted, could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition. Examples of legislation or precursors for possible regulation that do or could affect our operations include: •European Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS), the program through which many of the European Union (EU) member states are implementing the Kyoto Protocol.•California’s Global Warming Solutions Act, which requires the California Air Resources Board to develop regulations and market mechanisms that will target reduction of California’s GHG emissions by 25 percent by 2020.•The U.S. Supreme Court decision in Massachusetts v. EPA, 549 U.S. 497, 127 S. Ct. 1438 (2007), confirming that the EPA has the authority to regulate carbon dioxide as an “air pollutant” under the Federal Clean Air Act.•The EPA’s announcement on March 29, 2010 (published as “Interpretation of Regulations that Determine Pollutants Covered by Clean Air Act Permitting Programs,” 75 Fed. Reg. 17004 (April 2, 2010)), and the EPA’s and U.S. Department of Transportation’s joint promulgation of a Final Rule on April 1, 2010, that triggers regulation of GHGs under the Clean Air Act. These collectively may lead to more climate-based claims for damages, and may result in longer agency review time for development projects to determine the extent of potential climate change. Challenges to both the announcement and rulemaking were denied by the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit (see Coalition for Responsible Regulation v. EPA, 684 F.3d 102 (D.C. Cir. 2012)), but are now pending before the U.S. Supreme Court. •Carbon taxes in certain jurisdictions.•GHG emission cap and trade programs in certain jurisdictions. In the EU, we have assets that are subject to the ETS. The first phase of the ETS was completed at the end of 2007 and Phase II ran from 2008 through 2012. Phase III runs from 2013 through 2020 and there will likely be a significant increase in auctioning levels, including 100 percent auctioning to the power sector in the United Kingdom and across most of the EU. We are actively engaged to minimize any financial impact from the trading scheme. In the United States, some additional form of regulation may be forthcoming in the future at the federal or state levels with respect to GHG emissions. Such regulation could take any of several forms that may result in the creation of additional costs in the form of taxes, the restriction of output, investments of capital to maintain compliance with laws and regulations, or required acquisition or trading of emission allowances. We are working to continuously improve operational and energy efficiency through resource and energy conservation throughout our operations.Compliance with changes in laws and regulations that create a GHG emission trading scheme or GHG reduction requirements could significantly increase our costs, reduce demand for fossil energy derived products, impact the cost and availability of capital and increase our exposure to litigation. Such laws and regulations could also increase demand for less carbon intensive energy sources. An example of one such program is California's cap and trade program, which was promulgated pursuant to the State's Global Warming Solutions Act. The program currently is limited to certain stationary sources, which include our refineries in California, but beginning in 2015 will expand to include emissions from transportation fuels distributed in California. We expect inclusion of transportation fuels in California's cap and trade program as currently promulgated would increase our cap and trade program compliance costs. The ultimate impact on our financial performance, either positive or negative, from this and similar programs, will depend on a number of factors, including, but not limited to: •Whether and to what extent legislation or regulation is enacted.•The nature of the legislation or regulation (such as a cap and trade system or a tax on emissions).•The GHG reductions required.•The price and availability of offsets.•The amount and allocation of allowances.53Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements•Technological and scientific developments leading to new products or services.•Any potential significant physical effects of climate change (such as increased severe weather events, changes in sea levels and changes in temperature).•Whether, and the extent to which, increased compliance costs are ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services.CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATESThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to select appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. See Note 2—Accounting Policies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for descriptions of our major accounting policies. Certain of these accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent that there is a reasonable likelihood that materially different amounts would have been reported under different conditions, or if different assumptions had been used. The following discussion of critical accounting estimates, along with the discussion of contingencies in this report, address all important accounting areas where the nature of accounting estimates or assumptions could be material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change.ImpairmentsLong-lived assets used in operations are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate a possible significant deterioration in future cash flows is expected to be generated by an asset group. If, upon review, the sum of the undiscounted pre-tax cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset group, the carrying value is written down to estimated fair value. Individual assets are grouped for impairment purposes based on a judgmental assessment of the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets—generally at an entire refinery complex level. Because there usually is a lack of quoted market prices for long-lived assets, the fair value of impaired assets is typically determined based on the present values of expected future cash flows using discount rates believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants, or based on a multiple of operating cash flows validated with historical market transactions of similar assets where possible. The expected future cash flows used for impairment reviews and related fair value calculations are based on judgmental assessments of future volumes, commodity prices, operating costs, margins, discount rates and capital project decisions, considering all available information at the date of review.Investments in nonconsolidated entities accounted for under the equity method are reviewed for impairment when there is evidence of a loss in value. Such evidence of a loss in value might include our inability to recover the carrying amount, the lack of sustained earnings capacity which would justify the current investment amount, or a current fair value less than the investment’s carrying amount. When it is determined such a loss in value is other than temporary, an impairment charge is recognized for the difference between the investment’s carrying value and its estimated fair value. When determining whether a decline in value is other than temporary, management considers factors such as the length of time and extent of the decline, the investee’s financial condition and near-term prospects, and our ability and intention to retain our investment for a period that will be sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in the market value of the investment. When quoted market prices are not available, the fair value is usually based on the present value of expected future cash flows using discount rates believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants, plus market analysis of comparable assets owned by the investee, if appropriate. Differing assumptions could affect the timing and the amount of an impairment of an investment in any period.Asset Retirement ObligationsUnder various contracts, permits and regulations, we have material legal obligations to remove tangible equipment and restore the land at the end of operations at certain operational sites. Our largest asset removal obligations involve asbestos abatement at refineries. Estimating the future asset removal costs necessary for this accounting calculation is difficult. Most of these removal obligations are many years, or decades, in the future and the contracts and regulations often have vague descriptions of what removal practices and criteria must be met when the removal event actually occurs. Asset removal technologies and costs, regulatory and other compliance considerations, expenditure timing, and other inputs into valuation of the obligation, including discount and inflation rates, are also subject to change.54Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsEnvironmental CostsIn addition to asset retirement obligations discussed above, under the above or similar contracts, permits and regulations, we have certain obligations to complete environmental-related projects. These projects are primarily related to cleanup at domestic refineries, underground storage sites and non-operated sites. Future environmental remediation costs are difficult to estimate because they are subject to change due to such factors as the uncertain magnitude of cleanup costs, the unknown time and extent of such remedial actions that may be required, and the determination of our liability in proportion to that of other responsible parties.Intangible Assets and GoodwillAt December 31, 2013, we had $694 million of intangible assets determined to have indefinite useful lives, and thus they are not amortized. This judgmental assessment of an indefinite useful life must be continuously evaluated in the future. If, due to changes in facts and circumstances, management determines these intangible assets have finite useful lives, amortization will commence at that time on a prospective basis. As long as these intangible assets are judged to have indefinite lives, they will be subject to annual impairment tests that require management’s judgment of the estimated fair value of these intangible assets.At December 31, 2013, we had $3.1 billion of goodwill recorded in conjunction with past business combinations. Goodwill is not amortized. Instead, goodwill is subject to at least annual reviews for impairment at a reporting unit level. The reporting unit or units used to evaluate and measure goodwill for impairment are determined primarily from the manner in which the business is managed. A reporting unit is an operating segment or a component that is one level below an operating segment.Effective January 1, 2013, we realigned our operating segments and determined that goodwill (which, prior to the realignment, had been assigned fully to our former R&M segment) should now be assigned to three of the realigned operating segments—Midstream, Refining and M&S. We further determined that, for the Midstream segment, Transportation constituted a reporting unit. For the Refining and M&S segments, we determined the goodwill reporting unit was at the operating segment level, due to the economic similarities of the components of those segments.Goodwill was reassigned to the realigned reporting units using a relative fair value approach. Goodwill impairment testing was completed and no impairment recognition was required. In the future, the sale or disposition of a significant asset within a reporting unit will be allocated a portion of that reporting unit's goodwill, based on relative fair values, which will adjust the amount of gain or loss on the sale or disposition.Because quoted market prices for our reporting units were not available, management applied judgment in determining the estimated fair values of the reporting units for purposes of performing the goodwill impairment test. Management used all available information to make this fair value determination, including observed market earnings multiples of comparable companies, our common stock price and associated total company market capitalization and the present values of expected future cash flows using discount rates commensurate with the risks involved in the assets.During the fourth quarter of 2013, we estimated that the fair values of the Transportation, Refining and M&S reporting units were approximately 220 percent, 30 percent and 45 percent higher than the recorded net book values (including goodwill) of these reporting units, respectively. However, a lower fair value estimate in the future could result in an impairment. A prolonged or significant decline in our stock price could provide evidence of a need to record a material impairment of goodwill.Tax Assets and LiabilitiesOur operations are subject to various taxes, including federal, state and foreign income taxes and transactional taxes such as excise, sales/use, property and payroll taxes. We record tax liabilities based on our assessment of existing tax laws and regulations. The recording of tax liabilities requires significant judgment and estimates. We recognize the financial statement effects of an income tax position when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination by a taxing authority. A contingent liability related to a transactional tax claim is recorded if the loss is both probable and estimable. Actual incurred tax liabilities can vary from our estimates for a variety of reasons, including different interpretations of tax laws and regulations and different assessments of the amount of tax due.In determining our income tax provision, we assess the likelihood our deferred tax assets will be recovered through future taxable income. Valuation allowances reduce deferred tax assets to an amount that will, more likely than not, be realized. 55Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsJudgment is required in estimating the amount of valuation allowance, if any, that should be recorded against our deferred tax assets. Based on our historical taxable income, our expectations for the future, and available tax-planning strategies, we expect the net deferred tax assets will more likely than not be realized as offsets to reversing deferred tax liabilities and as reductions to future taxable income. If our actual results of operations differ from such estimates or our estimates of future taxable income change, the valuation allowance may need to be revised.New tax laws and regulations, as well as changes to existing tax laws and regulations, are continuously being proposed or promulgated. The implementation of future legislative and regulatory tax initiatives could result in increased tax liabilities that cannot be predicted at this time.Projected Benefit Obligations Determination of the projected benefit obligations for our defined benefit pension and postretirement plans are important to the recorded amounts for such obligations on the balance sheet and to the amount of benefit expense in the income statement. The actuarial determination of projected benefit obligations and company contribution requirements involves judgment about uncertain future events, including estimated retirement dates, salary levels at retirement, mortality rates, lump-sum election rates, rates of return on plan assets, future health care cost-trend rates, and rates of utilization of health care services by retirees. Due to the specialized nature of these calculations, we engage outside actuarial firms to assist in the determination of these projected benefit obligations and company contribution requirements. Due to differing objectives and requirements between financial accounting rules and the pension plan funding regulations promulgated by governmental agencies, the actuarial methods and assumptions for the two purposes differ in certain important respects. Ultimately, we will be required to fund all promised benefits under pension and postretirement benefit plans not funded by plan assets or investment returns, but the judgmental assumptions used in the actuarial calculations significantly affect periodic financial statements and funding patterns over time. Benefit expense is particularly sensitive to the discount rate and return on plan assets assumptions. A 1 percent decrease in the discount rate assumption would increase annual benefit expense by an estimated $60 million, while a 1 percent decrease in the return on plan assets assumption would increase annual benefit expense by an estimated $30 million. In determining the discount rate, we use yields on high-quality fixed income investments with payments matched to the estimated distributions of benefits from our plans.In 2013 and 2012, the company used an expected long-term rate of return of 7 percent for the U.S. pension plan assets, which account for 75 percent of the company’s pension plan assets. The actual asset returns for 2013 and 2012 were 16 percent and 5 percent, respectively. For the eight years prior to the Separation, actual asset returns averaged 7 percent for the U.S. pension plan assets. The 2013 asset returns of 16 percent were associated with a broad recovery in the financial markets during the year.OUTLOOKOn December 30, 2013, we entered into an agreement pursuant to which we will exchange all of our common stock in PSPI for shares of Phillips 66 common stock owned by the other party. We expect PSPI's balance sheet at closing to include approximately $450 million of cash and cash equivalents. The exact number of Phillips 66 shares to be delivered will be determined by reference to the volume weighted average price of Phillips 66 common stock on the closing date. Had the closing occurred on February 14, 2014, approximately 18 million shares of Phillips 66 common stock would have been exchanged. The reacquired stock will be held as treasury shares. Following customary regulatory review, the transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2014. We expect to record a gain of approximately $710 million when the transaction closes, subject to working capital and other adjustments. On February 13, 2014, we entered into an agreement to contribute to Phillips 66 Partners certain transportation, terminaling and storage assets for total consideration of $700 million. These assets consist of our Gold Product Pipeline System and the Medford Spheres, two newly constructed refinery-grade propylene storage spheres. Phillips 66 Partners expects to finance the acquisition with cash on hand of $400 million, the issuance of additional units valued at $140 million, and a five-year, $160 million note payable to a subsidiary of Phillips 66. The number of additional units will be based on the average daily closing price of Phillips 66 Partners’ common units for the 10 trading days prior to February 13, 2014, or $38.86 per unit, with 98 percent issued as common units and 2 percent issued as general partner units. The transaction is targeted to occur on March 1, 2014.56Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsItem 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKFinancial Instrument Market RiskWe and certain of our subsidiaries hold and issue derivative contracts and financial instruments that expose our cash flows or earnings to changes in commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates. We may use financial- and commodity-based derivative contracts to manage the risks produced by changes in the prices of crude oil and related products, natural gas and electric power; fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates; or to capture market opportunities.Our use of derivative instruments is governed by an “Authority Limitations” document approved by our Board of Directors that prohibits the use of highly leveraged derivatives or derivative instruments without sufficient market liquidity for comparable valuations. The Authority Limitations document also establishes the Value at Risk (VaR) limits for us, and compliance with these limits is monitored daily. Our Chief Financial Officer monitors risks resulting from foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. Our Executive Vice President over the Commercial organization monitors commodity price risk. The Commercial organization manages our commercial marketing, optimizes our commodity flows and positions, and monitors related risks of our businesses.Commodity Price RiskWe sell into or receive supply from the worldwide crude oil, refined products, natural gas, NGL, and electric power markets and are exposed to fluctuations in the prices for these commodities.These fluctuations can affect our revenues and purchases, as well as the cost of operating, investing and financing activities. Generally, our policy is to remain exposed to the market prices of commodities.Our Commercial organization uses futures, forwards, swaps and options in various markets to optimize the value of our supply chain, which may move our risk profile away from market average prices to accomplish the following objectives: •Balance physical systems. In addition to cash settlement prior to contract expiration, exchange-traded futures contracts also may be settled by physical delivery of the commodity, providing another source of supply to meet our refinery requirements or marketing demand.•Meet customer needs. Consistent with our policy to generally remain exposed to market prices, we use swap contracts to convert fixed-price sales contracts, which are often requested by refined product consumers, to a floating-market price.•Manage the risk to our cash flows from price exposures on specific crude oil, refined product, natural gas, and electric power transactions.•Enable us to use the market knowledge gained from these activities to capture market opportunities such as moving physical commodities to more profitable locations, storing commodities to capture seasonal or time premiums, and blending commodities to capture quality upgrades. Derivatives may be utilized to optimize these activities.We use a VaR model to estimate the loss in fair value that could potentially result on a single day from the effect of adverse changes in market conditions on the derivative financial instruments and derivative commodity instruments held or issued, including commodity purchase and sales contracts recorded on the balance sheet at December 31, 2013, as derivative instruments. Using Monte Carlo simulation, a 95 percent confidence level and a one-day holding period, the VaR for those instruments issued or held for trading purposes at December 31, 2013 and 2012, were immaterial to our cash flows and net income.The VaR for instruments held for purposes other than trading at December 31, 2013 and 2012, were also immaterial to our cash flows and net income.57Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsInterest Rate RiskThe following tables provide information about our debt instruments that are sensitive to changes in U.S. interest rates. These tables present principal cash flows and related weighted-average interest rates by expected maturity dates. Weighted-average variable rates are based on effective rates at the reporting date. The carrying amount of our floating-rate debt approximates its fair value. The fair value of the fixed-rate financial instruments is estimated based on quoted market prices.

Readers are cautioned that such forward-looking statements should be read in conjunction with the company’s disclosures under the heading: “CAUTIONARY STATEMENT FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE ‘SAFE HARBOR’ PROVISIONS OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995,” beginning on page 64.The terms “earnings” and “loss” as used in Management’s Discussion and Analysis refer to net income (loss) attributable to Phillips 66.BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND EXECUTIVE OVERVIEWPhillips 66 is an energy manufacturing and logistics company with midstream, chemicals, refining, and marketing and specialties businesses. At December 31, 2014, we had total assets of $48.7 billion.The SeparationOn April 4, 2012, the ConocoPhillips Board of Directors approved the separation of its downstream businesses into an independent, publicly traded company named Phillips 66. In accordance with the Separation and Distribution Agreement, the two companies were separated by ConocoPhillips distributing to its stockholders all 625,272,302 shares of common stock of Phillips 66 after the market closed on April 30, 2012 (the Separation). Each ConocoPhillips stockholder received one share of Phillips 66 stock for every two shares of ConocoPhillips stock. Following the Separation, ConocoPhillips retained no ownership interest in Phillips 66, and each company has separate public ownership, boards of directors and management. Executive OverviewIn 2014, we reported earnings of $4.8 billion, generated $3.5 billion in cash from operating activities, and received $1.2 billion from asset dispositions, primarily reflecting the sale of our interest in the Malaysian Refining Company Sdn. Bdh. (MRC) and a special distribution from WRB Refining. We used available cash primarily to fund capital expenditures and investments of $3.8 billion, pay dividends of $1.1 billion, repurchase $2.3 billion of our common stock and finance $450 million of the Phillips Specialty Products Inc. (PSPI) share exchange. We issued $2.5 billion of debt, and ended 2014 with $5.2 billion of cash and cash equivalents and approximately $4.9 billion of total capacity under our available liquidity facilities. 32Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsWe continue to focus on the following strategic priorities:•Maintain strong operating excellence. Safety and reliability are our first priority, and we are committed to protecting the health and safety of everyone who has a role in our operations and the communities in which we operate. Continuous improvement in safety, environmental stewardship, reliability and cost efficiency is a fundamental requirement for our company and employees. We employ rigorous training and audit programs to drive ongoing improvement in both personal and process safety as we strive for zero incidents. Since we cannot control commodity prices, controlling operating expenses and overhead costs, within the context of our commitment to safety and environmental stewardship, is a high priority. We actively monitor these costs using various methodologies that are reported to senior management. We are committed to protecting the environment and strive to reduce our environmental footprint throughout our operations. Optimizing utilization rates at our refineries through reliable and safe operations enables us to capture the value available in the market in terms of prices and margins. During 2014, our worldwide refining crude oil capacity utilization rate was 94 percent, compared with 93 percent in 2013. •Deliver profitable growth. We have budgeted $4.6 billion in capital expenditures and investments in 2015. Including our share of expected capital spending by joint ventures DCP Midstream, LLC (DCP Midstream), Chevron Phillips Chemical Company (CPChem) and WRB, our total 2015 capital program is expected to be $6.7 billion. This program is designed primarily to grow our Midstream and Chemicals segments, which have planned expansions for manufacturing and logistics capacity. The need for additional new gathering and processing, pipeline, storage and distribution infrastructure–driven by domestic unconventional crude oil, natural gas liquids (NGL) and natural gas production–is creating capital investment opportunities in our Midstream business. Over the next few years, CPChem plans significant reinvestment of its earnings to build additional processing capacity benefiting from lower-cost NGL feedstocks. We continue to focus on funding the most attractive growth opportunities across our portfolio.In 2013, we formed Phillips 66 Partners, a master limited partnership, to own, operate, develop and acquire primarily fee-based crude oil, refined petroleum product and NGL pipelines and terminals, as well as other transportation and midstream assets. Its assets consist of crude oil and refined petroleum product pipeline, terminal and storage systems in the Central and Gulf Coast regions of the United States, as well as two crude oil rail-unloading facilities located at or adjacent to our Bayway and Ferndale refineries.•Enhance returns. We plan to improve refining returns through greater use of advantaged feedstocks, disciplined capital allocation and portfolio optimization. We expect to drive higher returns in Marketing and Specialties (M&S) by selling finished products to higher-margin export markets. A disciplined capital allocation process ensures that we focus investments in projects that generate competitive returns throughout the business cycle. During 2014, 94 percent of the company's U.S. crude slate was advantaged, compared with 74 percent in 2013. •Grow shareholder distributions. We believe shareholder value is enhanced through, among other things, consistent and ongoing growth of regular dividends, supplemented by share repurchases. We increased our dividend rate by 28 percent during 2014, and it has more than doubled since the Separation. Regular dividends demonstrate the confidence our management has in our capital structure and its capability to generate free cash flow throughout the business cycle. Cumulatively through December 31, 2014, we have repurchased $4.9 billion, or approximately 73.2 million shares, of our common stock. At the discretion of our Board of Directors, we plan to increase dividends annually and fund our share repurchase program while continuing to invest in the growth of our business.•Build on a high-performing organization. We strive to attract, train, develop and retain individuals with the knowledge and skills to implement our business strategy and who support our values and ethics. Throughout the company, we focus on getting results in the right way and believe success is both what we do and how we do it. We encourage collaboration throughout our company, while valuing differences, respecting diversity of thought, and creating a great place to work. We foster an environment of learning and development through structured programs focused on building functional and technical skills where employees are engaged in our business and committed to their own, as well as the company’s, success. 33Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsBusiness EnvironmentThe Midstream segment includes our 50 percent equity investment in DCP Midstream. Earnings of DCP Midstream are closely linked to NGL prices, natural gas prices and crude oil prices. Industry NGL annual average prices decreased from 2012 to 2013 and again from 2013 to 2014, due to relatively higher inventories driven by growing NGL production from liquids-rich shale plays with limited corresponding domestic demand increase from the petrochemical industry and constrained export capacity. Natural gas prices increased from 2012 to 2013, and continued to increase from 2013 to 2014. The increase in both periods reflected concerns over increasingly lower industry inventory levels, due to steep inventory draws in 2013 and 2014, as well as domestic pipeline constraints. The Chemicals segment consists of our 50 percent equity investment in CPChem. The chemicals and plastics industry is mainly a commodity-based industry where the margins for key products are based on market factors. The chemicals and plastics industry continued to experience higher ethylene margins in regions of the world where production is based upon NGL versus crude-derived feedstocks. In particular, companies with North American ethane-based crackers benefited from the lower-priced feedstocks and improved ethylene margins, as well as improved margins for polyethylene and other ethylene derivatives. Results for our Refining segment depend largely on refining margins, cost control, refinery throughput, and product yields. The crack spread is a measure of the difference between market prices for refined petroleum products and crude oil, and it is used within our industry as an indicator for refining margins. The U.S. 3:2:1 crack spread (three barrels of crude oil producing two barrels of gasoline and one barrel of diesel) decreased from 2012 to 2013. However, for the first three quarters of 2014, the U.S. crack spread improved over 2013, primarily resulting from increased access to advantaged crude runs and a decrease in imports. Midcontinent refiners were especially strong, which was attributed to the region’s crude feedstock advantage. The decrease in U.S. crack spreads during the fourth quarter of 2014 was significant enough to drive the annual domestic industry average for 2014 lower than 2013. This decrease was largely due to gasoline prices falling faster than crude prices, resulting in a tighter margin. U.S. crude production continues to increase and nationwide growth is benefiting from slower decline rates in legacy production areas, as well as improved drilling efficiency. Limited infrastructure for takeaway options resulted in favorable feedstock prices for U.S. refiners with access to advantaged crudes. Midcontinent refiners were especially advantaged. Sustained pressure on inventories and lack of local gathering infrastructure in the Midcontinent caused West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude to continue trading at a discount relative to crudes such as Light Louisiana Sweet (LLS) and Brent during 2014. Refineries capable of processing WTI crude and crude oils that price relative to WTI, primarily the Midcontinent and Gulf Coast refineries, benefited from these lower regional feedstock prices. The spread between WTI and Brent narrowed considerably over the year, stemming from increased pipeline outlets from Cushing to the Gulf Coast, as well as the gradual over supply of light crude in the Atlantic basin.The Northwest Europe benchmark crack spread decreased from 2012 to 2013. In 2014, the crack spread increased in the first three quarters of the year and then declined in the fourth quarter, resulting in an average decrease in 2014 compared to 2013. The decline in benchmark crack spread was due to lower European domestic and export product demand on weak refinery economics while large volumes of imported diesel from the United States, India, Asia Pacific and Russia kept prices under pressure. Weak domestic European demand and reduced export markets for gasoline compounded the declining product crack spreads. Results for our M&S segment depend largely on marketing fuel margins, lubricant margins and other specialty product margins. These margins are primarily based on market factors, largely determined by the relationship between demand and supply. Marketing fuel margins are primarily determined by the trend of the spot prices for refined products. Generally, a downward trend of spot prices has a favorable impact on marketing fuel margins, while an upward trend of spot prices has an unfavorable impact on marketing fuel margins. Crude oil prices declined significantly during 2014, which resulted in the expected benefit to marketing margins. 34Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsRESULTS OF OPERATIONSBasis of PresentationSee Note 1—Separation and Basis of Presentation, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for information on the basis of presentation of our financial information that affects the comparability of financial information for periods before and after the Separation.Effective January 1, 2014, we changed the organizational structure of the internal financial information reviewed by our chief executive officer, and determined this resulted in a change in the composition of our operating segments. The primary effects of this reporting reorganization were:•We moved two of our equity investments, Excel Paralubes and Jupiter Sulphur, LLC, as well as the commission revenues related to needle and anode coke, polypropylene and solvents, from the Refining segment to the M&S segment.•We moved several refining logistics projects from the Refining segment to the Midstream Segment. The new segment alignment is presented for the periods ending December 31, 2014, with prior periods recast for comparability.

This decrease was partially offset by:•Lower impairment expense in 2013. We recorded impairments related to our equity investments in MRC, a refining company in Melaka, Malaysia, and Rockies Express Pipeline LLC (REX), a natural gas transmission system, in 2012.•Improved worldwide marketing margins.•Lower CPChem interest expense and costs resulting from its early debt retirements in 2012. See the “Segment Results” section for additional information on our segment results.Income Statement Analysis2014 vs. 2013 Sales and other operating revenues decreased 6 percent in 2014, while purchased crude oil and products decreased 8 percent. The decreases were primarily due to lower average prices for crude oil and petroleum products.Equity in earnings of affiliates decreased 20 percent in 2014, primarily resulting from decreased earnings from WRB and DCP Midstream, partially offset by increased equity earnings from CPChem. •Equity in earnings of WRB decreased 69 percent, mainly due to lower refining margins in the Central Corridor as a result of lower market crack spreads and a lower feedstock advantage, as well as lower interest income received from equity affiliates. •Equity in earnings of DCP Midstream decreased 36 percent, primarily due to a decrease in most commodity prices, as well as increased costs associated with planned asset growth. •Equity in earnings of CPChem increased 20 percent, primarily driven by improved ethylene and polyethylene realized margins related to increased sales prices. Net gain on dispositions in 2014 were $295 million, compared with $55 million in 2013, primarily resulting from net gains associated with the sale of our interest in MRC in the amount of $145 million, as well as the partial recognition of the previously deferred gain related to the sale of ICHP in the amount of $126 million. In 2013, net gain on dispositions primarily resulted from a $48 million gain on the sale of our E-GasTM Technology business. For additional information, see Note 7—Assets Held for Sale or Sold, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 13 percent in 2014, primarily due to additional fees under marketing consignment fuels agreements, as well as costs associated with acquisitions. 36Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsImpairments in 2014 were $150 million, compared with $29 million in 2013. In 2014, we recorded a $131 million impairment of the Whitegate Refinery. For additional information, see Note 11—Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. See Note 22—Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for information regarding our provision for income taxes and effective tax rates.Income from discontinued operations increased $645 million in 2014, compared to 2013, due to the completion of the PSPI share exchange in 2014. See Note 7—Assets Held for Sale or Sold, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information on this transaction. 2013 vs. 2012 Sales and other operating revenues and purchased crude oil and products both decreased 4 percent in 2013. The decreases were primarily due to lower average prices for crude oil and petroleum products.Equity in earnings of affiliates decreased 2 percent in 2013, primarily resulting from decreased earnings from WRB, partially offset by increased equity earnings from CPChem.•Equity in earnings of WRB decreased 21 percent, mainly due to lower refining margins in the Central Corridor as a result of lower market crack spreads.•Equity in earnings of CPChem increased 14 percent, primarily driven by the absence of costs and interest associated with CPChem's early retirement of debt in 2012, improved realized margins, higher equity earnings from CPChem's equity affiliates and the absence of 2012 fixed asset impairments. These increases were partially offset by lower olefins and polyolefins sales volumes related to ethylene outages. In addition, increased turnaround and maintenance activity resulted in lower volumes and higher costs.Net gain on dispositions decreased 72 percent in 2013, primarily resulting from a net gain associated with the sale of the Trainer Refinery and associated terminal and pipeline assets in 2012, compared with a gain resulting from the sale of our E-GasTM Technology business in 2013. For additional information, see Note 7—Assets Held for Sale or Sold, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 13 percent in 2013, primarily due to costs associated with the Separation and costs relating to a prior retail disposition program in 2012.Impairments in 2013 were $29 million, compared with $1,158 million in 2012. Impairments in 2012 included our investments in MRC and REX; a marine terminal and associated assets; and equipment formerly associated with the canceled Wilhelmshaven Refinery (WRG) upgrade project.

The Midstream segment purchases raw natural gas from producers and gathers natural gas through an extensive network of pipeline gathering systems. The natural gas is then processed to extract NGL from the raw gas stream. The remaining “residue” gas is marketed to electric utilities, industrial users and gas marketing companies. Most of the NGLs are fractionated—separated into individual components such as ethane, propane and butane—and marketed as chemical feedstock, fuel or blendstock. In addition, the Midstream segment includes U.S. transportation, pipeline, terminaling, and refining logistics services associated with the movement of crude oil, refined and specialty products, natural gas and NGL, as well as NGL fractionation, trading, and marketing businesses in the United States. The Midstream segment includes our 50 percent equity investment in DCP Midstream and the consolidated results of Phillips 66 Partners LP. 2014 vs. 2013 Earnings from the Midstream segment increased $38 million in 2014, compared with 2013. The improvement was primarily driven by higher earnings from our Transportation and NGL businesses, partially offset by lower earnings from DCP Midstream. Transportation earnings increased $34 million in 2014, compared with 2013. This increase primarily resulted from increased throughput fees, as well as higher earnings associated with railcar activity in 2014. These increases were partially offset by higher earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests, reflecting the contribution of previously wholly owned assets to Phillips 66 Partners. 38Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsThe $75 million decrease in earnings of DCP Midstream in 2014 primarily resulted from a decrease in NGL and crude prices in the latter part of 2014. NGL and crude prices have continued to decline in the early part of 2015. In addition, earnings decreased as costs associated with asset growth and maintenance increased in 2014, compared with 2013. Earnings further declined due to DCP Midstream’s contribution of assets to its publicly traded master limited partnership, DCP Partners. Following the contribution, a percentage of the earnings from these assets are attributable to public unitholders, thus decreasing income attributable to DCP Midstream and, thereby, Phillips 66. See the “Business Environment and Executive Overview” section for additional information on market factors impacting DCP Midstream’s results.DCP Partners issues, from time to time, limited partner units to the public. These issuances benefited our equity in earnings from DCP Midstream, on an after-tax basis, by approximately $45 million in 2014, compared with approximately $62 million in 2013.The NGL business had an increase in earnings of $79 million, compared with 2013. The increase was primarily due to improved margins driven by strong propane prices in early 2014. Additionally, 2014 earnings benefited from gains related to seasonal propane and butane storage activity. Also, earnings improved due to higher equity earnings from the DCP Sand Hills and DCP Southern Hills pipeline entities. These increases were partially offset by an increase in costs associated with growth projects. 2013 vs. 2012 Earnings from the Midstream segment increased $417 million in 2013, compared with 2012. The improvement was primarily driven by higher earnings from our Transportation business and DCP Midstream, partially offset by lower earnings from NGL. Transportation earnings increased $409 million in 2013, compared with 2012. These increases primarily resulted from lower impairments in 2013, as well as increased throughput fees. In 2012, we recorded impairments totaling $303 million after-tax on our equity investment in REX, primarily reflecting a diminished view of fair value of west-to-east natural gas transmission, due to the impact of shale gas production in the northeast. For additional information on the REX impairment, see Note 11—Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Throughput fees were higher in 2013, primarily due to the implementation of market-based intersegment transfer prices for transportation and terminaling services during 2013.The $31 million increase in earnings of DCP Midstream in 2013 primarily resulted from an increase in gains associated with unit issuances by DCP Partners, as described below. In addition, higher natural gas and crude oil prices benefitted earnings. These increases were partially offset by lower NGL prices and higher interest expense. DCP Partners unit issuances benefited our equity in earnings from DCP Midstream, on an after-tax basis, by approximately $62 million in 2013, compared with approximately $24 million in 2012.NGL decreased $23 million in 2013, compared with 2012. The decrease was primarily due to inventory impacts, reflecting inventory reductions in 2012 in anticipation of the Separation, which caused liquidations of LIFO inventory values. 39Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsChemicals Year Ended December 31 2014 2013 2012 Millions of Dollars Net Income Attributable to Phillips 66$1,137 986 823 Millions of PoundsCPChem Externally Marketed Sales Volumes* Olefins and Polyolefins16,815 16,071 14,967Specialties, Aromatics and Styrenics6,294 6,230 6,719 23,109 22,301 21,686*Represents 100 percent of CPChem’s outside sales of produced petrochemical products, as well as commission sales from equity affiliates. Olefins and Polyolefins Capacity Utilization (percent)88% 88 93The Chemicals segment consists of our 50 percent interest in CPChem, which we account for under the equity method. CPChem uses NGL and other feedstocks to produce petrochemicals. These products are then marketed and sold or used as feedstocks to produce plastics and other chemicals. CPChem’s business is structured around two primary operating segments: Olefins and Polyolefins (O&P) and Specialties, Aromatics and Styrenics (SA&S). The O&P segment produces and markets ethylene and other olefin products; ethylene produced is primarily consumed within CPChem for the production of polyethylene, normal alpha olefins and polyethylene pipe. The SA&S segment manufactures and markets aromatics products, such as benzene, styrene, paraxylene and cyclohexane, as well as polystyrene and styrene-butadiene copolymers. SA&S also manufactures and/or markets a variety of specialty chemical products. Unless otherwise noted, amounts referenced below reflect our net 50 percent interest in CPChem.2014 vs. 2013 Earnings from the Chemicals segment increased $151 million, or 15 percent, in 2014, compared with 2013. The increase in earnings was primarily driven by improved ethylene and polyethylene realized margins due to higher sales prices. Additionally, Chemicals benefited from higher equity earnings from CPChem’s O&P equity affiliates.These increases were partially offset by lower ethylene and polyethylene sales volumes and increased costs related to the Port Arthur facility fire. In addition, impairments of $69 million after-tax in 2014 further offset a portion of the increase to earnings. See the “Business Environment and Executive Overview” section for information on market factors impacting CPChem’s results.In July 2014, a localized fire occurred in the olefins unit at CPChem’s Port Arthur, Texas facility, shutting down ethylene production. The Port Arthur ethylene unit restarted in November. CPChem incurred, on a 100 percent basis, $85 million of associated repair and rebuild costs. Because the Port Arthur ethylene unit was down due to the fire, CPChem experienced a significant reduction in production and sales in several of its product lines stemming from the lack of the Port Arthur ethylene supply. CPChem’s property damage and business interruption insurance coverage limited the potential extent of the financial impact. In the fourth quarter of 2014, CPChem reached an agreement with insurers and recognized into income $120 million related to advanced payments against its business interruption insurance claim.40Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements2013 vs. 2012CPChem continued to benefit from price-advantaged NGL feedstocks in 2013 due to the location of its manufacturing facilities in the U.S. Gulf Coast and Middle East. Earnings from the Chemicals segment increased $163 million, or 20 percent, in 2013, compared with 2012. The increase in earnings was primarily driven by:•Lower costs and interest associated with CPChem’s 2012 early retirement of $1 billion of debt.•Improved polyethylene realized margins.•Higher equity earnings from CPChem’s equity affiliates, reflecting increased volumes and margins.•Lower asset impairments. These increases were partially offset by lower olefins sales volumes related to ethylene outages. In addition, increased turnaround and maintenance activity resulted in lower volumes and higher costs. 41Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsRefining Year Ended December 31 2014 2013 2012 Millions of DollarsNet Income (Loss) Attributable to Phillips 66 Atlantic Basin/Europe$203 27 545Gulf Coast250 59 491Central Corridor942 1,481 2,257Western/Pacific306 44 (385)Other Refining70 136 183Worldwide$1,771 1,747 3,091 Dollars Per BarrelRefining Margins Atlantic Basin/Europe$8.65 6.87 9.28Gulf Coast7.50 6.04 8.29Central Corridor15.26 18.62 26.37Western/Pacific8.22 8.20 11.04Worldwide9.93 9.90 13.35 Thousands of Barrels DailyOperating Statistics Refining operations* Atlantic Basin/Europe Crude oil capacity588 588 588Crude oil processed554 546 555Capacity utilization (percent)94% 93 94Refinery production605 578 599Gulf Coast Crude oil capacity733 733 733Crude oil processed676 651 657Capacity utilization (percent)92% 89 90Refinery production771 736 743Central Corridor Crude oil capacity485 477 470Crude oil processed475 472 454Capacity utilization (percent)98% 99 97Refinery production494 489 471Western/Pacific Crude oil capacity440 440 439Crude oil processed403 410 398Capacity utilization (percent)92% 93 91Refinery production435 445 419Worldwide Crude oil capacity2,246 2,238 2,230Crude oil processed2,108 2,079 2,064Capacity utilization (percent)94% 93 93Refinery production2,305 2,248 2,232*Includes our share of equity affiliates. 42Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsThe Refining segment buys, sells and refines crude oil and other feedstocks into petroleum products (such as gasoline, distillates and aviation fuels) at 14 refineries, mainly in the United States and Europe.2014 vs. 2013 Earnings for the Refining segment were $1,771 million in 2014, an increase of $24 million, or 1 percent, compared with 2013. The slight increase in earnings in 2014 was primarily due to higher realized refining margins related to secondary products, as well as increased volumes. In addition, earnings were impacted by a gain on disposition and a related deferred tax adjustment associated with the sale of MRC, together totaling $369 million after-tax. These increases were mostly offset by: •Lower earnings from decreased gasoline and distillate margins. •Negative impacts due to inventory draws in a declining price environment.•Impairment of the Whitegate Refinery of $131 million after-tax. •Lower interest income received from equity affiliates. See the “Business Environment and Executive Overview” section for information on industry crack spreads and other market factors impacting this year’s results.Our worldwide refining crude oil capacity utilization rate was 94 percent in 2014, compared to 93 percent in 2013. The increase reflects lower unplanned downtime related to power outages that were experienced in the Gulf Coast region in 2013. 2013 vs. 2012 Earnings for the Refining segment were $1,747 million in 2013, a decrease of $1,344 million, or 43 percent, compared with 2012. The decrease in earnings in 2013 was primarily due to lower realized refining margins as a result of a 16 percent reduction in market cracks and impacts related to lower feedstock advantage. In addition to margins, refining results were also impacted by a $104 million after-tax gain from the sale of the Trainer Refinery and associated terminal and pipeline assets in 2012. These decreases were partially offset by reduced impairments recorded in 2012, primarily related to MRC and WRG. Our worldwide refining crude oil capacity utilization rate was 93 percent in both 2013 and 2012, as the lack of weather disruptions were offset by higher turnaround activities. 43Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsMarketing and Specialties Year Ended December 31 2014 2013 2012 Millions of DollarsNet Income Attributable to Phillips 66 Marketing and Other$836 688 275Specialties198 206 269Total Marketing and Specialties$1,034 894 544 Dollars Per BarrelRealized Marketing Fuel Margin* U.S.$1.51 1.21 0.87International5.22 4.36 4.17*On third-party petroleum products sales.

In addition, this segment includes the manufacturing and marketing of specialty products (such as base oils and lubricants), as well as power generation operations. 2014 vs. 2013 Earnings from the M&S segment increased $140 million, or 16 percent, in 2014, compared with 2013. See the “Business Environment and Executive Overview” section for information on marketing fuel margins and other market factors impacting this year’s results.Both U.S. and international marketing margins benefited from the timing effect of falling gasoline prices experienced in the second half of 2014. U.S. marketing also benefited from a full year of consignment agreements entered into in 2013, while international marketing margins also benefited from foreign exchange gains in 2014. In July 2013, we completed the sale of ICHP, and deferred the gain from the sale due to an indemnity provided to the buyer. In 2014, we recognized $126 million after-tax of the previously deferred gain, increasing earnings. These increases were partially offset by the lack of ICHP earnings in 2014, compared with earnings of $53 million in 2013. Looking forward, absent claims under the ICHP indemnity, we expect the remaining deferred gain at December 31, 2014, of $243 million to be recognized in M&S’s earnings in the first and second quarters of 2015. In addition, if the spot prices of gasoline stabilize or begin to increase in 2015, we would expect a reduction in M&S’s margins in 2015, relative to 2014.44Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements2013 vs. 2012Earnings from the M&S segment increased $350 million, or 64 percent, in 2013, compared with 2012. During 2013, U.S. marketing margins benefited from higher Renewable Identification Numbers (RINs) values associated with renewable fuels blending activities, particularly during the first three quarters. RIN prices decreased during the fourth quarter, as concerns over their availability eased somewhat based on anticipated actions by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The increased RIN prices offset weaker underlying components of our U.S. marketing margins during 2013. M&S earnings benefited from higher international marketing margins in 2013, as well as an after-tax gain of $23 million from the sale of our E-GasTM Technology business. Earnings in 2012 were lowered by income taxes associated with foreign dividends, and 2012 included a full year of earnings from our U.K. power generation business, which was sold in July 2013.Corporate and Other Millions of Dollars Year Ended December 31 2014 2013 2012Net Loss Attributable to Phillips 66 Net interest expense$(160) (166) (148)Corporate general and administrative expenses(156) (145) (116)Technology(58) (50) (49)Repositioning costs— — (55)Other(19) (70) (66)Total Corporate and Other$(393) (431) (434)2014 vs. 2013Net interest expense consists of interest and financing expense, net of interest income and capitalized interest. Net interest expense decreased $6 million in 2014, compared with 2013, primarily due to increased capitalized interest. This decrease in expense was partially offset due to an increase in average debt outstanding in 2014, reflecting the issuance of debt in late 2014. For additional information, see Note 14—Debt, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Corporate general and administrative expenses increased $11 million in 2014, compared with 2013. The increase was primarily due to increased employee benefit costs and charitable contributions. The category “Other” includes certain income tax expenses, environmental costs associated with sites no longer in operation, foreign currency transaction gains and losses and other costs not directly associated with an operating segment. The decrease in costs was primarily due to increased utilization of foreign tax credit carryforwards. In addition, our results in 2013 were negatively impacted by higher environmental costs. 45Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements2013 vs. 2012Net interest expense increased $18 million in 2013, compared with 2012, primarily due to increased average debt outstanding in 2013, reflecting the issuance of debt in early 2012 in connection with the Separation. For additional information, see Note 14—Debt, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Corporate general and administrative expenses increased $29 million in 2013, compared with 2012. The increase was primarily due to incremental costs and expenses associated with operating as a stand-alone company. Repositioning costs decreased $55 million in 2013, compared with 2012.

During 2014, cash and cash equivalents decreased by $0.2 billion to $5.2 billion.In addition to cash flows from operating activities, we rely on our commercial paper and credit facility programs, asset sales and our ability to issue securities using our shelf registration statement to support our short- and long-term liquidity requirements. We believe current cash and cash equivalents and cash generated by operations, together with access to external sources of funds as described below under “Significant Sources of Capital,” will be sufficient to meet our funding requirements in the near and long term, including our capital spending, dividend payments, defined benefit plan contributions, debt repayment and share repurchases. Significant Sources of CapitalOperating ActivitiesAlthough net income was higher in 2014 than in 2013, there were large noncash items benefiting 2014 earnings, including the gain on the PSPI exchange, gains from asset dispositions and the deferred tax effects of certain asset dispositions. After consideration of these items, underlying earnings in 2014 were similar to 2013. However, working capital negatively impacted 2014 operating cash flow by $1,020 million, compared with a positive impact of $880 million in 2013. Working capital impacts in 2014 reflected the negative impact of lower commodity prices on accounts payable, with a lesser positive impact on accounts receivable as we generally carry higher payables on our balance sheet than receivables. See the following paragraph for a discussion of 2013 working capital effects. Benefiting 2014 operating cash flow, compared with 2013, was the receipt of a special distribution from WRB, of which $760 million was considered an operating cash flow, partially offset by lower distributions from CPChem.During 2013, cash of $6,027 million was provided by operating activities, a 40 percent increase from cash from operations of $4,296 million in 2012. The increase in 2013 primarily reflected positive working capital impacts. Accounts payable activity increased cash from operations by $360 million in 2013, reflecting both higher volumes and commodity prices. By comparison, lower commodity prices and volumes reduced accounts payable by $985 million in 2012. Our distributions from CPChem increased over $500 million in 2013, compared with 2012, reflecting the completion of CPChem’s debt repayments in 2012, which allowed increased dividends to us and our co-venturer. Partially offsetting the positive impact of working capital changes in 2013 were lower refining margins during 2013, reflecting less favorable market conditions and tightening crude differentials.47Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsOur short- and long-term operating cash flows are highly dependent upon refining and marketing margins, NGL prices, and chemicals margins. Prices and margins in our industry are typically volatile, and are driven by market conditions over which we have little or no control. Absent other mitigating factors, as these prices and margins fluctuate, we would expect a corresponding change in our operating cash flows.The level and quality of output from our refineries also impacts our cash flows. The output at our refineries is impacted by such factors as operating efficiency, maintenance turnarounds, market conditions, feedstock availability and weather conditions. We actively manage the operations of our refineries and, typically, any variability in their operations has not been as significant to cash flows as that caused by margins and prices. Our worldwide refining crude oil capacity utilization was 94 percent in 2014, compared with 93 percent in 2013. We are forecasting 2015 utilization to remain in the low 90-percent range. Our operating cash flows are also impacted by distribution decisions made by our equity affiliates, including DCP Midstream, CPChem and WRB. Over the three years ended December 31, 2014, we received distributions of $654 million from DCP Midstream, $1,948 million from CPChem and $4,220 million from WRB. We cannot control the amount or timing of future distributions from equity affiliates; therefore, future distributions by these and other equity affiliates are not assured. We and our co-venturer in DCP Midstream have agreed to forgo distributions from DCP Midstream during the current low-commodity-price environment.WRBWRB is a 50-percent-owned business venture with Cenovus Energy Inc. (Cenovus). Cenovus was obligated to contribute $7.5 billion, plus accrued interest, to WRB over a 10-year period that began in 2007. In 2014, Cenovus prepaid its remaining balance under this obligation. As a result, WRB declared a special dividend, which was distributed to the co-venturers in 2014. Of the $1,232 million that we received, $760 million was considered a return on our investment in WRB (an operating cash inflow), and $472 million was considered a return of our investment in WRB (an investing cash inflow). The return-of-investment portion of the dividend was included in the “Proceeds from asset dispositions” line in our consolidated statement of cash flows. A further $129 million of distributions from WRB during 2014 was considered a return of investment.Asset SalesProceeds from asset sales in 2014 were $1,244 million, compared with $1,214 million in 2013 and $286 million in 2012. The 2014 proceeds included a portion of the WRB special dividend as discussed above, as well as the sale of our interest in MRC. The 2013 proceeds included the sale of a power plant in the United Kingdom, as well as our gasification technology. The 2012 proceeds included the sale of a refinery and associated terminal and pipeline assets located in Trainer, Pennsylvania, as well as the sale of our Riverhead Terminal located in Riverhead, New York.Phillips 66 Partners LPInitial Public OfferingIn 2013, we formed Phillips 66 Partners LP, a master limited partnership, to own, operate, develop and acquire primarily fee-based crude oil, refined petroleum product and NGL pipelines and terminals, as well as other transportation and midstream assets. On July 26, 2013, Phillips 66 Partners completed its initial public offering (IPO) of 18,888,750 common units at a price of $23.00 per unit, which included a 2,463,750 common unit over-allotment option that was fully exercised by the underwriters. Phillips 66 Partners received $404 million in net proceeds from the sale of the units, after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions, structuring fees and offering expenses. Headquartered in Houston, Texas, Phillips 66 Partners’ assets currently consist of crude oil and refined petroleum product pipeline, terminal, and storage systems in the Central and Gulf Coast regions of the United States, as well as two crude oil rail-unloading facilities, all of which are integral to a connected Phillips 66-operated refinery.Contributions to Phillips 66 Partners LPEffective March 1, 2014, we contributed to Phillips 66 Partners certain transportation, terminaling and storage assets for total consideration of $700 million. These assets consisted of the Gold Line products system and the Medford spheres, two recently constructed refinery-grade propylene storage spheres. Phillips 66 Partners financed the acquisition with cash on hand of $400 million (primarily reflecting its IPO proceeds), the issuance to us of 3,530,595 and 72,053 additional common and general partner units, respectively, valued at $140 million, and a five-year, $160 million note payable to a subsidiary of Phillips 66.48Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsEffective December 1, 2014, we contributed to Phillips 66 Partners certain logistics assets for total consideration of $340 million. These assets consisted of two recently constructed crude oil rail-unloading facilities located at or adjacent to our Bayway and Ferndale refineries, and the Cross Channel Connector pipeline assets located near the partnership’s Pasadena terminal. Phillips 66 Partners financed the acquisition with the borrowing of $28 million under its revolving credit facility, the assumption of a five-year, $244 million note payable to a subsidiary of Phillips 66, and the issuance to Phillips 66 of 1,066,412 common and 21,764 general partner units valued at $68 million.In addition to these two transactions, we made smaller contributions to Phillips 66 Partners of projects under development in the fourth quarter, for consideration in the aggregate of approximately $55 million.OwnershipAt December 31, 2014, we owned a 73 percent limited partner interest and a 2 percent general partner interest in Phillips 66 Partners, while its public unitholders owned a 25 percent limited partner interest. We consolidate Phillips 66 Partners as a variable interest entity for financial reporting purposes. See Note 4—Variable Interest Entities (VIEs), in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information on why we consolidate the partnership. As a result of this consolidation, the public unitholders’ ownership interest in Phillips 66 Partners is reflected as a noncontrolling interest in our financial statements, including $415 million in the equity section of our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2014. Generally, contributions of assets by us to Phillips 66 Partners will eliminate in consolidation, other than third-party debt or equity offerings made by Phillips 66 Partners to finance such transactions. For the 2014 contributions discussed above, the first did not impact our consolidated financial statements, while the second increased consolidated cash and debt by $28 million at the time of the transaction.Recent TransactionsOn February 13, 2015, we entered into a contribution agreement with Phillips 66 Partners under which Phillips 66 Partners will acquire our equity interest in Explorer Pipeline Company (19.46 percent), DCP Sand Hills Pipeline, LLC (33.33 percent), and DCP Southern Hills Pipeline, LLC (33.33 percent). We account for each of these investments under the equity method of accounting. The total consideration for the transaction is expected to be $1,010 million, which will consist of approximately $880 million in cash and the issuance of common units and general partner units to us with an aggregate fair value of $130 million. The transaction is expected to close in early March 2015, subject to standard closing conditions. During February 2015, Phillips 66 Partners initiated two registered public offerings of securities:•5,250,000 common units representing limited partner interests, at a public offering price of $75.50 per unit. The net proceeds at closing are expected to be $384 million, not including an over-allotment option exercisable by the underwriters to purchase up to an additional 787,500 common units.•$1.1 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes, which include $300 million of 2.646% Senior Notes due 2020, $500 million of 3.605% Senior Notes due 2025, and $300 million of 4.680% Senior Notes due 2045.Closings of both public offerings are expected to occur in late February 2015. Phillips 66 Partners expects to use the net proceeds of both offerings to fund the acquisition transaction discussed above, repay existing borrowings from a subsidiary of Phillips 66, fund capital expenditures and for general partnership purposes.Credit Facilities and Commercial PaperDuring the fourth quarter of 2014, we amended our Phillips 66 revolving credit facility, primarily to increase its borrowing capacity from $4.5 billion to $5 billion and to extend the term from June 2018 to December 2019. The Phillips 66 facility may be used for direct bank borrowings, as support for issuances of letters of credit, or as support for our commercial paper program. The facility is with a broad syndicate of financial institutions and contains covenants that we consider usual and customary for an agreement of this type for comparable commercial borrowers, including a maximum consolidated net debt-to-capitalization ratio of 60 percent. The agreement has customary events of default, such as nonpayment of principal when due; nonpayment of interest, fees or other amounts; violation of covenants; cross-payment default and cross-acceleration (in each case, to indebtedness in excess of a threshold amount); and a change of control. Borrowings under the facility will incur interest at the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a margin based on the credit rating of our senior unsecured long-term debt as determined from time to time by Standard & Poor’s 49Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsRatings Services (S&P) and Moody’s Investors Service (Moody’s). The facility also provides for customary fees, including administrative agent fees and commitment fees. As of December 31, 2014, no amount had been directly drawn under this facility and $51 million in letters of credit had been issued that were supported by the facility. As a result, we ended 2014 with $4.9 billion of capacity under this facility.We have a $5 billion commercial paper program for short-term working capital needs. Commercial paper maturities are generally limited to 90 days. As of December 31, 2014, we had no borrowings under our commercial paper program.During the fourth quarter of 2014, Phillips 66 Partners also amended its revolving credit facility, primarily to increase its borrowing capacity from $250 million to $500 million and to extend the term from June 2018 to November 2019. The Phillips 66 Partners facility is with a broad syndicate of financial institutions. As of December 31, 2014, $18 million had been drawn under the facility, leaving $482 million of available capacity.Trade Receivables Securitization FacilityIn 2014, we terminated our $696 million trade receivables securitization facility. No amounts were drawn on this facility throughout its duration, and at the time of termination no letters of credit were outstanding thereunder.Debt FinancingIn November 2014, we issued $2.5 billion of debt consisting of:•$1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 4.650% Senior Notes due 2034.•$1.5 billion aggregate principal amount of 4.875% Senior Notes due 2044.The notes are guaranteed by Phillips 66 Company, a 100-percent-owned subsidiary. Net proceeds received from these offerings will be used to repay $800 million in aggregate principal amount of our outstanding 1.950% Senior Notes due 2015, for capital expenditures, and for general corporate purposes.Our $8.3 billion of outstanding Senior Notes were issued by Phillips 66 and are guaranteed by Phillips 66 Company. Our senior unsecured long-term debt has been rated investment grade by S&P (BBB+) and Moody’s (A3). We do not have any ratings triggers on any of our corporate debt that would cause an automatic default, and thereby impact our access to liquidity, in the event of a downgrade of our credit rating. If our credit rating deteriorated to a level prohibiting us from accessing the commercial paper market, we would expect to be able to access funds under our liquidity facilities mentioned above.Shelf RegistrationWe have a universal shelf registration statement on file with the SEC under which we, as a well-known seasoned issuer, have the ability to issue and sell an indeterminate amount of various types of debt and equity securities.Other FinancingDuring 2014, we recorded capital lease obligations related to equipment and transportation assets. These leases mature within the next fifteen years. During 2013, we entered into a capital lease obligation for use of an oil terminal in the United Kingdom which matures in 2033. The present value of our minimum capital lease payments for these obligations as of December 31, 2014, was $205 million.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsAs part of our normal ongoing business operations, we enter into agreements with other parties to pursue business opportunities, with costs and risks apportioned among the parties as provided by the agreements. In April 2012, in connection with the Separation, we entered into an agreement to guarantee 100 percent of certain outstanding debt obligations of Merey Sweeny, L.P. (MSLP). At December 31, 2014, the aggregate principal amount of MSLP debt guaranteed by us was $189 million.For additional information about guarantees, see Note 15—Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.50Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsCapital RequirementsFor information about our capital expenditures and investments, see “Capital Spending” below.Our debt balance at December 31, 2014, was $8.7 billion and our debt-to-capital ratio was 28 percent, within our target range of 20-to-30 percent.On February 4, 2015, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.50 per common share, payable March 2, 2015, to holders of record at the close of business on February 17, 2015. We are forecasting annual double-digit percentage increases in our dividend rate in 2015 and 2016.During the second half of 2013, we entered into a construction agency agreement and an operating lease agreement with a financial institution for the construction of our new headquarters facility to be located in Houston, Texas. Under the construction agency agreement, we act as construction agent for the financial institution over a construction period of up to three years and eight months, during which time we request cash draws from the financial institution to fund construction costs. Through December 31, 2014, approximately $225 million had been drawn, of which approximately $205 million is recourse to us should certain events of default occur. The operating lease becomes effective after construction is substantially complete and we are able to occupy the facility. The operating lease has a term of five years and provides us the option, at the end of the lease term, to request to renew the lease, purchase the facility, or assist the financial institution in marketing it for resale.During 2012 and 2013, our Board of Directors authorized repurchases totaling up to $5 billion of our outstanding common stock. In July 2014, our Board of Directors authorized additional share repurchases totaling up to $2 billion. The share repurchases are expected to be funded primarily through available cash. The shares will be repurchased from time to time in the open market at the company’s discretion, subject to market conditions and other factors, and in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements and the Tax Sharing Agreement entered into in connection with the Separation. We are not obligated to acquire any particular amount of common stock and may commence, suspend or discontinue purchases at any time or from time to time without prior notice. Since the inception of our share repurchases in 2012, we have repurchased a total of 73,227,369 shares at a cost of $4.9 billion through December 31, 2014. Shares of stock repurchased are held as treasury shares.On October 15, 2014, we signed agreements to form two joint ventures to develop the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) and Energy Transfer Crude Oil Pipeline (ETCOP) projects. We own a 25 percent interest in each joint venture, with our co-venturer holding the remaining 75 percent interest and acting as operator of both the DAPL and ETCOP systems. Our share of construction cost is estimated to be approximately $1.2 billion, which will be reflected as investments in equity-method affiliates. We expect the majority of this capital spending commitment to be incurred in 2015 and 2016, and anticipate it to be funded as part of our overall capital program.51Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsContractual ObligationsThe following table summarizes our aggregate contractual fixed and variable obligations as of December 31, 2014.

We expect these purchase obligations will be fulfilled by operating cash flows in the applicable maturity period. The majority of the purchase obligations are market-based contracts, including exchanges and futures, for the purchase of products such as crude oil and unfractionated NGL. The products are mostly used to supply our refineries and fractionators, optimize the supply chain, and resell to customers. Product purchase commitments with third parties totaled $39,822 million. In addition, $22,117 million are product purchases from CPChem, mostly for natural gas and NGL over the remaining contractual term of 85 years, and $8,575 million from Excel Paralubes, for base oil over the remaining contractual term of 10 years.Purchase obligations of $6,385 million are related to agreements to access and utilize the capacity of third-party equipment and facilities, including pipelines and product terminals, to transport, process, treat, and store products. The remainder is primarily our net share of purchase commitments for materials and services for jointly owned facilities where we are the operator.(c)Excludes pensions. For the 2015 through 2019 time period, we expect to contribute an average of $138 million per year to our qualified and nonqualified pension and other postretirement benefit plans in the United States and an average of $56 million per year to our non-U.S. plans, which are expected to be in excess of required minimums in many cases. The U.S. five-year average consists of $30 million for 2015 and then approximately $165 million per year for the remaining four years. Our minimum funding in 2015 is expected to be $30 million in the United States and $70 million outside the United States.(d)Excludes unrecognized tax benefits of $134 million because the ultimate disposition and timing of any payments to be made with regard to such amounts are not reasonably estimable or the amounts relate to potential refunds. Also excludes interest and penalties of $16 million. Although unrecognized tax benefits are not a contractual obligation, they are presented in this table because they represent potential demands on our liquidity.52Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsCapital Spending Millions of Dollars 2015Budget 2014 2013 2012Capital Expenditures and Investments Midstream*$3,163 2,173 597 707Chemicals— — — —Refining**1,112 1,038 820 735Marketing and Specialties170 439 226 119Corporate and Other**155 123 136 140Total consolidated from continuing operations$4,600 3,773 1,779 1,701 Discontinued operations$— — 27 20 Selected Equity Affiliates*** DCP Midstream*$400 776 971 1,324CPChem1,453 897 613 371WRB203 140 109 136 $2,056 1,813 1,693 1,831*2012 consolidated amount includes acquisition of a one-third interest in the Sand Hills and Southern Hills pipeline projects from DCP Midstream for $459 million. This amount was also included in DCP Midstream’s capital spending, primarily in 2012. **2015 budget includes non-cash capitalized leases of $11 million in Refining and $21 million in Corporate and Other.***Our share of capital spending, which has been self-funded by the equity affiliate and is expected to be in 2015.MidstreamDuring the three-year period ended December 31, 2014, DCP Midstream had a self-funded capital program, and thus required no new capital infusions from us or our co-venturer, Spectra Energy Corp. During this three-year period, on a 100 percent basis, DCP Midstream’s capital expenditures and investments were $6.1 billion. In 2012, we invested approximately $0.5 billion in total to acquire a one-third direct interest in DCP Sand Hills Pipeline, LLC (DCP Sand Hills) and DCP Southern Hills Pipeline, LLC (DCP Southern Hills). Phillips 66, Spectra Energy Partners and DCP Midstream Partners each own a one-third interest in each of the two pipeline entities, and both pipelines are operated by DCP Midstream. In 2013 and 2014, we made additional investments in both DCP Sand Hills and DCP Southern Hills, increasing our total direct investment to $0.8 billion.Other capital spending in our Midstream segment not related to DCP Midstream or the Sand Hills and Southern Hills pipelines over the three-year period included construction activities in 2014 related to our Sweeny Fractionator One and Freeport LPG Export Terminal projects, our acquisition in 2014 of a 7.1 million-barrel-storage-capacity crude oil and petroleum products terminal located near Beaumont, Texas, the purchase in 2014 of an additional 5.7 percent interest in the refined products Explorer Pipeline, and spending associated with return, reliability and maintenance projects. In addition to our Sweeny Fractionator One and Freeport LPG Export Terminal projects, our major capital activities in 2013 and 2014 included the construction of rail racks to accept advantaged crude deliveries at our Bayway and Ferndale refineries.ChemicalsDuring the three-year period ended December 31, 2014, CPChem had a self-funded capital program, and thus required no new capital infusions from us or our co-venturer, Chevron U.S.A. Inc. (Chevron), an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Chevron Corporation. During the three-year period, on a 100 percent basis, CPChem’s capital expenditures and investments were $3.8 billion. In addition, CPChem’s advances to equity affiliates, primarily used for project construction and start-up activities, were $0.5 billion and its repayments received from equity affiliates were $0.4 billion.53Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsRefiningCapital spending for the Refining segment during the three-year period ended December 31, 2014, was $2.6 billion, primarily for air emission reduction and clean fuels projects to meet new environmental standards, refinery upgrade projects to increase accessibility of advantaged crudes and improve product yields, improvements to the operating integrity of key processing units, and safety-related projects.Key projects completed during the three-year period included: •Installation of facilities to reduce nitrous oxide emissions from the crude furnace and installation of a new high-efficiency vacuum furnace at Bayway Refinery.•Completion of gasoline benzene reduction projects at the Alliance, Bayway, and Ponca City refineries.•Installation of new coke drums at the Billings and Ponca City refineries.•Installation of a new waste heat boiler at the Bayway Refinery to reduce carbon monoxide emissions while providing steam production.Major construction activities in progress include: •Installation of facilities to reduce nitrous oxide emissions from the fluid catalytic cracker at the Alliance Refinery.•Installation of a tail gas treating unit at the Humber Refinery to reduce emissions from the sulfur recovery units.Generally, our equity affiliates in the Refining segment are intended to have self-funding capital programs. During this three-year period, on a 100 percent basis, WRB’s capital expenditures and investments were $0.8 billion. We expect WRB’s 2015 capital program to be self-funding.Marketing and SpecialtiesCapital spending for the M&S segment during the three-year period ended December 31, 2014, was primarily for the acquisition of, and investments in, a limited number of retail sites in the Western and Midwestern portions of the United States; the acquisition of Spectrum Corporation, a private label specialty lubricants business headquartered in Memphis, Tennessee, as well as the remaining interest that we did not already own in an entity that operates a power and steam generation plant; reliability and maintenance projects; and projects targeted at growing our international marketing business.Corporate and OtherCapital spending for Corporate and Other during the three-year period ended December 31, 2014, was primarily for projects related to information technology and facilities.2015 BudgetOur 2015 capital budget is $4.6 billion. This excludes our portion of planned capital spending by joint ventures DCP Midstream, CPChem and WRB totaling $2.1 billion, all of which are expected to be self-funded. We continually evaluate our capital budget in light of market conditions. As part of our disciplined approach to capital allocation, we retain the flexibility to adjust the capital budget as the year progresses.In Midstream, we plan to invest $3.2 billion in our NGL and Transportation business lines. Midstream capital includes approximately $0.2 billion expected to be spent by Phillips 66 Partners to support organic growth projects. In NGL, construction of the 100,000 barrel-per-day Sweeny Fractionator One and the 4.4 million-barrel-per-month Freeport LPG Export Terminal on the U.S. Gulf Coast continues. In Transportation, we are investing in pipeline and rail infrastructure projects to move crude oil from the Bakken/Three Forks production area of North Dakota to market centers throughout the United States. In addition, expansion of the Beaumont Terminal and related infrastructure opportunities are being pursued. We plan to spend $1.1 billion of capital in Refining, approximately 75 percent of which will be sustaining capital. These investments are related to reliability and maintenance, safety and environmental projects, including compliance with the 54Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statementsnew EPA Tier 3 gasoline specifications. Discretionary Refining capital investments are expected to be directed toward small, high-return, quick pay-out projects, primarily to enhance the use of advantaged crudes and improve product yields.In Marketing and Specialties, we plan to invest approximately $0.2 billion for growth and sustaining capital. The growth investment reflects our continued plans to expand and enhance our fuel marketing business.In Corporate and Other, we plan to fund approximately $0.2 billion in projects primarily related to information technology and facilities.ContingenciesA number of lawsuits involving a variety of claims have been brought against us in connection with matters that arise in the ordinary course of business. We also may be required to remove or mitigate the effects on the environment of the placement, storage, disposal or release of certain chemical, mineral and petroleum substances at various active and inactive sites. We regularly assess the need for accounting recognition or disclosure of these contingencies. In the case of all known contingencies (other than those related to income taxes), we accrue a liability when the loss is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable. If a range of amounts can be reasonably estimated and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount, then the minimum of the range is accrued. We do not reduce these liabilities for potential insurance or third-party recoveries. If applicable, we accrue receivables for probable insurance or other third-party recoveries. In the case of income-tax-related contingencies, we use a cumulative probability-weighted loss accrual in cases where sustaining a tax position is less than certain.Based on currently available information, we believe it is remote that future costs related to known contingent liability exposures will exceed current accruals by an amount that would have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements. As we learn new facts concerning contingencies, we reassess our position both with respect to accrued liabilities and other potential exposures. Estimates particularly sensitive to future changes include contingent liabilities recorded for environmental remediation, tax and legal matters. Estimated future environmental remediation costs are subject to change due to such factors as the uncertain magnitude of cleanup costs, the unknown time and extent of such remedial actions that may be required, and the determination of our liability in proportion to that of other potentially responsible parties. Estimated future costs related to tax and legal matters are subject to change as events evolve and as additional information becomes available during the administrative and litigation processes.Legal and Tax MattersOur legal organization applies its knowledge, experience and professional judgment to the specific characteristics of our cases, employing a litigation management process to manage and monitor the legal proceedings against us. Our process facilitates the early evaluation and quantification of potential exposures in individual cases. This process also enables us to track those cases that have been scheduled for trial and/or mediation. Based on professional judgment and experience in using these litigation management tools and available information about current developments in all our cases, our legal organization regularly assesses the adequacy of current accruals and determines if adjustment of existing accruals, or establishment of new accruals, are required. See Note 22—Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information about income-tax-related contingencies.EnvironmentalWe are subject to the same numerous international, federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations as other companies in our industry. The most significant of these environmental laws and regulations include, among others, the: •U.S. Federal Clean Air Act, which governs air emissions.•U.S. Federal Clean Water Act, which governs discharges to water bodies.•European Union Regulation for Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH), which governs the manufacture, placing on the market or use of chemicals.•U.S. Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), which imposes liability on generators, transporters and arrangers of hazardous substances at sites where hazardous substance releases have occurred or are threatening to occur.•U.S. Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), which governs the treatment, storage and disposal of solid waste.55Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements•U.S. Federal Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA), which requires facilities to report toxic chemical inventories to local emergency planning committees and response departments.•U.S. Federal Safe Drinking Water Act, which governs the disposal of wastewater in underground injection wells.•U.S. Federal Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA90), under which owners and operators of onshore facilities and pipelines, lessees or permittees of an area in which an offshore facility is located, and owners and operators of vessels are liable for removal costs and damages that result from a discharge of oil into navigable waters of the United States.•European Union Trading Directive resulting in the European Emissions Trading Scheme, which uses a market-based mechanism to incentivize the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.These laws and their implementing regulations set limits on emissions and, in the case of discharges to water, establish water quality limits. They also, in most cases, require permits in association with new or modified operations. These permits can require an applicant to collect substantial information in connection with the application process, which can be expensive and time consuming. In addition, there can be delays associated with notice and comment periods and the agency’s processing of the application. Many of the delays associated with the permitting process are beyond the control of the applicant.Many states and foreign countries where we operate also have, or are developing, similar environmental laws and regulations governing these same types of activities. While similar, in some cases these regulations may impose additional, or more stringent, requirements that can add to the cost and difficulty of marketing or transporting products across state and international borders.The ultimate financial impact arising from environmental laws and regulations is neither clearly known nor easily determinable as new standards, such as air emission standards, water quality standards and stricter fuel regulations, continue to evolve. However, environmental laws and regulations, including those that may arise to address concerns about global climate change, are expected to continue to have an increasing impact on our operations in the United States and in other countries in which we operate. Notable areas of potential impacts include air emission compliance and remediation obligations in the United States.An example in the fuels area is the Energy Policy Act of 2005, which imposed obligations to provide increasing volumes of renewable fuels in transportation motor fuels through 2012. These obligations were changed with the enactment of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA). EISA requires fuel producers and importers to provide additional renewable fuels for transportation motor fuels and stipulates a mix of various types to be included through 2022. We have met the increasingly stringent requirements to date while establishing implementation, operating and capital strategies, along with advanced technology development, to address projected future requirements. It is uncertain how various future requirements contained in EISA, and the regulations promulgated thereunder, may be implemented and what their full impact may be on our operations. Also, we may experience a decrease in demand for refined petroleum products due to the regulatory program as currently promulgated. For the 2014 compliance year, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposed to reduce the statutory volumes of advanced and total renewable fuel using authority granted to it under EISA. We do not know whether this reduction will be finalized as proposed or whether the EPA will utilize its authority to reduce statutory volumes in future compliance years.We also are subject to certain laws and regulations relating to environmental remediation obligations associated with current and past operations. Such laws and regulations include CERCLA and RCRA and their state equivalents. Remediation obligations include cleanup responsibility arising from petroleum releases from underground storage tanks located at numerous past and present owned and/or operated petroleum-marketing outlets throughout the United States. Federal and state laws require contamination caused by such underground storage tank releases be assessed and remediated to meet applicable standards. In addition to other cleanup standards, many states have adopted cleanup criteria for methyl tertiary-butyl ether (MTBE) for both soil and groundwater.At RCRA-permitted facilities, we are required to assess environmental conditions. If conditions warrant, we may be required to remediate contamination caused by prior operations. In contrast to CERCLA, which is often referred to as “Superfund,” the cost of corrective action activities under RCRA corrective action programs typically is borne solely by us. We anticipate increased expenditures for RCRA remediation activities may be required, but such annual expenditures for the near term are not expected to vary significantly from the range of such expenditures we have experienced over the past few years. Longer-term expenditures are subject to considerable uncertainty and may fluctuate significantly.56Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsWe occasionally receive requests for information or notices of potential liability from the EPA and state environmental agencies alleging we are a potentially responsible party under CERCLA or an equivalent state statute. On occasion, we also have been made a party to cost recovery litigation by those agencies or by private parties. These requests, notices and lawsuits assert potential liability for remediation costs at various sites that typically are not owned by us, but allegedly contain wastes attributable to our past operations. As of December 31, 2013, we reported we had been notified of potential liability under CERCLA and comparable state laws at 35 sites around the United States. During 2014, there were no new sites for which we received notification of potential liability and one site was deemed resolved and closed, leaving 34 unresolved sites with potential liability at December 31, 2014. For most Superfund sites, our potential liability will be significantly less than the total site remediation costs because the percentage of waste attributable to us, versus that attributable to all other potentially responsible parties, is relatively low. Although liability of those potentially responsible is generally joint and several for federal sites and frequently so for state sites, other potentially responsible parties at sites where we are a party typically have had the financial strength to meet their obligations, and where they have not, or where potentially responsible parties could not be located, our share of liability has not increased materially. Many of the sites for which we are potentially responsible are still under investigation by the EPA or the state agencies concerned. Prior to actual cleanup, those potentially responsible normally assess site conditions, apportion responsibility and determine the appropriate remediation. In some instances, we may have no liability or attain a settlement of liability. Actual cleanup costs generally occur after the parties obtain EPA or equivalent state agency approval of a remediation plan. There are relatively few sites where we are a major participant, and given the timing and amounts of anticipated expenditures, neither the cost of remediation at those sites nor such costs at all CERCLA sites, in the aggregate, is expected to have a material adverse effect on our competitive or financial condition.Expensed environmental costs were $630 million in 2014 and are expected to be approximately $680 million in each of 2015 and 2016. Capitalized environmental costs were $411 million in 2014 and are expected to be approximately $320 million in each of 2015 and 2016. This amount does not include capital expenditures made for another purpose that have an indirect benefit on environmental compliance.Accrued liabilities for remediation activities are not reduced for potential recoveries from insurers or other third parties and are not discounted (except those assumed in a purchase business combination, which we record on a discounted basis).Many of these liabilities result from CERCLA, RCRA and similar state laws that require us to undertake certain investigative and remedial activities at sites where we conduct, or once conducted, operations or at sites where our generated waste was disposed. We also have accrued for a number of sites we identified that may require environmental remediation, but which are not currently the subject of CERCLA, RCRA or state enforcement activities. If applicable, we accrue receivables for probable insurance or other third-party recoveries. In the future, we may incur significant costs under both CERCLA and RCRA. Remediation activities vary substantially in duration and cost from site to site, depending on the mix of unique site characteristics, evolving remediation technologies, diverse regulatory agencies and enforcement policies, and the presence or absence of potentially liable third parties. Therefore, it is difficult to develop reasonable estimates of future site remediation costs.At December 31, 2014, our balance sheet included total accrued environmental costs of $496 million, compared with $492 million at December 31, 2013, and $530 million at December 31, 2012. We expect to incur a substantial amount of these expenditures within the next 30 years.Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, and as with other companies engaged in similar businesses, environmental costs and liabilities are inherent concerns in our operations and products, and there can be no assurance that material costs and liabilities will not be incurred. However, we currently do not expect any material adverse effect upon our results of operations or financial position as a result of compliance with current environmental laws and regulations.The EPA’s Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) program was implemented in accordance with the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and EISA. The RFS program sets annual quotas for the percentage of biofuels (such as ethanol) that must be blended into motor fuels consumed in the United States. A Renewable Identification Number (RIN) represents a serial number assigned to each gallon of biofuel produced or imported into the United States. As a producer of petroleum-based motor fuels, we are obligated to blend biofuels into the products we produce at a rate that is at least equal to the EPA’s quota and, to the extent we do not, we must purchase RINs in the open market to satisfy our obligation under the RFS program. The market for RINs has been the subject of fraudulent activity, and we have identified that we have unknowingly 57Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statementspurchased RINs in the past that were invalid due to fraudulent activity of third parties. Although costs to replace fraudulently marketed RINs that have been determined to be invalid have not been material through December 31, 2014, it is reasonably possible that some additional RINs that we have previously purchased may also be determined to be invalid. Should that occur, we could incur additional replacement charges. Although the cost for replacing any additional fraudulently marketed RINs is not reasonably estimable at this time, we could have a possible exposure of approximately $150 million before tax. It could take several years for this possible exposure to reach ultimate resolution; therefore, we would not expect to incur the full financial impact of additional fraudulent RINs replacement costs in any single interim or annual period.Climate ChangeThere has been a broad range of proposed or promulgated state, national and international laws focusing on greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction. These proposed or promulgated laws apply or could apply in countries where we have interests or may have interests in the future. Laws in this field continue to evolve, and while it is not possible to accurately estimate either a timetable for implementation or our future compliance costs relating to implementation, such laws, if enacted, could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition. Examples of legislation or precursors for possible regulation that do or could affect our operations include: •European Union Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS), which is part of the European Union’s policy to combat climate change and is a key tool for reducing industrial greenhouse gas emissions. EU ETS impacts factories, power stations and other installations across all EU member states. •California’s Global Warming Solutions Act, which requires the California Air Resources Board to develop regulations and market mechanisms that will target reduction of California’s GHG emissions by 25 percent by 2020.•The U.S. Supreme Court decision in Massachusetts v. EPA, 549 U.S. 497, 127 S. Ct. 1438 (2007), confirming that the EPA has the authority to regulate carbon dioxide as an “air pollutant” under the Federal Clean Air Act.•The EPA’s announcement on March 29, 2010 (published as “Interpretation of Regulations that Determine Pollutants Covered by Clean Air Act Permitting Programs,” 75 Fed. Reg. 17004 (April 2, 2010)), and the EPA’s and U.S. Department of Transportation’s joint promulgation of a Final Rule on April 1, 2010, that triggers regulation of GHGs under the Clean Air Act. These collectively may lead to more climate-based claims for damages, and may result in longer agency review time for development projects to determine the extent of potential climate change. •Carbon taxes in certain jurisdictions.•GHG emission cap and trade programs in certain jurisdictions.In the EU, the first phase of the EU ETS completed at the end of 2007 and Phase II was undertaken from 2008 through to 2012. The current phase (Phase III) runs from 2013 through to 2020, with the main changes being reduced allocation of free allowances and increased auctioning of new allowances. Phillips 66 has assets that are subject to the EU ETS, and the company is actively engaged in minimizing any financial impact from the EU ETS.In the United States, some additional form of regulation may be forthcoming in the future at the federal or state levels with respect to GHG emissions. Such regulation could take any of several forms that may result in the creation of additional costs in the form of taxes, the restriction of output, investments of capital to maintain compliance with laws and regulations, or required acquisition or trading of emission allowances. We are working to continuously improve operational and energy efficiency through resource and energy conservation throughout our operations.Compliance with changes in laws and regulations that create a GHG emission trading program or GHG reduction requirements could significantly increase our costs, reduce demand for fossil energy derived products, impact the cost and availability of capital and increase our exposure to litigation. Such laws and regulations could also increase demand for less carbon intensive energy sources. An example of one such program is California’s cap and trade program, which was promulgated pursuant to the State’s Global Warming Solutions Act. The program has been limited to certain stationary sources, which include our refineries in California, but beginning in January 2015 expanded to include emissions from transportation fuels distributed in California. We expect inclusion of transportation fuels in California’s cap and trade program as currently promulgated will increase our cap and trade program compliance costs. The ultimate impact on our financial performance, either positive or negative, from this and similar programs, will depend on a number of factors, including, but not limited to:58Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements •Whether and to what extent legislation or regulation is enacted.•The nature of the legislation or regulation (such as a cap and trade system or a tax on emissions).•The GHG reductions required.•The price and availability of offsets.•The amount and allocation of allowances.•Technological and scientific developments leading to new products or services.•Any potential significant physical effects of climate change (such as increased severe weather events, changes in sea levels and changes in temperature).•Whether, and the extent to which, increased compliance costs are ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services.CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATESThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to select appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. See Note 2—Accounting Policies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for descriptions of our major accounting policies. Certain of these accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent that there is a reasonable likelihood that materially different amounts would have been reported under different conditions, or if different assumptions had been used. The following discussion of critical accounting estimates, along with the discussion of contingencies in this report, address all important accounting areas where the nature of accounting estimates or assumptions could be material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change.ImpairmentsLong-lived assets used in operations are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate a possible significant deterioration in future cash flows is expected to be generated by an asset group. If, upon review, the sum of the undiscounted pre-tax cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset group, including applicable liabilities, the carrying value of the long-lived assets included in the asset group is written down to estimated fair value. Individual assets are grouped for impairment purposes based on a judgmental assessment of the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets (for example, at a refinery complex level). Because there usually is a lack of quoted market prices for long-lived assets, the fair value of impaired assets is typically determined using one or more of the following methods: the present values of expected future cash flows using discount rates and other assumptions believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants; a market multiple of earnings for similar assets; or historical market transactions of similar assets, adjusted using principal market participant assumptions when necessary. The expected future cash flows used for impairment reviews and related fair value calculations are based on judgmental assessments of future volumes, commodity prices, operating costs, margins, discount rates and capital project decisions, considering all available information at the date of review.Investments in nonconsolidated entities accounted for under the equity method are reviewed for impairment when there is evidence of a loss in value. Such evidence of a loss in value might include our inability to recover the carrying amount, the lack of sustained earnings capacity which would justify the current investment amount, or a current fair value less than the investment’s carrying amount. When it is determined such a loss in value is other than temporary, an impairment charge is recognized for the difference between the investment’s carrying value and its estimated fair value. When determining whether a decline in value is other than temporary, management considers factors such as the length of time and extent of the decline, the investee’s financial condition and near-term prospects, and our ability and intention to retain our investment for a period that will be sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in the market value of the investment. When quoted market prices are not available, the fair value is usually based on the present value of expected future cash flows using discount rates and other assumptions believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants and a market analysis of comparable assets, if appropriate. Differing assumptions could affect the timing and the amount of an impairment of an investment in any period.59Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsAsset Retirement ObligationsUnder various contracts, permits and regulations, we have legal obligations to remove tangible equipment and restore the land at the end of operations at certain operational sites. Our largest asset removal obligations involve asbestos abatement at refineries. Estimating the timing and amount of payments for future asset removal costs is difficult. Most of these removal obligations are many years, or decades, in the future, and the contracts and regulations often have vague descriptions of what removal practices and criteria must be met when the removal event actually occurs. Asset removal technologies and costs, regulatory and other compliance considerations, expenditure timing, and other inputs into valuation of the obligation, including discount and inflation rates, are also subject to change.Environmental CostsIn addition to asset retirement obligations discussed above, under the above or similar contracts, permits and regulations, we have certain obligations to complete environmental-related projects. These projects are primarily related to cleanup at domestic refineries, underground storage sites and non-operated sites. Future environmental remediation costs are difficult to estimate because they are subject to change due to such factors as the uncertain magnitude of cleanup costs, the unknown time and extent of such remedial actions that may be required, and the determination of our liability in proportion to that of other responsible parties.Intangible Assets and GoodwillAt December 31, 2014, we had $756 million of intangible assets determined to have indefinite useful lives, and thus they are not amortized. This judgmental assessment of an indefinite useful life must be continuously evaluated in the future. If, due to changes in facts and circumstances, management determines these intangible assets have finite useful lives, amortization will commence at that time on a prospective basis. As long as these intangible assets are judged to have indefinite lives, they will be subject to annual impairment tests that require management’s judgment of the estimated fair value of these intangible assets.At December 31, 2014, we had $3.3 billion of goodwill recorded in conjunction with past business combinations. Goodwill is not amortized. Instead, goodwill is subject to at least annual reviews for impairment at a reporting unit level. The reporting unit or units used to evaluate and measure goodwill for impairment are determined primarily from the manner in which the business is managed. A reporting unit is an operating segment or a component that is one level below an operating segment.Effective January 1, 2014, we reallocated $52 million of goodwill from the Refining segment to the M&S segment based upon the realignment of certain assets between the reporting units. Goodwill was reassigned to the reporting units using a relative fair value approach. Goodwill impairment testing was completed and no impairment recognition was required. See Note 27—Segment Disclosures and Related Information, for additional information on this segment realignment. Sales or dispositions of significant assets within a reporting unit are allocated a portion of that reporting unit’s goodwill, based on relative fair values, which adjusts the amount of gain or loss on the sale or disposition.Because quoted market prices for our reporting units were not available, management applied judgment in determining the estimated fair values of the reporting units for purposes of performing the goodwill impairment test. Management used all available information to make this fair value determination, including observed market earnings multiples of comparable companies, our common stock price and associated total company market capitalization and the present values of expected future cash flows using discount rates commensurate with the risks involved in the assets.We completed our annual impairment test, as of October 1, 2014, and concluded that the fair value of our reporting units exceeded their recorded net book values (including goodwill). Our Refining reporting unit had a percentage excess of fair value over recorded net book value of approximately 60 percent. Our Transportation and M&S reporting unit’s fair values exceeded their recorded net book values by over 100 percent. However, a decline in the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting units in the future could result in an impairment. For example, a prolonged or significant decline in our stock price or a significant decline in actual or forecasted earnings could provide evidence of a significant decline in fair value and a need to record a material impairment of goodwill for one or more of our reporting units.60Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsTax Assets and LiabilitiesOur operations are subject to various taxes, including federal, state and foreign income taxes and transactional taxes such as excise, sales/use, property and payroll taxes. We record tax liabilities based on our assessment of existing tax laws and regulations. The recording of tax liabilities requires significant judgment and estimates. We recognize the financial statement effects of an income tax position when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination by a taxing authority. A contingent liability related to a transactional tax claim is recorded if the loss is both probable and estimable. Actual incurred tax liabilities can vary from our estimates for a variety of reasons, including different interpretations of tax laws and regulations and different assessments of the amount of tax due.In determining our income tax provision, we assess the likelihood our deferred tax assets will be recovered through future taxable income. Valuation allowances reduce deferred tax assets to an amount that will, more likely than not, be realized. Judgment is required in estimating the amount of valuation allowance, if any, that should be recorded against our deferred tax assets. Based on our historical taxable income, our expectations for the future, and available tax-planning strategies, we expect the net deferred tax assets will more likely than not be realized as offsets to reversing deferred tax liabilities and as reductions to future taxable income. If our actual results of operations differ from such estimates or our estimates of future taxable income change, the valuation allowance may need to be revised.New tax laws and regulations, as well as changes to existing tax laws and regulations, are continuously being proposed or promulgated. The implementation of future legislative and regulatory tax initiatives could result in increased tax liabilities that cannot be predicted at this time.Projected Benefit Obligations Determination of the projected benefit obligations for our defined benefit pension and postretirement plans are important to the recorded amounts for such obligations on the balance sheet and to the amount of benefit expense in the income statement. The actuarial determination of projected benefit obligations and company contribution requirements involves judgment about uncertain future events, including estimated retirement dates, salary levels at retirement, mortality rates, lump-sum election rates, rates of return on plan assets, future health care cost-trend rates, and rates of utilization of health care services by retirees. Due to the specialized nature of these calculations, we engage outside actuarial firms to assist in the determination of these projected benefit obligations and company contribution requirements. Due to differing objectives and requirements between financial accounting rules and the pension plan funding regulations promulgated by governmental agencies, the actuarial methods and assumptions for the two purposes differ in certain important respects. Ultimately, we will be required to fund all promised benefits under pension and postretirement benefit plans not funded by plan assets or investment returns, but the judgmental assumptions used in the actuarial calculations significantly affect periodic financial statements and funding patterns over time. Benefit expense is particularly sensitive to the discount rate and return on plan assets assumptions. A 1 percent decrease in the discount rate assumption would increase annual benefit expense by an estimated $80 million, while a 1 percent decrease in the return on plan assets assumption would increase annual benefit expense by an estimated $30 million. In determining the discount rate, we use yields on high-quality fixed income investments with payments matched to the estimated distributions of benefits from our plans.In 2014 and 2013, the company used an expected long-term rate of return of 7 percent for the U.S. pension plan assets, which account for 75 percent of the company’s pension plan assets. The actual asset returns for 2014 and 2013 were 9 percent and 16 percent, respectively. For the eight years prior to the Separation, actual asset returns averaged 7 percent for the U.S. pension plan assets. The 2013 asset returns of 16 percent were associated with a broad recovery in the financial markets during the year.NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDSIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606).” The new standard converged guidance on recognizing revenues in contracts with customers under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and International Financial Reporting Standards. This ASU is intended to improve comparability of revenue recognition practices across entities, industries, jurisdictions and capital markets. ASU 2014-09 is effective for annual and quarterly reporting periods of public entities beginning after December 15, 2016. Early application for public entities is not permitted. We are currently evaluating the provisions of ASU 2014-09 and assessing the impact, if any, it may have on our financial position and results of operations.61Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsItem 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKFinancial Instrument Market RiskWe and certain of our subsidiaries hold and issue derivative contracts and financial instruments that expose our cash flows or earnings to changes in commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates. We may use financial- and commodity-based derivative contracts to manage the risks produced by changes in the prices of crude oil and related products, natural gas, NGL, and electric power; fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates; or to capture market opportunities.Our use of derivative instruments is governed by an “Authority Limitations” document approved by our Board of Directors that prohibits the use of highly leveraged derivatives or derivative instruments without sufficient market liquidity for comparable valuations. The Authority Limitations document also establishes the Value at Risk (VaR) limits for us, and compliance with these limits is monitored daily. Our Chief Financial Officer monitors risks resulting from foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. Our President monitors commodity price risk. The Commercial organization manages our commercial marketing, optimizes our commodity flows and positions, and monitors related risks of our businesses.Commodity Price RiskWe sell into or receive supply from the worldwide crude oil, refined products, natural gas, NGL, and electric power markets and are exposed to fluctuations in the prices for these commodities.These fluctuations can affect our revenues and purchases, as well as the cost of operating, investing and financing activities. Generally, our policy is to remain exposed to the market prices of commodities.Our Commercial organization uses futures, forwards, swaps and options in various markets to optimize the value of our supply chain, which may move our risk profile away from market average prices to accomplish the following objectives: •Balance physical systems. In addition to cash settlement prior to contract expiration, exchange-traded futures contracts also may be settled by physical delivery of the commodity, providing another source of supply to meet our refinery requirements or marketing demand.•Meet customer needs. Consistent with our policy to generally remain exposed to market prices, we use swap contracts to convert fixed-price sales contracts, which are often requested by refined product consumers, to a floating-market price.•Manage the risk to our cash flows from price exposures on specific crude oil, refined product, natural gas, and electric power transactions.•Enable us to use the market knowledge gained from these activities to capture market opportunities such as moving physical commodities to more profitable locations, storing commodities to capture seasonal or time premiums, and blending commodities to capture quality upgrades. Derivatives may be utilized to optimize these activities.We use a VaR model to estimate the loss in fair value that could potentially result on a single day from the effect of adverse changes in market conditions on the derivative financial instruments and derivative commodity instruments held or issued, including commodity purchase and sales contracts recorded on the balance sheet at December 31, 2014, as derivative instruments. Using Monte Carlo simulation, a 95 percent confidence level and a one-day holding period, the VaR for those instruments issued or held for trading purposes at December 31, 2014 and 2013, was immaterial to our cash flows and net income.The VaR for instruments held for purposes other than trading at December 31, 2014 and 2013, was also immaterial to our cash flows and net income.62Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsInterest Rate RiskThe following tables provide information about our debt instruments that are sensitive to changes in U.S. interest rates. These tables present principal cash flows and related weighted-average interest rates by expected maturity dates. Weighted-average variable rates are based on effective rates at the reporting date. The carrying amount of our floating-rate debt approximates its fair value. The fair value of the fixed-rate financial instruments is estimated based on quoted market prices.

You can identify our forward-looking statements by the words “anticipate,” “estimate,” “believe,” “budget,” “continue,” “could,” “intend,” “may,” “plan,” “potential,” “predict,” “seek,” “should,” “will,” “would,” “expect,” “objective,” “projection,” “forecast,” “goal,” “guidance,” “outlook,” “effort,” “target” and similar expressions.We based the forward-looking statements on our current expectations, estimates and projections about us and the industries in which we operate in general. We caution you these statements are not guarantees of future performance as they involve assumptions that, while made in good faith, may prove to be incorrect, and involve risks and uncertainties we cannot predict. In addition, we based many of these forward-looking statements on assumptions about future events that may prove to be inaccurate. Accordingly, our actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what we have expressed or forecast in the forward-looking statements.

At December 31, 2015, we had total assets of $48.6 billion.Executive OverviewWe reported earnings of $4.2 billion in 2015 and generated $5.7 billion in cash from operating activities. Phillips 66 Partners LP issued $1.1 billion of debt and $384 million of its common units to the public. We used available cash primarily to fund capital expenditures and investments of $5.8 billion, pay dividends of $1.2 billion, repurchase $1.5 billion of our common stock, and repay $800 million of senior notes that came due in 2015. We ended 2015 with $3.1 billion of cash and cash equivalents and approximately $4.9 billion of total capacity under our available liquidity facilities. Our financial performance in 2015 demonstrated the benefit of a diversified portfolio of businesses in a low commodity price environment. We continue to focus on the following strategic priorities:•Operating Excellence. Our commitment to operating excellence guides everything we do. We are committed to protecting the health and safety of everyone who has a role in our operations and the communities in which we operate. Continuous improvement in safety, environmental stewardship, reliability and cost efficiency is a fundamental requirement for our company and employees. We employ rigorous training and audit programs to drive ongoing improvement in both personal and process safety as we strive for zero incidents. Since we cannot control commodity prices, controlling operating expenses and overhead costs, within the context of our commitment to safety and environmental stewardship, is a high priority. We actively monitor these costs using various methodologies that are reported to senior management. We are committed to protecting the environment and strive to reduce our environmental footprint throughout our operations. Optimizing utilization rates at our refineries through reliable and safe operations enables us to capture the value available in the market in terms of prices and margins. During 2015, our worldwide refining crude oil capacity utilization rate was 91 percent.•Growth. We have budgeted $3.9 billion in capital expenditures and investments in 2016, including $0.3 billion for Phillips 66 Partners. Including our share of expected capital spending by joint ventures DCP Midstream, LLC (DCP Midstream), Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC (CPChem) and WRB Refining LP (WRB), our total 2016 capital program is expected to be $5.3 billion. This program is designed primarily to grow our Midstream and Chemicals segments, which have planned expansions for manufacturing and logistics capacity. The need for additional new gathering and processing, pipeline, storage and distribution infrastructure–driven by domestic unconventional crude oil, natural gas liquids (NGL) and natural gas production–is creating capital investment opportunities in our Midstream business. Over the next few years, CPChem plans significant 32Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statementsreinvestment of its earnings to build additional manufacturing capacity benefiting from cost-advantaged NGL feedstocks. We continue to focus on funding the most attractive growth opportunities across our portfolio.In 2013, we formed Phillips 66 Partners, a master limited partnership, to own, operate, develop and acquire primarily fee-based crude oil, refined petroleum product and NGL pipelines and terminals, as well as other transportation and midstream assets. Phillips 66 Partners provides a cost-efficient vehicle to fund Midstream growth. •Returns. We plan to improve refining returns by increasing throughput of advantaged feedstocks, disciplined capital allocation and portfolio optimization. A disciplined capital allocation process ensures that we focus investments in projects that generate competitive returns throughout the business cycle. During 2015, 93 percent of the company's U.S. crude slate was advantaged.•Distributions. We believe shareholder value is enhanced through, among other things, consistent and ongoing growth of regular dividends, supplemented by share repurchases. We increased our quarterly dividend rate by 12 percent during 2015, and have increased it 180 percent since our separation from ConocoPhillips in 2012 (the Separation). Regular dividends demonstrate the confidence our management has in our capital structure and operation’s capability to generate free cash flow throughout the business cycle. Through December 31, 2015, we have cumulatively repurchased $6.4 billion, or approximately 92.5 million shares, of our common stock. At the discretion of our Board of Directors, we plan to increase dividends annually and fund our share repurchase program while continuing to invest in the growth of our business. In October 2015, our Board of Directors increased our current share repurchase authorization by $2 billion resulting in a total authorization of $4 billion. Since July 2012, our Board of Directors has authorized repurchases of our outstanding common stock totaling up to $9 billion. •High-Performing Organization. We strive to attract, train, develop and retain individuals with the knowledge and skills to implement our business strategy and who support our values and culture. Throughout the company, we focus on getting results in the right way and believe success is both what we do and how we do it. We encourage collaboration throughout our company, while valuing differences, respecting diversity of thought, and creating a great place to work. We foster an environment of learning and development through structured programs focused on enhancing functional and technical skills where employees are engaged in our business and committed to their own, as well as the company’s, success. 33Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsBusiness EnvironmentThe dramatic fall in commodity prices, which started during the second half of 2014, continued throughout 2015. The U.S. oil rig count declined over 60 percent and crude oil production declined well below its peak which was set during the second quarter of 2015. Additionally, the discount for U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) vs. the international benchmark Brent narrowed over the course of 2015 as logistical constraints between oil producing areas and major refining centers were incrementally removed during the year. Falling commodity prices have had a variety of impacts, both favorable and unfavorable, on our downstream businesses that vary by segment. Earnings in the Midstream segment, which includes our 50 percent equity investment in DCP Midstream, are closely linked to NGL prices, natural gas prices and crude oil prices. NGL prices weakened throughout 2015 as NGL production growth from liquids-rich shale plays outpaced domestic demand growth from the petrochemical industry while export capacity remained constrained—driving prices lower and pushing inventories higher. Natural gas prices weakened throughout 2015 as well, as natural gas production growth continued and unseasonably warm weather limited demand. During 2015, our Chemicals segment, which consists of our 50 percent equity investment in CPChem, continued to benefit from feedstock cost advantages associated with manufacturing ethylene in regions of the world with significant NGL production. The chemicals and plastics industry is mainly a commodity-based industry where the margins for key products are based on supply and demand, as well as cost factors. The petrochemicals industry continues to experience lower ethylene cash costs in regions of the world where ethylene manufacturing is based upon NGL rather than crude oil-derived feedstocks. In particular, companies with North American light NGL-based crackers have benefited from lower-priced feedstocks; however, the ethylene-to-polyethylene chain margins were compressed in 2015 because of the significant decline in crude oil prices that began in 2014.Our Refining segment is driven by several factors including refining margins, cost control, refinery throughput and product yields. Refinery margins, often referred to as crack spreads, are measured as the difference between market prices for refined petroleum products and crude oil. During 2015, the U.S. 3:2:1 crack spread (three barrels of crude oil producing two barrels of gasoline and one barrel of diesel) improved over 2014 across all quarters, largely attributable to strong gasoline crack spreads which were driven by robust demand growth both in the U.S. and globally. The diesel crack spread weakened throughout 2015, driven by growing product inventories as a result of high refinery utilization to capture robust gasoline cracks and an unseasonably warm fourth quarter. The U.S. West Coast crack spread increased year over year as a result of significant refinery planned/unplanned maintenance in the region.European refineries benefited during 2015 as domestic and export gasoline demand expanded considerably. Northwest European crack spreads on average increased in the first three quarters of the year and declined in the fourth quarter resulting in an average increase in 2015 compared to 2014. Strong margins were driven by the strength in gasoline margins which offset subdued diesel cracks during much of the year as large volumes of imported diesel from the United States, India, Asia Pacific and Russia kept diesel margins under pressure throughout the second half of the year.Results for our Marketing and Specialties (M&S) segment depend largely on marketing fuel margins, lubricant margins and other specialty product margins. While M&S margins are primarily based on market factors, largely determined by the relationship between supply and demand, marketing fuel margins, in particular, are primarily determined by the trend of spot prices for refined products. Generally speaking, a downward trend of spot prices has a favorable impact on marketing fuel margins, while an upward trend of spot prices has an unfavorable impact on marketing fuel margins.34Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsRESULTS OF OPERATIONSConsolidated ResultsA summary of the company’s earnings follows: Millions of Dollars Year Ended December 31 2015 2014 2013 Midstream$13 507 469Chemicals962 1,137 986Refining2,555 1,771 1,747Marketing and Specialties1,187 1,034 894Corporate and Other(490) (393) (431)Income from continuing operations attributable to Phillips 664,227 4,056 3,665Discontinued Operations— 706 61Net income attributable to Phillips 66$4,227 4,762 3,7262015 vs. 2014 Our earnings from continuing operations increased $171 million, or 4 percent, in 2015, primarily resulting from: •Improved realized refining margins as a result of increased gasoline crack spreads and improved secondary product margins. •Recognition of $242 million after-tax in 2015, compared with $126 million after-tax in 2014, of the deferred gain related to the sale in 2013 of the Immingham Combined Heat and Power Plant (ICHP).These increases were partially offset by:•Lower equity earnings from DCP Midstream, primarily as a result of goodwill and other asset impairments and lower commodity prices. •Lower ethylene margins in our Chemicals segment. 2014 vs. 2013 Our earnings from continuing operations increased $391 million, or 11 percent, in 2014, primarily resulting from: •A gain on disposition and related deferred tax adjustment associated with the sale of Malaysian Refining Company Sdn. Bdh. (MRC), together totaling $369 million after-tax. •Improved ethylene and polyethylene margins in our Chemicals segment. •Improved worldwide marketing margins.•Recognition in 2014 of $126 million, after-tax, of the previously deferred gain related to the sale in 2013 of the ICHP. •Improved secondary products margins in our Refining segment. 35Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsThese increases were partially offset by: •A $131 million after-tax impairment related to the Whitegate Refinery in Cork, Ireland. •Lower realized gasoline and distillate margins as a result of decreased market crack spreads and lower feedstock advantage. •Lower equity earnings from DCP Midstream, reflecting the sharp drop in NGL and crude oil prices in the second half of 2014. Discontinued operations in 2014 included the recognition of a noncash $696 million after-tax gain related to the Phillips Specialty Products Inc. (PSPI) share exchange. See the “Segment Results” section for additional information on our segment results.Income Statement Analysis2015 vs. 2014 Sales and other operating revenues decreased 39 percent in 2015, while purchased crude oil and products decreased 46 percent. The decreases were primarily due to lower average prices for petroleum products, crude oil and NGL.Equity in earnings of affiliates decreased 36 percent in 2015, primarily resulting from decreased earnings from DCP Midstream, CPChem and WRB. •Equity in earnings of DCP Midstream decreased $676 million in 2015. The decrease was primarily due to lower NGL, crude oil and natural gas prices. In addition, DCP Midstream recorded goodwill and other asset impairments in 2015 due to the significant downturn in commodity prices since mid-2014. •Equity in earnings of CPChem decreased 19 percent, primarily due to lower ethylene margins and lower equity earnings from CPChem’s equity affiliates, partially offset by lower utility costs. •Equity in earnings of WRB decreased 13 percent, primarily driven by its lower realized refining margins, resulting from lower feedstock advantage partially offset by higher secondary product margins. Impairments in 2015 were $7 million, compared with $150 million in 2014. There were no significant impairments in 2015, compared with a $131 million impairment of the Whitegate Refinery recorded in 2014. For additional information, see Note 10—Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Interest and debt expense increased 16 percent in 2015. The increase was mainly due to a higher average debt principal balance in 2015, partially offset by increased capitalized interest. See Note 21—Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for information regarding our provision for income taxes and effective tax rates.2014 vs. 2013 Sales and other operating revenues decreased 6 percent in 2014, while purchased crude oil and products decreased 8 percent. The decreases were primarily due to lower average prices for crude oil and petroleum products.36Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsEquity in earnings of affiliates decreased 20 percent in 2014, primarily resulting from decreased earnings from WRB and DCP Midstream, partially offset by increased equity earnings from CPChem. •Equity in earnings of WRB decreased 69 percent, mainly due to lower refining margins in the Central Corridor as a result of lower market crack spreads and a lower feedstock advantage, as well as lower interest income received from equity affiliates. •Equity in earnings of DCP Midstream decreased 36 percent, primarily due to a decrease in most commodity prices, as well as increased costs associated with planned asset growth. •Equity in earnings of CPChem increased 20 percent, primarily driven by improved ethylene and polyethylene realized margins related to increased sales prices. Net gain on dispositions in 2014 was $295 million, compared with $55 million in 2013, primarily resulting from net gains associated with the sale of our interest in MRC in the amount of $145 million, as well as the partial recognition of the previously deferred gain related to the sale of ICHP in the amount of $126 million. In 2013, net gain on dispositions primarily resulted from a $48 million gain on the sale of our E-GasTM Technology business. For additional information, see Note 6—Assets Held for Sale or Sold, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 13 percent in 2014, primarily due to additional fees under marketing consignment fuels agreements, as well as costs associated with acquisitions. Impairments in 2014 were $150 million, compared with $29 million in 2013. In 2014, we recorded a $131 million impairment of the Whitegate Refinery. For additional information, see Note 10—Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Income from discontinued operations increased $645 million in 2014, compared to 2013, due to the completion of the PSPI share exchange in 2014. See Note 6—Assets Held for Sale or Sold, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information on this transaction.

The Midstream segment gathers, processes, transports and markets natural gas; and transports, fractionates and markets NGL in the United States. In addition, this segment transports crude oil and other feedstocks to our refineries and other locations, delivers refined and specialty products to market, and provides terminaling and storage services for crude oil and petroleum products. The Midstream segment includes our master limited partnership, Phillips 66 Partners LP, as well as our 50 percent equity investment in DCP Midstream.2015 vs. 2014 Earnings from the Midstream segment decreased $494 million in 2015, compared with 2014. The decrease was primarily due to lower earnings from DCP Midstream and our NGL business, partially offset by higher earnings from our transportation business.Transportation earnings increased $55 million in 2015, compared with 2014. This increase reflects the startup of our Bayway and Ferndale crude oil rail unloading facilities in the second half of 2014, as well as a full year of operations from the Beaumont Terminal acquired in 2014. Increased railcar fleet activities, higher terminal revenues, and improved earnings from equity affiliates also benefited earnings in 2015. These benefits were partially offset by higher earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests.38Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsEarnings associated with our investment in DCP Midstream decreased $459 million in 2015, compared with 2014. The decrease in 2015 mainly resulted from lower NGL, crude oil, and natural gas prices, partially offset by increased volumes due to asset growth, and lower operating costs as a result of cost saving initiatives. In addition, goodwill and other asset impairments recorded by DCP Midstream in 2015 contributed to the loss recognized from our investment in DCP Midstream. DCP Midstream performed a goodwill impairment assessment and other asset impairment assessments based on internal discounted cash flow models taking into account various observable and non-observable factors, such as prices, volumes, expenses and discount rates. The impairment tests resulted in DCP Midstream’s recognition of a $460 million goodwill impairment and $342 million in other asset impairments, net of tax impacts. Together, these impairments reduced our equity earnings from DCP Midstream by $232 million after-tax. DCP Midstream Partners, LP (DCP Partners), a master limited partnership formed by DCP Midstream, periodically issues limited partner units to the public. These issuances benefited our equity in earnings from DCP Midstream, on an after-tax basis, by approximately $1 million in 2015, compared with approximately $45 million in 2014.The earnings from our NGL business decreased $90 million in 2015, compared with 2014. The decrease was primarily driven by lower realized margins and higher earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests. We also incurred higher tax expense in 2015, driven by a lower manufacturing deduction resulting from bonus depreciation associated with the start-up of Sweeny Fractionator One. These decreases were partially offset by higher earnings from equity affiliates.See the “Business Environment and Executive Overview” section for information on market factors impacting this year’s results.As previously disclosed, in early 2015 we and our co-venturer in DCP Midstream agreed to forgo cash distributions from DCP Midstream due to the significant decrease in commodity prices since mid-2014. The sustained weak commodity price environment during 2015 caused DCP Midstream to impair its goodwill in 2015 by $460 million, and impair certain assets and in-process capital projects in the fourth quarter of 2015 by an additional $342 million. To strengthen its balance sheet, during the fourth quarter of 2015 we contributed $1.5 billion of cash to DCP Midstream, while our co-venturer contributed its interests in certain operating assets held as equity investments. At December 31, 2015, the carrying value of our investment in DCP Midstream was approximately $2.3 billion. We will continue to monitor DCP Midstream’s operations and the continued weak commodity price environment for any further impacts on DCP Midstream or the carrying value of our investment. 2014 vs. 2013 Earnings from the Midstream segment increased $38 million in 2014, compared with 2013. The improvement was primarily driven by higher earnings from our Transportation and NGL businesses, partially offset by lower earnings from DCP Midstream. Transportation earnings increased $34 million in 2014, compared with 2013. This increase primarily resulted from increased throughput fees, as well as higher earnings associated with railcar activity in 2014. These increases were partially offset by higher earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests, reflecting the contribution of previously wholly owned assets to Phillips 66 Partners. The $75 million decrease in earnings of DCP Midstream in 2014 primarily resulted from a decrease in NGL and crude prices in the latter part of 2014. NGL and crude prices have continued to decline in the early part of 2015. In addition, earnings decreased as costs associated with asset growth and maintenance increased in 2014, compared with 2013. Earnings further declined due to DCP Midstream’s contribution of assets to DCP Partners. Following the contribution, a percentage of the earnings from these assets are attributable to public unitholders, thus decreasing income attributable to DCP Midstream and, thereby, Phillips 66. See the “Business Environment and Executive Overview” section for additional information on market factors impacting DCP Midstream’s results.DCP Partners unit issuances benefited our equity in earnings from DCP Midstream, on an after-tax basis, by approximately $45 million in 2014, compared with approximately $62 million in 2013.39Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsEarnings from the NGL business increased $79 million, compared with 2013. The increase was primarily due to improved margins driven by strong propane prices in early 2014. Additionally, 2014 earnings benefited from gains related to seasonal propane and butane storage activity. Also, earnings improved due to higher equity earnings from DCP Sand Hills, LLC (Sand Hills) and DCP Southern Hills, LLC (Southern Hills). These increases were partially offset by an increase in costs associated with growth projects.

Olefins and Polyolefins Capacity Utilization (percent)91% 88 88The Chemicals segment consists of our 50 percent interest in CPChem, which we account for under the equity method. CPChem uses NGL and other feedstocks to produce petrochemicals. These products are then marketed and sold or used as feedstocks to produce plastics and other chemicals. We structure our reporting of CPChem’s operations around two primary business segments: Olefins and Polyolefins (O&P) and Specialties, Aromatics and Styrenics (SA&S). The O&P business segment produces and markets ethylene and other olefin products; ethylene produced is primarily consumed within CPChem for the production of polyethylene, normal alpha olefins and polyethylene pipe. The SA&S business segment manufactures and markets aromatics and styrenics products, such as benzene, styrene, paraxylene and cyclohexane, as well as polystyrene and styrene-butadiene copolymers. SA&S also manufactures and/or markets a variety of specialty chemical products. Unless otherwise noted, amounts referenced below reflect our net 50 percent interest in CPChem.2015 vs. 2014 Earnings from the Chemicals segment decreased $175 million, or 15 percent, in 2015, compared with 2014. The decrease in earnings was primarily due to lower margins resulting from lower sales prices, lower earnings from CPChem’s O&P equity affiliates, and higher turnaround and maintenance activities. These decreases were partially offset by higher ethylene and polyethylene sales volumes, as well as lower repair costs due to the impact on 2014 costs of the fire at CPChem’s Port Arthur, Texas facility. Lower feedstock costs, lower utility costs due to falling natural gas prices, and lower impairment charges also benefited the 2015 operating results. In July 2014, a localized fire occurred in the olefins unit at CPChem’s Port Arthur, Texas facility, shutting down ethylene production. The Port Arthur ethylene unit restarted in November 2014. CPChem incurred, on a 100 percent basis, $85 million of associated repair and rebuild costs. Because the Port Arthur ethylene unit was down due to the fire, CPChem experienced a significant reduction in production and sales in several of its product lines stemming from the lack of the Port Arthur ethylene supply in 2014. CPChem recorded earnings, on a 100 percent basis, of $88 million and $120 million for business interruption and property damage insurance proceeds in 2015 and 2014, respectively. 40Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsSee the “Business Environment and Executive Overview” section for information on market factors impacting CPChem’s results.2014 vs. 2013Earnings from the Chemicals segment increased $151 million, or 15 percent, in 2014, compared with 2013. The increase in earnings was primarily driven by improved ethylene and polyethylene realized margins due to higher sales prices. Additionally, Chemicals benefited from higher equity earnings from CPChem’s O&P equity affiliates.These increases were partially offset by lower ethylene and polyethylene sales volumes and increased costs related to the Port Arthur facility fire. In addition, impairments of $69 million after-tax in 2014 further offset a portion of the increase to earnings. 41Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsRefining Year Ended December 31 2015 2014 2013 Millions of DollarsNet Income Attributable to Phillips 66 Atlantic Basin/Europe$569 198 9Gulf Coast551 252 113Central Corridor857 967 1,540Western/Pacific578 354 85Worldwide$2,555 1,771 1,747 Dollars Per BarrelRefining Margins Atlantic Basin/Europe$9.39 8.94 7.09Gulf Coast9.29 7.64 6.49Central Corridor14.88 15.63 19.30Western/Pacific16.86 8.89 8.83Worldwide11.84 9.93 9.90 Thousands of Barrels DailyOperating Statistics Refining operations* Atlantic Basin/Europe Crude oil capacity588 588 588Crude oil processed539 554 546Capacity utilization (percent)92% 94 93Refinery production587 605 578Gulf Coast Crude oil capacity738 733 733Crude oil processed654 676 651Capacity utilization (percent)89% 92 89Refinery production733 771 736Central Corridor Crude oil capacity492 485 477Crude oil processed465 475 472Capacity utilization (percent)95% 98 99Refinery production486 494 489Western/Pacific Crude oil capacity360 440 440Crude oil processed330 403 410Capacity utilization (percent)92% 92 93Refinery production359 435 445Worldwide Crude oil capacity2,178 2,246 2,238Crude oil processed1,988 2,108 2,079Capacity utilization (percent)91% 94 93Refinery production2,165 2,305 2,248*Includes our share of equity affiliates. 42Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsThe Refining segment buys, sells and refines crude oil and other feedstocks into petroleum products (such as gasoline, distillates and aviation fuels) at 14 refineries, mainly in the United States and Europe.2015 vs. 2014 Earnings for the Refining segment increased $784 million, or 44 percent, compared with 2014. The increase in earnings in 2015 primarily resulted from higher realized refining margins due to higher gasoline crack spreads and improved secondary product margins, as well as lower utility costs. These increases were partially offset by lower feedstock advantage, lower distillate crack spreads, lower clean product differentials, and lower refining volumes as a result of higher unplanned downtime and turnaround activities. See the “Business Environment and Executive Overview” section for information on industry crack spreads and other market factors impacting this year’s results.Our worldwide refining crude oil capacity utilization rate was 91 percent in 2015, compared to 94 percent in 2014. The decrease reflects higher unplanned downtime and turnaround activities. Effective January 1, 2015, we aligned the results of the activities previously included in “Other Refining” into the Atlantic Basin/Europe, Gulf Coast, Central Corridor, and Western/Pacific refining regions. There were no changes to the consolidated Refining operating segment as a result of this alignment. The new alignment is presented for the year ended December 31, 2015, with the prior periods retrospectively adjusted for comparability. 2014 vs. 2013 Earnings for the Refining segment were $1,771 million in 2014, an increase of $24 million, or 1 percent, compared with 2013. The slight increase in earnings in 2014 was primarily due to higher realized refining margins related to secondary products, as well as increased volumes. In addition, earnings were impacted by a gain on disposition and a related deferred tax adjustment associated with the sale of MRC, together totaling $369 million after-tax. These increases were mostly offset by: •Lower earnings from decreased gasoline and distillate margins. •Negative impacts due to inventory draws in a declining price environment.•Impairment of the Whitegate Refinery of $131 million after-tax. •Lower interest income received from equity affiliates. Our worldwide refining crude oil capacity utilization rate was 94 percent in 2014, compared to 93 percent in 2013. The increase reflects lower unplanned downtime related to power outages that occurred in the Gulf Coast region in 2013. 43Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsMarketing and Specialties Year Ended December 31 2015 2014 2013 Millions of DollarsNet Income Attributable to Phillips 66 Marketing and Other$1,004 836 688Specialties183 198 206Total Marketing and Specialties$1,187 1,034 894 Dollars Per BarrelRealized Marketing Fuel Margin* U.S.$1.65 1.51 1.21International4.40 5.22 4.36*On third-party petroleum products sales.

In addition, this segment includes the manufacturing and marketing of specialty products (such as base oils and lubricants), as well as power generation operations. 2015 vs. 2014 Earnings from the M&S segment increased $153 million, or 15 percent, in 2015, compared with 2014. In July 2013, we completed the sale of ICHP, and deferred the gain from the sale due to an indemnity provided to the buyer. We recognized $242 million after-tax and $126 million after-tax of the deferred gain in 2015 and 2014, respectively. Earnings from the M&S segment also benefited from higher domestic marketing activities, higher domestic marketing and lubricants volumes, and increased tax credits from biodiesel blending activities. These benefits were partially offset by lower international marketing margins and lubricants margins. See the “Business Environment and Executive Overview” section for information on marketing fuel margins and other market factors impacting 2015 results.44Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements2014 vs. 2013Earnings from the M&S segment increased $140 million, or 16 percent, in 2014, compared with 2013. Both U.S. and international marketing margins benefited from the timing effect of falling gasoline prices experienced in the second half of 2014. U.S. marketing also benefited from a full year of consignment agreements entered into in 2013, while international marketing margins also benefited from foreign exchange gains in 2014. In 2014, we recognized $126 million after-tax of the deferred gain related to the sale in 2013 of the ICHP, increasing earnings. These increases were partially offset by the lack of ICHP earnings in 2014, compared with earnings of $53 million in 2013.

Net interest expense increased $26 million in 2015, compared with 2014, primarily due to a higher average debt principal balance as a result of the issuance of debt in the fourth quarter of 2014 and Phillips 66 Partners’ debt issuance in the first quarter of 2015. The increase was partially offset by higher capitalized interest. For additional information, see Note 13—Debt, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.The category “Other” includes certain income tax expenses, environmental costs associated with sites no longer in operation, foreign currency transaction gains and losses and other costs not directly associated with an operating segment. The increase in costs in 2015 was primarily due to foreign tax credit carryforwards that were utilized in 2014 and other tax adjustments made in 2015. 2014 vs. 2013Net interest expense decreased $6 million in 2014, compared with 2013, primarily due to increased capitalized interest. This decrease in expense was partially offset due to an increase in average debt outstanding in 2014, reflecting the issuance of debt in late 2014. For additional information, see Note 13—Debt, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Corporate general and administrative expenses increased $11 million in 2014, compared with 2013. The increase was primarily due to increased employee benefit costs and charitable contributions. The decrease in other costs was primarily due to increased utilization of foreign tax credit carryforwards. In addition, higher environmental costs negatively affected our 2013 results. 45Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsDiscontinued Operations Millions of Dollars Year Ended December 31 2015 2014 2013Net Income Attributable to Phillips 66 Discontinued operations$— 706 61In December 2013, we entered into an agreement to exchange the stock of PSPI, a flow improver business that was included in our M&S segment, for shares of Phillips 66 common stock owned by the other party to the transaction. In February 2014, we completed the PSPI share exchange, resulting in the receipt of approximately 17.4 million shares of Phillips 66 common stock and the recognition of a before-tax noncash gain of $696 million. See Note 6—Assets Held for Sale or Sold, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information on this transaction.46Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsCAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITYFinancial Indicators Millions of DollarsExcept as Indicated 2015 2014 2013 Cash and cash equivalents$3,074 5,207 5,400 Net cash provided by operating activities5,713 3,529 6,027 Short-term debt44 842 24 Total debt8,887 8,635 6,125 Total equity23,938 22,037 22,392 Percent of total debt to capital*27% 28 21 Percent of floating-rate debt to total debt1% 1 1 *Capital includes total debt and total equity. To meet our short- and long-term liquidity requirements, we look to a variety of funding sources, including cash generated from operating activities and Phillips 66 Partners’ debt and equity financings. During 2015, we generated $5.7 billion in cash from operations and received $1.1 billion from Phillips 66 Partners’ issuance of senior notes and $0.4 billion from the issuance of Phillips 66 Partners’ common units to the public. We used available cash primarily for capital expenditures and investments ($5.8 billion), including a contribution to DCP Midstream ($1.5 billion); debt repayments ($0.9 billion); repurchases of our common stock ($1.5 billion); and dividend payments on our common stock ($1.2 billion). During 2015, cash and cash equivalents decreased by $2.1 billion, to $3.1 billion.In addition to cash flows from operating activities, we rely on our commercial paper and credit facility programs, asset sales and our ability to issue securities using our shelf registration statement to support our short- and long-term liquidity requirements. We believe current cash and cash equivalents and cash generated by operations, together with access to external sources of funds as described below under “Significant Sources of Capital,” will be sufficient to meet our funding requirements in the near and long term, including our capital spending, dividend payments, defined benefit plan contributions, debt repayment and share repurchases. Significant Sources of CapitalOperating ActivitiesDuring 2015, cash of $5,713 million was provided by operating activities, a 62 percent increase over 2014. Net income in 2015 was lower than 2014; however, in both years large noncash items affected earnings, including the gain on the PSPI exchange in 2014, recognition in 2015 and 2014 of a deferred gain from a 2013 asset disposition, and goodwill and other asset impairments by DCP Midstream in 2015. Excluding these items, underlying earnings in 2015 were slightly improved compared with 2014, primarily reflecting increased refining margins and increased domestic marketing volumes, partially offset by lower midstream prices. Negative working capital impacted operating cash flow by $221 million and $1,020 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively. The lower negative working capital impact in 2015 was driven by decreased refining payables due to lower feedstock costs in 2015 as compared with 2014, partially offset by a reduction in receivables due to reduced commodity prices. See the following paragraph for a discussion of 2014 working capital effects.During 2014, cash of $3,529 million was provided by operating activities, a 41 percent decrease from cash from operations of $6,027 million in 2013. Although net income was higher in 2014 than in 2013, certain large noncash items benefitted 2014 earnings, including the gain on the PSPI exchange, gains from asset dispositions and the deferred tax effects of certain asset dispositions. Excluding these items, underlying earnings in 2014 were similar to 2013. However, working capital negatively impacted 2014 operating cash flow by $1,020 million, compared with a positive impact of $880 million in 2013. Working capital impacts in 2014 reflected the negative impact of lower commodity prices on accounts payable, with a lesser positive impact on accounts receivable as we generally carry higher payables on our 47Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statementsbalance sheet than receivables. By comparison, accounts payable activity increased cash from operations by $360 million in 2013, reflecting both higher volumes and commodity prices, while lower refining margins, reflecting less favorable market conditions and tightening of crude differentials, negatively impacted 2013 working capital. Benefiting 2014 operating cash flow, compared with 2013, was the receipt of a special distribution from WRB, of which $760 million was considered an operating cash flow, partially offset by lower distributions from CPChem.Our short- and long-term operating cash flows are highly dependent upon refining and marketing margins, NGL prices, and chemicals margins. Prices and margins in our industry are typically volatile, and are driven by market conditions over which we have little or no control. Absent other mitigating factors, as these prices and margins fluctuate, we would expect a corresponding change in our operating cash flows.The level and quality of output from our refineries also impacts our cash flows. Factors such as operating efficiency, maintenance turnarounds, market conditions, feedstock availability and weather conditions can affect output. We actively manage the operations of our refineries, and any variability in their operations typically has not been as significant to cash flows as that caused by margins and prices. Our worldwide refining crude oil capacity utilization was 91 percent in 2015, compared with 94 percent in 2014. We expect 2016 utilization to be in the mid 90-percent range. Equity AffiliatesOur operating cash flows are also impacted by distribution decisions made by our equity affiliates, including DCP Midstream, CPChem and WRB. Over the three years ended December 31, 2015, we received distributions of $452 million from DCP Midstream, $2,879 million from CPChem and $2,938 million from WRB. We cannot control the amount or timing of future distributions from equity affiliates; therefore, future distributions by these and other equity affiliates are not assured. We and our co-venturer in DCP Midstream have agreed to forgo distributions from DCP Midstream during the current low-commodity price environment.During the second quarter of 2015, CPChem made a special distribution to its owners, with our share totaling $696 million. CPChem funded the distribution by issuing $1.4 billion of senior notes with maturities ranging from three to five years, with a combination of fixed and variable interest rates. This cash inflow from CPChem was included in operating cash flows, as we had cumulative undistributed equity earnings attributable to CPChem in excess of the amount distributed.WRB is a 50-percent-owned business venture with Cenovus Energy Inc. (Cenovus). Cenovus was obligated to contribute $7.5 billion, plus accrued interest, to WRB over a 10-year period that began in 2007. In 2014, Cenovus prepaid its remaining balance under this obligation. As a result, WRB declared a special dividend, which was distributed to the co-venturers in 2014. Of the $1,232 million that we received, $760 million was considered a return on our investment in WRB (an operating cash inflow), and $472 million was considered a return of our investment in WRB (an investing cash inflow). The return-of-investment portion of the dividend was included in the “Proceeds from asset dispositions” line in our consolidated statement of cash flows. A further $129 million of distributions from WRB during 2014 was considered a return of investment.Asset SalesNet proceeds from asset sales in 2015 were $70 million, compared with $1,244 million in 2014 and $1,214 million in 2013. The 2015 net proceeds were attributed to the sale of the Bantry Bay terminal in Ireland and the sale of certain retail sites in Kansas and Missouri, and were partially offset by a working capital true-up related to the 2014 sale of our interest in MRC. The 2014 proceeds included a portion of the WRB special dividend as discussed above, as well as the sale of our interest in MRC. The 2013 proceeds included the sale of a power plant in the United Kingdom, as well as our gasification technology.Foreign Cash HoldingsAt December 31, 2015, approximately 44 percent of our consolidated cash and cash equivalents balance was available to fund domestic opportunities without incurring material additional U.S. income taxes in excess of the amounts already accrued in the financial statements. We believe the remaining amount, primarily attributable to cash we hold in foreign locations where we have asserted our intention to indefinitely reinvest earnings, does not materially affect our consolidated liquidity due to the following factors:48Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements•A substantial portion of our foreign cash supports the liquidity needs and regulatory requirements of our foreign operations.•We have the ability to fund a significant portion of our domestic capital requirements with cash provided by domestic operating activities.•We have access to U.S. capital markets through our $5 billion committed revolving credit facility, commercial paper program, and shelf registration statement.See Note 21—Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information on income taxes associated with foreign earnings.Income TaxesAs part of our normal tax administrative process, we made scheduled U.S. federal income tax payments in 2015 using the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) safe harbor method for estimated 2015 taxable income. We determined that a portion of those payments is refundable as an overpayment of estimated tax, primarily due to U.S. tax legislation enacted late in the year, and we filed a refund claim with the IRS in the first quarter of 2016. We expect this refund to benefit cash from operations in the first quarter of 2016 by approximately $590 million.Phillips 66 Partners LPInitial Public OfferingIn 2013, we formed Phillips 66 Partners LP, a master limited partnership, to own, operate, develop and acquire primarily fee-based crude oil, refined petroleum product and NGL pipelines and terminals, as well as other transportation and midstream assets. On July 26, 2013, Phillips 66 Partners completed its initial public offering (IPO) of 18,888,750 common units at a price of $23.00 per unit. Phillips 66 Partners received $404 million in net proceeds from the sale of the units, after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions, structuring fees and offering expenses.Contributions to Phillips 66 Partners LPEffective March 1, 2014, we contributed to Phillips 66 Partners certain transportation, terminaling and storage assets for total consideration of $700 million. These assets consisted of the Gold Line products system and the Medford spheres, two recently constructed refinery-grade propylene storage spheres. Phillips 66 Partners financed the acquisition with cash on hand of $400 million (primarily reflecting its IPO proceeds), the issuance to us of 3,530,595 and 72,053 additional common and general partner units, respectively, valued at $140 million, and a five-year, $160 million note payable to a subsidiary of Phillips 66.Effective December 1, 2014, we contributed to Phillips 66 Partners certain logistics assets for total consideration of $340 million. These assets consisted of two recently constructed crude oil rail-unloading facilities located at or adjacent to our Bayway and Ferndale refineries, and the Cross Channel Connector pipeline assets located near the partnership’s Pasadena terminal. Phillips 66 Partners financed the acquisition with the borrowing of $28 million under its revolving credit facility, the assumption of a five-year, $244 million note payable to a subsidiary of Phillips 66, and the issuance to Phillips 66 of 1,066,412 common and 21,764 general partner units valued at $68 million.In addition to these two transactions, we made smaller contributions to Phillips 66 Partners of projects under development in the fourth quarter of 2014, for consideration in the aggregate of approximately $55 million.Effective March 2, 2015, we contributed to Phillips 66 Partners our one-third equity interests in Sand Hills and Southern Hills, as well as our 19.5 percent equity interest in Explorer Pipeline Company (Explorer), for total consideration of $1,010 million. Each of these investments is accounted for under the equity method of accounting. Phillips 66 Partners financed the acquisition with $880 million in cash, partially funded by a public offering of common units representing limited partner interests and debt financing, and the issuance to us of 1,587,376 and 139,538 additional common units and general partner units, respectively, with an aggregate fair value of $130 million.Effective December 1, 2015, we contributed to Phillips 66 Partners our 40 percent equity interest in Bayou Bridge Pipeline, LLC (Bayou Bridge) for total consideration of $70 million. This investment is accounted for under the equity method of accounting. Phillips 66 Partners financed one-half of the acquisition with a $35 million note payable to us and one-half with the issuance to us of 606,056 and 12,369 additional common units and general partner units, respectively, 49Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statementshaving an aggregate fair value of $35 million. Phillips 66 Partners immediately repaid the note payable. See Note 13—Debt and Note 27—Phillips 66 Partners LP, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information.OwnershipAt December 31, 2015, we owned a 69 percent limited partner interest and a 2 percent general partner interest in Phillips 66 Partners, while its public unitholders owned a 29 percent limited partner interest. We consolidate Phillips 66 Partners as a variable interest entity for financial reporting purposes. See Note 3—Variable Interest Entities (VIEs), in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information on why we consolidate the partnership. As a result of this consolidation, the public unitholders’ ownership interest in Phillips 66 Partners is reflected as an $809 million noncontrolling interest in our financial statements at December 31, 2015. Generally, contributions of assets by us to Phillips 66 Partners will eliminate in consolidation, except for third-party debt or equity offerings made by Phillips 66 Partners to finance such transactions. For the first contribution in 2015 together with the public offerings of common units and senior notes discussed below, our consolidated cash increased by $1.5 billion, consolidated debt increased by $1.1 billion and consolidated equity increased by $384 million as a result of the transactions. The Bayou Bridge contribution in 2015 discussed above did not impact our consolidated financial statements. For the 2014 contributions discussed above, the first did not impact our consolidated financial statements, while the second increased consolidated cash and debt by $28 million at the time of the transaction.Debt and Equity FinancingsIn February 2015, Phillips 66 Partners closed on a public offering of $1.1 billion aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes, consisting of:•$300 million of 2.646% Senior Notes due 2020.•$500 million of 3.605% Senior Notes due 2025.•$300 million of 4.680% Senior Notes due 2045.Interest on each series of the senior notes is payable semi-annually in arrears.In February 2015, Phillips 66 Partners completed a public offering of 5,250,000 common units representing limited partner interests. The net proceeds received at closing were $384 million. Phillips 66 Partners used a portion of the net proceeds of both the debt and equity offerings to fund its March 2015 acquisition transaction described above. See Note 27—Phillips 66 Partners LP, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information on this acquisition.Credit Facilities and Commercial PaperPhillips 66 has a $5 billion revolving credit facility that extends until December 2019. The facility may be used for direct bank borrowings, as support for issuances of letters of credit, or as support for our commercial paper program. The facility is with a broad syndicate of financial institutions and contains covenants that we consider usual and customary for an agreement of this type for comparable commercial borrowers, including a maximum consolidated net debt-to-capitalization ratio of 60 percent. The agreement has customary events of default, such as nonpayment of principal when due; nonpayment of interest, fees or other amounts; violation of covenants; cross-payment default and cross-acceleration (in each case, to indebtedness in excess of a threshold amount); and a change of control. Borrowings under the facility will incur interest at the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a margin based on the credit rating of our senior unsecured long-term debt as determined from time to time by Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services (S&P) and Moody’s Investors Service (Moody’s). The facility also provides for customary fees, including administrative agent fees and commitment fees. As of December 31, 2015, no amount had been directly drawn under our $5 billion credit facility; however, $51 million in letters of credit had been issued that were supported by this facility. As a result, we ended 2015 with $4.9 billion of capacity under this facility.We have a $5 billion commercial paper program for short-term working capital needs. Commercial paper maturities are generally limited to 90 days. As of December 31, 2015, we had no borrowings under our commercial paper program.50Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsPhillips 66 Partners has a $500 million revolving credit facility that extends until November 2019. The Phillips 66 Partners facility is with a broad syndicate of financial institutions. As of December 31, 2015, no amounts were outstanding under the facility.Debt FinancingOur $7.5 billion of outstanding Senior Notes were issued by Phillips 66 and are guaranteed by Phillips 66 Company, a 100-percent-owned subsidiary. Our senior unsecured long-term debt has been rated investment grade by S&P (BBB+) and Moody’s (A3). We do not have any ratings triggers on any of our corporate debt that would cause an automatic default, and thereby impact our access to liquidity, in the event of a downgrade of our credit rating. If our credit rating deteriorated to a level prohibiting us from accessing the commercial paper market, we would expect to be able to access funds under our liquidity facilities mentioned above.Shelf RegistrationWe have a universal shelf registration statement on file with the SEC under which we, as a well-known seasoned issuer, have the ability to issue and sell an indeterminate amount of various types of debt and equity securities.Other FinancingWe have capital lease obligations related to equipment and transportation assets, and the use of an oil terminal in the United Kingdom. These leases mature within the next eighteen years. The present value of our minimum capital lease payments for these obligations as of December 31, 2015, was $208 million.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsAs part of our normal ongoing business operations, we enter into agreements with other parties to pursue business opportunities, with costs and risks apportioned among the parties as provided by the agreements. In April 2012, in connection with the Separation, we entered into an agreement to guarantee 100 percent of certain outstanding debt obligations of Merey Sweeny, L.P. (MSLP). At December 31, 2015, the aggregate principal amount of MSLP debt guaranteed by us was $157 million.For additional information about guarantees, see Note 14—Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Capital RequirementsFor information about our capital expenditures and investments, see “Capital Spending” below.Our debt balance at December 31, 2015, was $8.9 billion and our debt-to-capital ratio was 27 percent. Excluding Phillips 66 Partners’ debt of $1.1 billion and its noncontrolling interest of $809 million, our adjusted debt-to-capital ratio at December 31, 2015, was 25 percent. Our target adjusted debt-to-capital ratio, excluding the impact of Phillips 66 Partners, is between 20 and 30 percent.On February 3, 2016, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.56 per common share, payable March 1, 2016, to holders of record at the close of business on February 16, 2016. We are forecasting a double-digit percentage increase in our quarterly dividend rate in 2016.During the second half of 2013, we entered into a construction agency agreement and an operating lease agreement with a financial institution for the construction of our new headquarters facility in Houston, Texas. Under the construction agency agreement, we act as construction agent for the financial institution over a construction period of up to three years and eight months, during which time we request cash draws from the financial institution to fund construction costs. Through December 31, 2015, approximately $486 million had been drawn to fund construction costs, of which approximately $440 million is recourse to us should certain events of default occur. The operating lease becomes effective after construction is substantially complete and we are able to occupy the facility. The operating lease has a term of five years and provides us the option, at the end of the lease term, to request to renew the lease, purchase the facility, or assist the financial institution in marketing it for resale. We expect the lease to commence in the first half of 2016.On October 9, 2015, our Board of Directors increased our current share repurchase authorization by $2 billion resulting in a total authorization of $4 billion. Since July 2012, our Board of Directors has authorized repurchases of our 51Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statementsoutstanding common stock totaling up to $9 billion. The share repurchases are expected to be funded primarily through available cash. The shares will be repurchased from time to time in the open market at our discretion, subject to market conditions and other factors, and in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements. We are not obligated to acquire any particular amount of common stock and may commence, suspend or discontinue purchases at any time or from time to time without prior notice. Since the inception of our share repurchases in 2012 through December 31, 2015, we have repurchased a total of 92,503,292 shares at a cost of $6.4 billion. Shares of stock repurchased are held as treasury shares.On May 1, 2015, the U.S. Department of Transportation issued a final rule focused on the safe transportation of flammable liquids by rail. The final rule, which is being challenged, subjects new and existing railcars transporting crude oil in high volumes to heightened design standards, including thicker tank walls and heat shields, improved pressure relief valves and enhanced braking systems. We are currently evaluating the impact of the new regulations on our crude oil railcar fleet, which is mostly held under operating leases. The regulations become effective subsequent to the expiration dates of our leases. Although we have no direct contractual obligation to retrofit these leased railcars, certain leases are subject to residual value guarantees. Under the lease terms, we have the option either to purchase the railcars or to return them to the lessors. If railcars are returned to the lessors, we may be required to make the lessors whole under the residual value guarantees, which are subject to a cap. The current market demand for crude oil railcars is low, which has resulted in a significant decline in crude oil railcar prices. Due to current market uncertainties, it is not currently possible to reasonably estimate the future market value for railcars at the end of their lease terms.52Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsContractual ObligationsThe following table summarizes our aggregate contractual fixed and variable obligations as of December 31, 2015: Millions of Dollars Payments Due by Period Total Up to1 Year Years2-3 Years4-5 After5 Years Debt obligations (a)$8,679 28 1,565 352 6,734Capital lease obligations208 16 31 22 139Total debt8,887 44 1,596 374 6,873Interest on debt6,735 394 714 678 4,949Operating lease obligations2,009 510 726 405 368Purchase obligations (b)62,691 23,502 8,497 5,530 25,162Other long-term liabilities (c) Asset retirement obligations251 7 16 10 218Accrued environmental costs485 64 104 70 247Unrecognized tax benefits (d)13 13 (d) (d) (d)Total$81,071 24,534 11,653 7,067 37,817 (a)For additional information, see Note 13—Debt, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.(b)Represents any agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable, legally binding and specifies all significant terms. We expect these purchase obligations will be fulfilled by operating cash flows in the applicable maturity period. The majority of the purchase obligations are market-based contracts, including exchanges and futures, for the purchase of products such as crude oil and unfractionated NGL. The products are mostly used to supply our refineries and fractionators, optimize the supply chain, and resell to customers. Product purchase commitments with third parties totaled $32,326 million. In addition, $16,807 million are product purchases from CPChem, mostly for natural gas and NGL over the remaining contractual term of 84 years, and $4,409 million from Excel Paralubes, for base oil over the remaining contractual term of 9 years.Purchase obligations of $5,600 million are related to agreements to access and utilize the capacity of third-party equipment and facilities, including pipelines and product terminals, to transport, process, treat, and store products. The remainder is primarily our net share of purchase commitments for materials and services for jointly owned facilities where we are the operator.(c)Excludes pensions. For the 2016 through 2020 time period, we expect to contribute an average of $170 million per year to our qualified and nonqualified pension and other postretirement benefit plans in the United States and an average of $50 million per year to our non-U.S. plans, which are expected to be in excess of required minimums in many cases. The U.S. five-year average consists of $50 million for 2016 and then approximately $200 million per year for the remaining four years. Our minimum funding in 2016 is expected to be $50 million in the United States and $50 million outside the United States.(d)Excludes unrecognized tax benefits of $69 million because the ultimate disposition and timing of any payments to be made with regard to such amounts are not reasonably estimable or the amounts relate to potential refunds. Also excludes interest and penalties of $19 million. Although unrecognized tax benefits are not a contractual obligation, they are presented in this table because they represent potential demands on our liquidity.53Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsCapital Spending Millions of Dollars 2016Budget 2015 2014 2013Capital Expenditures and Investments Midstream$2,346 4,457 2,173 597Chemicals— — — —Refining1,217 1,069 1,038 820Marketing and Specialties137 122 439 226Corporate and Other180 116 123 136Total consolidated from continuing operations$3,880 5,764 3,773 1,779 Discontinued operations$— — — 27 Selected Equity Affiliates* DCP Midstream$223 438 776 971CPChem**1,016 1,319 886 613WRB184 175 140 109 $1,423 1,932 1,802 1,693 *Our share of capital spending.**2014 amount restated.MidstreamDuring the three-year period ended December 31, 2015, DCP Midstream’s capital expenditures and investments were $4.4 billion on a 100 percent basis. In 2013 and 2014, we made additional investments of $0.3 billion in both Sand Hills and Southern Hills, increasing our total direct investment to $0.8 billion. In October 2015, we contributed $1.5 billion of cash to DCP Midstream and our co-venturer contributed its interests in certain operating assets of equal value, that are held as equity investments. Upon completion of this transaction, our interest in DCP Midstream remained at 50 percent.Other capital spending in our Midstream segment during the three-year period ended December 31, 2015, included:•Construction activities related to our Sweeny Fractionator One and Freeport LPG Export Terminal projects.•Acquisition of a 7.1 million-barrel-storage-capacity crude oil and petroleum products terminal located near Beaumont, Texas.•Construction of rail racks to accept advantaged crude deliveries at our Bayway and Ferndale refineries.•Purchase of an additional 5.7 percent interest in the refined products Explorer pipeline.•Pipeline projects being developed by two of our joint ventures, Dakota Access LLC (DAPL) and Energy Transfer Crude Oil Company, LLC (ETCOP). We own a 25 percent interest in each of these joint ventures.•Spending associated with return, reliability and maintenance projects in our Transportation and NGL businesses.In April 2015, Rockies Express Pipeline LLC (REX) repaid $450 million of its debt, reducing its long-term debt to approximately $2.6 billion. REX funded the repayment through member cash contributions. Our 25 percent share was approximately $112 million, which we contributed to REX in April 2015.54Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsChemicalsDuring the three-year period ended December 31, 2015, CPChem had a self-funded capital program, and thus required no new capital infusions from us or our co-venturer. During this period, on a 100 percent basis, CPChem’s capital expenditures and investments were $5.6 billion. In addition, CPChem’s advances to equity affiliates, primarily used for project construction and start-up activities, were $0.3 billion and its repayments received from equity affiliates were $0.1 billion.RefiningCapital spending for the Refining segment during the three-year period ended December 31, 2015, was $2.9 billion, primarily for air emission reduction and clean fuels projects to meet new environmental standards, refinery upgrade projects to increase accessibility of advantaged crudes and improve product yields, improvements to the operating integrity of key processing units, and safety-related projects.Key projects completed during the three-year period included: •Installation of new coke drums at the Ponca City refinery.•Installation of facilities to reduce nitrous oxide emissions from the fluid catalytic cracker at the Alliance Refinery.•Installation of a tail gas treating unit at the Humber Refinery to reduce emissions from the sulfur recovery units.•Installation of facilities to improve clean product yields at Sweeny and Lake Charles refineries.•Installation of facilities to improve processing of advantaged crudes at Alliance and Ponca City refineries. Major construction activities in progress include: •Installation of a crude tank to increase accessibility of waterborne crude at the Los Angeles Refinery.•Installation of facilities to comply with U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Tier 3 gasoline regulations at the Sweeny, Alliance, Bayway and Lake Charles refineries.•Installation of facilities to improve processing of advantaged crudes at Billings refinery. •Installation of facilities to improve clean product yield at Bayway and Ponca City refineries.Generally, our equity affiliates in the Refining segment are intended to have self-funding capital programs. During this three-year period, on a 100 percent basis, WRB’s capital expenditures and investments were $0.9 billion. We expect WRB’s 2016 capital program to be self-funding.Marketing and SpecialtiesCapital spending for the M&S segment during the three-year period ended December 31, 2015, was primarily for the acquisition of, and investments in, a limited number of retail sites in the Western and Midwestern portions of the United States, which have subsequently been disposed of; the acquisition of Spectrum Corporation, a private label specialty lubricants business headquartered in Memphis, Tennessee; the acquisition of the remaining interest that we did not already own in an entity that operates a power and steam generation plant; reliability and maintenance projects; and projects targeted at growing our international marketing business.Corporate and OtherCapital spending for Corporate and Other during the three-year period ended December 31, 2015, was primarily for projects related to information technology and facilities.2016 BudgetOur 2016 capital budget is $3.9 billion including Phillips 66 Partners’ capital budget of $0.3 billion. This excludes our portion of planned capital spending by joint ventures DCP Midstream, CPChem and WRB totaling $1.4 billion, all of which are expected to be self-funded.55Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsThe Midstream capital budget of $2.3 billion is focused on growth projects, such as continued construction of the 150,000 barrels-per-day Freeport LPG Export Terminal on the U.S. Gulf Coast, the new DAPL and ETCOP pipeline projects, expansion of the Beaumont Terminal, and the Bayou Bridge pipeline project.Refining’s capital budget of $1.2 billion is directed toward reliability, safety and environmental projects, including compliance with the new Tier 3 gasoline specifications, as well as projects designed to improve product yields and lower feedstock costs.In Marketing and Specialties, we plan to invest approximately $0.1 billion for growth and sustaining capital. The growth investment reflects our continued plans to expand and enhance our fuel marketing business.In Corporate and Other, we plan to fund approximately $0.2 billion in projects primarily related to information technology and facilities.ContingenciesA number of lawsuits involving a variety of claims that arose in the ordinary course of business have been filed against us or are subject to indemnifications provided by us. We also may be required to remove or mitigate the effects on the environment of the placement, storage, disposal or release of certain chemical, mineral and petroleum substances at various active and inactive sites. We regularly assess the need for financial recognition or disclosure of these contingencies. In the case of all known contingencies (other than those related to income taxes), we accrue a liability when the loss is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable. If a range of amounts can be reasonably estimated and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount, then the minimum of the range is accrued. We do not reduce these liabilities for potential insurance or third-party recoveries. If applicable, we accrue receivables for probable insurance or other third-party recoveries. In the case of income-tax-related contingencies, we use a cumulative probability-weighted loss accrual in cases where sustaining a tax position is less than certain.Based on currently available information, we believe it is remote that future costs related to known contingent liability exposures will exceed current accruals by an amount that would have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements. As we learn new facts concerning contingencies, we reassess our position both with respect to accrued liabilities and other potential exposures. Estimates particularly sensitive to future changes include contingent liabilities recorded for environmental remediation, tax and legal matters. Estimated future environmental remediation costs are subject to change due to such factors as the uncertain magnitude of cleanup costs, the unknown time and extent of such remedial actions that may be required, and the determination of our liability in proportion to that of other potentially responsible parties. Estimated future costs related to tax and legal matters are subject to change as events evolve and as additional information becomes available during the administrative and litigation processes.Legal and Tax MattersOur legal and tax matters are handled by our legal and tax organizations. These organizations apply their knowledge, experience and professional judgment to the specific characteristics of our cases and uncertain tax positions. We employ a litigation management process to manage and monitor the legal proceedings against us. Our process facilitates the early evaluation and quantification of potential exposures in individual cases and enables the tracking of those cases that have been scheduled for trial and/or mediation. Based on professional judgment and experience in using these litigation management tools and available information about current developments in all our cases, our legal organization regularly assesses the adequacy of current accruals and determines if adjustment of existing accruals, or establishment of new accruals, is required. In the case of income-tax-related contingencies, we monitor tax legislation and court decisions, the status of tax audits and the statute of limitations within which a taxing authority can assert a liability. See Note 21—Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information about income-tax-related contingencies.EnvironmentalWe are subject to the same numerous international, federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations as other companies in our industry. The most significant of these environmental laws and regulations include, among others, the: •U.S. Federal Clean Air Act, which governs air emissions.•U.S. Federal Clean Water Act, which governs discharges to water bodies.56Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements•European Union Regulation for Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH), which governs the manufacture, placing on the market or use of chemicals.•U.S. Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), which imposes liability on generators, transporters and arrangers of hazardous substances at sites where hazardous substance releases have occurred or are threatening to occur.•U.S. Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), which governs the treatment, storage and disposal of solid waste.•U.S. Federal Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA), which requires facilities to report toxic chemical inventories to local emergency planning committees and response departments.•U.S. Federal Safe Drinking Water Act, which governs the disposal of wastewater in underground injection wells.•U.S. Federal Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA90), under which owners and operators of onshore facilities and pipelines as well as owners and operators of vessels are liable for removal costs and damages that result from a discharge of oil into navigable waters of the United States.•European Union Trading Directive resulting in the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS), which uses a market-based mechanism to incentivize the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.These laws and their implementing regulations set limits on emissions and, in the case of discharges to water, establish water quality limits. They also, in most cases, require permits in association with new or modified operations. These permits can require an applicant to collect substantial information in connection with the application process, which can be expensive and time consuming. In addition, there can be delays associated with notice and comment periods and the agency’s processing of the application. Many of the delays associated with the permitting process are beyond the control of the applicant.Many states and foreign countries where we operate also have, or are developing, similar environmental laws and regulations governing these same types of activities. While similar, in some cases these regulations may impose additional, or more stringent, requirements that can add to the cost and difficulty of marketing or transporting products across state and international borders.The ultimate financial impact arising from environmental laws and regulations is neither clearly known nor easily determinable as new standards, such as air emission standards, water quality standards and stricter fuel regulations, continue to evolve. However, environmental laws and regulations, including those that may arise to address concerns about global climate change, are expected to continue to have an increasing impact on our operations in the United States and in other countries in which we operate. Notable areas of potential impacts include air emission compliance and remediation obligations in the United States.An example of this in the fuels area is the Energy Policy Act of 2005, which imposed obligations to provide increasing volumes of renewable fuels in transportation motor fuels through 2012. These obligations were changed with the enactment of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA). EISA requires fuel producers and importers to provide additional renewable fuels for transportation motor fuels and stipulates a mix of various types to be included through 2022. We have met the increasingly stringent requirements to date while establishing implementation, operating and capital strategies, along with advanced technology development, to address projected future requirements. It is uncertain how various future requirements contained in EISA, and the regulations promulgated thereunder, may be implemented and what their full impact may be on our operations. For the 2016 compliance year, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) will require greater volumes of advanced and total renewable fuel than mandated in previous years; it is uncertain if these increased obligations will be achievable by fuel producers and shippers without drawing on the Renewable Identification Number (RIN) bank. For compliance years after 2016, we do not know whether the EPA will utilize its authority to reduce statutory volumes. Additionally, we may experience a decrease in demand for refined petroleum products due to the regulatory program as currently promulgated. This program continues to be the subject of possible Congressional review and re-promulgation in revised form, and the EPA’s recently enacted regulations pertaining to the 2014, 2015, and 2016 compliance years are subject to legal challenge, further creating uncertainty regarding renewable fuel volume requirements and obligations. The EPA’s Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) program was also implemented in accordance with the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and EISA. The RFS program sets annual quotas for the percentage of biofuels (such as ethanol) that must be blended into motor fuels consumed in the United States. A RIN represents a serial number assigned to each gallon of biofuel produced or imported into the United States. As a producer of petroleum-based motor fuels, we are obligated to 57Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statementsblend biofuels into the products we produce at a rate that is at least equal to the EPA’s quota and, to the extent we do not, we must purchase RINs in the open market to satisfy our obligation under the RFS program. The market for RINs has been the subject of fraudulent activity, and we have identified that we have unknowingly purchased RINs in the past that were invalid due to fraudulent activity of third parties. Costs to replace fraudulently marketed RINs that have been determined to be invalid have not been material through December 31, 2015; however, it is reasonably possible that some additional RINs that we have previously purchased may also be determined to be invalid. Should that occur, we could incur additional replacement charges. Although the cost for replacing any additional fraudulently marketed RINs is not reasonably estimable at this time, we could have a possible exposure of approximately $150 million before tax. It could take several years for this possible exposure to reach ultimate resolution; therefore, we would not expect to incur the full financial impact of additional fraudulent RINs replacement costs in any single interim or annual period.We also are subject to certain laws and regulations relating to environmental remediation obligations associated with current and past operations. Such laws and regulations include CERCLA and RCRA and their state equivalents. Remediation obligations include cleanup responsibility arising from petroleum releases from underground storage tanks located at numerous past and present owned and/or operated petroleum-marketing outlets throughout the United States. Federal and state laws require contamination caused by such underground storage tank releases be assessed and remediated to meet applicable standards. In addition to other cleanup standards, many states have adopted cleanup criteria for methyl tertiary-butyl ether (MTBE) for both soil and groundwater.At RCRA-permitted facilities, we are required to assess environmental conditions. If conditions warrant, we may be required to remediate contamination caused by prior operations. In contrast to CERCLA, which is often referred to as “Superfund,” the cost of corrective action activities under RCRA corrective action programs typically is borne solely by us. We anticipate increased expenditures for RCRA remediation activities may be required, but such annual expenditures for the near term are not expected to vary significantly from the range of such expenditures we have experienced over the past few years. Longer-term expenditures are subject to considerable uncertainty and may fluctuate significantly.We occasionally receive requests for information or notices of potential liability from the EPA and state environmental agencies alleging that we are a potentially responsible party under CERCLA or an equivalent state statute. On occasion, we also have been made a party to cost recovery litigation by those agencies or by private parties. These requests, notices and lawsuits assert potential liability for remediation costs at various sites that typically are not owned by us, but allegedly contain wastes attributable to our past operations. As of December 31, 2014, we reported that we had been notified of potential liability under CERCLA and comparable state laws at 34 sites within the United States. During 2015, we were notified of four new sites, settled and closed one site, and resolved one site, leaving 36 unresolved sites with potential liability at December 31, 2015. For most Superfund sites, our potential liability will be significantly less than the total site remediation costs because the percentage of waste attributable to us, versus that attributable to all other potentially responsible parties, is relatively low. Although liability of those potentially responsible is generally joint and several for federal sites and frequently so for state sites, other potentially responsible parties at sites where we are a party typically have had the financial strength to meet their obligations, and where they have not, or where potentially responsible parties could not be located, our share of liability has not increased materially. Many of the sites for which we are potentially responsible are still under investigation by the EPA or the state agencies concerned. Prior to actual cleanup, those potentially responsible normally assess site conditions, apportion responsibility and determine the appropriate remediation. In some instances, we may have no liability or attain a settlement of liability. Actual cleanup costs generally occur after the parties obtain EPA or equivalent state agency approval of a remediation plan. There are relatively few sites where we are a major participant, and given the timing and amounts of anticipated expenditures, neither the cost of remediation at those sites nor such costs at all CERCLA sites, in the aggregate, is expected to have a material adverse effect on our competitive or financial condition.Expensed environmental costs were $581 million in 2015 and are expected to be approximately $655 million in each of the years 2016 and 2017. Capitalized environmental costs were $330 million in 2015 and are expected to be approximately $235 million in each of the years 2016 and 2017. This amount does not include capital expenditures made for another purpose that have an indirect benefit on environmental compliance.Accrued liabilities for remediation activities are not reduced for potential recoveries from insurers or other third parties and are not discounted (except those assumed in a purchase business combination, which we record on a discounted basis).58Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsMany of these liabilities result from CERCLA, RCRA and similar state laws that require us to undertake certain investigative and remedial activities at sites where we conduct, or once conducted, operations or at sites where our generated waste was disposed. We also have accrued for a number of sites we identified that may require environmental remediation, but which are not currently the subject of CERCLA, RCRA or state enforcement activities. If applicable, we accrue receivables for probable insurance or other third-party recoveries. In the future, we may incur significant costs under both CERCLA and RCRA. Remediation activities vary substantially in duration and cost from site to site, depending on the mix of unique site characteristics, evolving remediation technologies, diverse regulatory agencies and enforcement policies, and the presence or absence of potentially liable third parties. Therefore, it is difficult to develop reasonable estimates of future site remediation costs.At December 31, 2015, our balance sheet included total accrued environmental costs of $485 million, compared with $496 million at December 31, 2014, and $492 million at December 31, 2013. We expect to incur a substantial amount of these expenditures within the next 30 years. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, and as with other companies engaged in similar businesses, environmental costs and liabilities are inherent concerns in our operations and products, and there can be no assurance that material costs and liabilities will not be incurred. However, we currently do not expect any material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position as a result of compliance with current environmental laws and regulations.Climate ChangeThere has been a broad range of proposed or promulgated state, national and international laws focusing on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction, including various regulations proposed or issued by the EPA. These proposed or promulgated laws apply or could apply in states and/or countries where we have interests or may have interests in the future. We consider and take into account future GHG emissions in designing and developing major facilities and projects, and implement energy efficiency initiatives to reduce such emissions. Laws regulating GHG emissions continue to evolve, and while it is not possible to accurately estimate either a timetable for implementation or our future compliance costs relating to implementation, such laws, if enacted, potentially could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition as a result of increasing costs of compliance, lengthening project implementation and agency review items, or reducing demand for certain hydrocarbon products. Examples of legislation or precursors for possible regulation that do or could affect our operations include: •EU ETS, which is part of the European Union’s policy to combat climate change and is a key tool for reducing industrial greenhouse gas emissions. EU ETS impacts factories, power stations and other installations across all EU member states. •California’s Global Warming Solutions Act, which requires the California Air Resources Board to develop regulations and market mechanisms that will target reduction of California’s GHG emissions by 25 percent by 2020. Other GHG emissions programs in the western U.S. states have been enacted or are in the process of development, including amendments to California's Low Carbon Fuel Standard, Oregon's Low Carbon Fuel Standard, and Washington's cap and trade program.•The U.S. Supreme Court decision in Massachusetts v. EPA, 549 U.S. 497, 127 S. Ct. 1438 (2007), confirming that the EPA has the authority to regulate carbon dioxide as an “air pollutant” under the Federal Clean Air Act.•The EPA’s announcement on March 29, 2010 (published as “Interpretation of Regulations that Determine Pollutants Covered by Clean Air Act Permitting Programs,” 75 Fed. Reg. 17004 (April 2, 2010)), and the EPA’s and U.S. Department of Transportation’s joint promulgation of a Final Rule on April 1, 2010, that triggers regulation of GHGs under the Clean Air Act. These collectively may lead to more climate-based claims for damages, and may result in longer agency review time for development projects to determine the extent of potential climate change. •EPA's 2015 Final Rule regulating GHG emissions from existing fossil fuel-fired electrical generating units under the Federal Clean Air Act, commonly referred to as the Clean Power Plan.•Carbon taxes in certain jurisdictions.•GHG emission cap and trade programs in certain jurisdictions.In the EU, the first phase of the EU ETS completed at the end of 2007 and Phase II was undertaken from 2008 through to 2012. The current phase (Phase III) runs from 2013 through to 2020, with the main changes being reduced allocation of 59Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statementsfree allowances and increased auctioning of new allowances. Phillips 66 has assets that are subject to the EU ETS, and the company is actively engaged in minimizing any financial impact from the EU ETS.From November 30 to December 12, 2015, more than 190 countries, including the United States, participated in the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris, France. The conference culminated in what is known as the “Paris Agreement,” which is currently open for agreement by countries until April 22, 2016. The Paris Agreement establishes a commitment by signatory parties to pursue domestic GHG emission reductions. In the United States, some additional form of regulation is likely to be forthcoming in the future at the federal or state levels with respect to GHG emissions. Such regulation could take any of several forms that may result in the creation of additional costs in the form of taxes, the restriction of output, investments of capital to maintain compliance with laws and regulations, or required acquisition or trading of emission allowances. We are working to continuously improve operational and energy efficiency through resource and energy conservation throughout our operations.Compliance with changes in laws and regulations that create a GHG emission trading program or GHG reduction requirements could significantly increase our costs, reduce demand for fossil energy derived products, impact the cost and availability of capital and increase our exposure to litigation. Such laws and regulations could also increase demand for less carbon intensive energy sources. An example of one such program is California’s cap and trade program, which was promulgated pursuant to the State’s Global Warming Solutions Act. The program had been limited to certain stationary sources, which include our refineries in California, but beginning in January 2015 expanded to include emissions from transportation fuels distributed in California. Inclusion of transportation fuels in California’s cap and trade program as currently promulgated has increased our cap and trade program compliance costs. The ultimate impact on our financial performance, either positive or negative, from this and similar programs, will depend on a number of factors, including, but not limited to: •Whether and to what extent legislation or regulation is enacted.•The nature of the legislation or regulation (such as a cap and trade system or a tax on emissions).•The GHG reductions required.•The price and availability of offsets.•The amount and allocation of allowances.•Technological and scientific developments leading to new products or services.•Any potential significant physical effects of climate change (such as increased severe weather events, changes in sea levels and changes in temperature).•Whether, and the extent to which, increased compliance costs are ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services.CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATESThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to select appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. See Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for descriptions of our major accounting policies. Certain of these accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent that there is a reasonable likelihood that materially different amounts would have been reported under different conditions, or if different assumptions had been used. The following discussion of critical accounting estimates, along with the discussion of contingencies in this report, address all important accounting areas where the nature of accounting estimates or assumptions could be material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change.ImpairmentsLong-lived assets used in operations are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate a possible significant deterioration in future cash flows is expected to be generated by an asset group. If, upon review, the sum of the undiscounted pre-tax cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset group, including applicable 60Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statementsliabilities, the carrying value of the long-lived assets included in the asset group is written down to estimated fair value. Individual assets are grouped for impairment purposes based on a judgmental assessment of the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets (for example, at a refinery complex level). Because there usually is a lack of quoted market prices for long-lived assets, the fair value of impaired assets is typically determined using one or more of the following methods: the present values of expected future cash flows using discount rates and other assumptions believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants; a market multiple of earnings for similar assets; or historical market transactions of similar assets, adjusted using principal market participant assumptions when necessary. The expected future cash flows used for impairment reviews and related fair value calculations are based on judgmental assessments of future volumes, commodity prices, operating costs, margins, discount rates and capital project decisions, considering all available information at the date of review.Investments in nonconsolidated entities accounted for under the equity method are reviewed for impairment when there are indicators of a loss in value, such as a lack of sustained earnings capacity or a current fair value less than the investment’s carrying amount. When it is determined that an indicated impairment is other than temporary, a charge is recognized for the difference between the investment’s carrying value and its estimated fair value. When determining whether a decline in value is other than temporary, management considers factors such as the length of time and extent of the decline, the investee’s financial condition and near-term prospects, and our ability and intention to retain our investment for a period that allows for recovery. When quoted market prices are not available, the fair value is usually based on the present value of expected future cash flows using discount rates and other assumptions believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants and a market analysis of comparable assets, if appropriate. Differing assumptions could affect the timing and the amount of an impairment of an investment in any period.Asset Retirement ObligationsUnder various contracts, permits and regulations, we have legal obligations to remove tangible equipment and restore the land at the end of operations at certain operational sites. Our largest asset removal obligations involve asbestos abatement at refineries. Estimating the timing and amount of payments for future asset removal costs is difficult. Most of these removal obligations are many years, or decades, in the future, and the contracts and regulations often have vague descriptions of what removal practices and criteria must be met when the removal event actually occurs. Asset removal technologies and costs, regulatory and other compliance considerations, expenditure timing, and other inputs into valuation of the obligation, including discount and inflation rates, are also subject to change.Environmental CostsIn addition to asset retirement obligations discussed above, under the above or similar contracts, permits and regulations, we have certain obligations to complete environmental-related projects. These projects are primarily related to cleanup at domestic refineries, underground storage sites and non-operated sites. Future environmental remediation costs are difficult to estimate because they are subject to change due to such factors as the uncertain magnitude of cleanup costs, the unknown time and extent of such remedial actions that may be required, and the determination of our liability in proportion to that of other responsible parties.Intangible Assets and GoodwillAt December 31, 2015, we had $770 million of intangible assets determined to have indefinite useful lives, and thus they are not amortized. This judgmental assessment of an indefinite useful life must be continuously evaluated in the future. If, due to changes in facts and circumstances, management determines these intangible assets have finite useful lives, amortization will commence at that time on a prospective basis. As long as these intangible assets are judged to have indefinite lives, they will be subject to annual impairment tests that require management’s judgment of the estimated fair value of these intangible assets.At December 31, 2015, we had $3.3 billion of goodwill recorded in conjunction with past business combinations. Goodwill is not amortized. Instead, goodwill is subject to at least annual reviews for impairment at a reporting unit level. The reporting unit or units used to evaluate and measure goodwill for impairment are determined primarily from the manner in which the business is managed. A reporting unit is an operating segment or a component that is one level below an operating segment.61Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsBecause quoted market prices for our reporting units are not available, management applies judgment in determining the estimated fair values of the reporting units for purposes of performing the goodwill impairment test. Management uses all available information to make this fair value determination, including observed market earnings multiples of comparable companies, our common stock price and associated total company market capitalization and the present values of expected future cash flows using discount rates commensurate with the risks associated with the assets. Sales or dispositions of significant assets within a reporting unit are allocated a portion of that reporting unit’s goodwill, based on relative fair values, which impacts the amount of gain or loss on the sale or disposition.We completed our annual impairment test, as of October 1, 2015, and concluded that the fair value of our reporting units exceeded their recorded net book values (including goodwill). The fair values of each of our Refining, Transportation and M&S reporting units exceeded their respective recorded net book values by over 100 percent. However, a decline in the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting units in the future could result in an impairment. For example, a prolonged or significant decline in our stock price or a significant decline in actual or forecasted earnings could provide evidence of a significant decline in fair value and a need to record a material impairment of goodwill for one or more of our reporting units. After we’ve completed our annual test, we continue to monitor for impairment indicators, which can lead to further goodwill impairment testing.Tax Assets and LiabilitiesOur operations are subject to various taxes, including federal, state and foreign income taxes, property taxes, and transactional taxes such as excise, sales/use and payroll taxes. We record tax liabilities based on our assessment of existing tax laws and regulations. The recording of tax liabilities requires significant judgment and estimates. We recognize the financial statement effects of an income tax position when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination by a taxing authority. A contingent liability related to a transactional tax claim is recorded if the loss is both probable and estimable. Actual incurred tax liabilities can vary from our estimates for a variety of reasons, including different interpretations of tax laws and regulations and different assessments of the amount of tax due.In determining our income tax provision, we assess the likelihood our deferred tax assets will be recovered through future taxable income. Valuation allowances reduce deferred tax assets to an amount that will, more likely than not, be realized. Judgment is required in estimating the amount of valuation allowance, if any, that should be recorded against our deferred tax assets. Based on our historical taxable income, our expectations for the future, and available tax-planning strategies, we expect the net deferred tax assets will more likely than not be realized as offsets to reversing deferred tax liabilities and as reductions to future taxable income. If our actual results of operations differ from such estimates or our estimates of future taxable income change, the valuation allowance may need to be revised.New tax laws and regulations, as well as changes to existing tax laws and regulations, are continuously being proposed or promulgated. The implementation of future legislative and regulatory tax initiatives could result in increased tax liabilities that cannot be predicted at this time.Projected Benefit Obligations Determination of the projected benefit obligations for our defined benefit pension and postretirement plans impacts the obligations on the balance sheet and the amount of benefit expense in the income statement. The actuarial determination of projected benefit obligations and company contribution requirements involves judgment about uncertain future events, including estimated retirement dates, salary levels at retirement, mortality rates, lump-sum election rates, rates of return on plan assets, future health care cost-trend rates, and rates of utilization of health care services by retirees. Due to the specialized nature of these calculations, we engage outside actuarial firms to assist in the determination of these projected benefit obligations and company contribution requirements. Due to differing objectives and requirements between financial accounting rules and the pension plan funding regulations promulgated by governmental agencies, the actuarial methods and assumptions for the two purposes differ in certain important respects. Ultimately, we will be required to fund all promised benefits under pension and postretirement benefit plans not funded by plan assets or investment returns, but the judgmental assumptions used in the actuarial calculations significantly affect periodic financial statements and funding patterns over time. Benefit expense is particularly sensitive to the discount rate and return on plan assets assumptions. A 1 percentage-point decrease in the discount rate assumption would increase annual benefit expense by an estimated $60 million, while a 1 percentage-point decrease in the return on plan assets assumption would increase annual benefit expense by an estimated $30 million. In determining the discount rate, we use yields on high-quality fixed income investments with payments matched to the estimated distributions of benefits from our plans.62Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsIn 2015 and 2014, the company used an expected long-term rate of return of 7 percent for the U.S. pension plan assets, which account for 73 percent of the company’s pension plan assets. The actual asset returns were a loss of less than 1 percent in 2015 and a gain of 9 percent in 2014. For the past ten years, actual returns averaged 7 percent for the U.S. pension plan assets.NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDSIn January 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standard Update (ASU) No. 2016-01, “Financial Instruments-Overall (Subtopic 825-10),” to meet its objective of providing more decision-useful information about financial instruments. The majority of this ASU’s provisions amend only the presentation or disclosures of financial instruments; however, one provision will also affect net income. Equity investments carried under the cost method or lower of cost or fair value method of accounting, in accordance with current generally accepted accounting principles, will have to be carried at fair value upon adoption of ASU 2016-01, with changes in fair value recorded in net income. For equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values, a company may elect to carry such investments at cost less impairments, if any, adjusted up or down for price changes in similar financial instruments issued by the investee, when and if observed. Public business entities should apply the guidance in ASU 2016-01 for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those annual periods, with early adoption prohibited. We are currently evaluating the provisions of ASU 2016-01 and assessing the impact, if any, it may have on our financial position and results of operations.In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17, “Income Taxes - Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes.” The new update will simplify the presentation of deferred income taxes and will require deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. The classification shall be made at the tax-paying component level of an entity, after reflecting any offset of deferred tax liabilities, deferred tax assets and any related valuation allowances. Public business entities should apply the guidance in ASU 2015-17 for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. Early application for public entities is permitted. The amendments can be applied either prospectively to all deferred tax liabilities and assets or retrospectively to all periods presented. We are currently evaluating the provisions of ASU 2015-17.In June 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-10, “Development Stage Entities (Topic 915).” The new standard removes the definition of a development stage entity from the Master Glossary of Accounting Standard Codification and the related financial reporting requirements specific to development stage entities. This ASU is intended to reduce cost and complexity of financial reporting for entities that have not commenced planned principal operations. For financial reporting requirements other than the VIE guidance in ASC Topic 810, “Consolidation,” ASU 2014-10 was effective for annual and quarterly reporting periods of public entities beginning after December 15, 2014. For the financial reporting requirements related to VIEs in ASC Topic 810, “Consolidation,” ASU 2014-10 is effective for annual and quarterly reporting periods of public entities beginning after December 15, 2015. Early application for public entities is permitted. We are currently evaluating the provisions of ASU 2014-10. Our preliminary assessment indicates that additional disclosures related to VIEs may be required for our joint ventures if the planned principal operations have not commenced.In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606).” The new standard converged guidance on recognizing revenues in contracts with customers under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and International Financial Reporting Standards. This ASU is intended to improve comparability of revenue recognition practices across entities, industries, jurisdictions and capital markets. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date.” The amendment in this ASU defers the effective date of ASU 2014-09 for all entities for one year. Public business entities should apply the guidance in ASU 2014-09 to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. Earlier adoption is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 31, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. Retrospective or modified retrospective application of the accounting standard is required. We are currently evaluating the provisions of ASU 2014-09 and assessing the impact, if any, it may have on our financial position and results of operations. As part of our assessment work to-date, we have formed an implementation work team, completed training of the new ASU’s revenue recognition model and begun contract review and documentation.63Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsItem 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKFinancial Instrument Market RiskWe and certain of our subsidiaries hold and issue derivative contracts and financial instruments that expose our cash flows or earnings to changes in commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates. We may use financial- and commodity-based derivative contracts to manage the risks produced by changes in the prices of crude oil and related products, natural gas, NGL, and electric power; fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates; or to capture market opportunities.Our use of derivative instruments is governed by an “Authority Limitations” document approved by our Board of Directors that prohibits the use of highly leveraged derivatives or derivative instruments without sufficient market liquidity for comparable valuations. The Authority Limitations document also establishes the Value at Risk (VaR) limits for us, and compliance with these limits is monitored daily. Our Chief Financial Officer monitors risks resulting from foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. Our President monitors commodity price risk. The Commercial organization manages our commercial marketing, optimizes our commodity flows and positions, and monitors related risks of our businesses.Commodity Price RiskWe sell into or receive supply from the worldwide crude oil, refined products, natural gas, NGL, and electric power markets, exposing our revenues, purchases, cost of operating activities, and cash flows to fluctuations in the prices for these commodities. Generally, our policy is to remain exposed to the market prices of commodities. Consistent with this policy, our Commercial organization uses derivative contracts to effectively convert our exposure from fixed-price sales contracts, often requested by refined product customers, back to fluctuating market prices. Conversely, our Commercial organization also uses futures, forwards, swaps and options in various markets to accomplish the following objectives to optimize the value of our supply chain, and this may reduce our exposure to fluctuations in market prices:•In addition to cash settlement prior to contract expiration, exchange-traded futures contracts may be settled by physical delivery of the commodity. This provides another source of supply to balance physical systems or to meet our refinery requirements and marketing demand.•Manage the risk to our cash flows from price exposures on specific crude oil, refined product, natural gas, NGL, and electric power transactions.•Enable us to use the market knowledge gained from these activities to capture market opportunities such as moving physical commodities to more profitable locations, storing commodities to capture seasonal or time premiums, and blending commodities to capture quality upgrades. Derivatives may be utilized to optimize these activities.We use a VaR model to estimate the loss in fair value that could potentially result on a single day from the effect of adverse changes in market conditions on the derivative financial instruments and derivative commodity instruments held or issued, including commodity purchase and sales contracts recorded on the balance sheet at December 31, 2015, as derivative instruments. Using Monte Carlo simulation, a 95 percent confidence level and a one-day holding period, the VaR for those instruments issued or held for trading purposes at December 31, 2015 and 2014, was immaterial to our cash flows and net income.The VaR for instruments held for purposes other than trading at December 31, 2015 and 2014, was also immaterial to our cash flows and net income.64Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsInterest Rate RiskThe following tables provide information about our debt instruments that are sensitive to changes in U.S. interest rates. These tables present principal cash flows and related weighted-average interest rates by expected maturity dates. Weighted-average variable rates are based on effective rates at the reporting date. The carrying amount of our floating-rate debt approximates its fair value. The fair value of the fixed-rate financial instruments is estimated based on quoted market prices.

Readers are cautioned that such forward-looking statements should be read in conjunction with the company’s disclosures under the heading: “CAUTIONARY STATEMENT FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE ‘SAFE HARBOR’ PROVISIONS OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995.” The terms “earnings” and “loss” as used in Management’s Discussion and Analysis refer to net income (loss) attributable to Phillips 66.BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND EXECUTIVE OVERVIEWPhillips 66 is an energy manufacturing and logistics company with midstream, chemicals, refining, and marketing and specialties businesses. At December 31, 2016, we had total assets of $51.7 billion.Executive OverviewWe reported earnings of $1.6 billion in 2016 and generated $3.0 billion in cash from operating activities. Phillips 66 Partners LP issued debt and common units to the public for net proceeds totaling $2.1 billion. We used this available cash primarily to fund capital expenditures and investments of $2.8 billion, pay dividends of $1.3 billion and repurchase $1.0 billion of our common stock. We ended 2016 with $2.7 billion of cash and cash equivalents and approximately $5.5 billion of total capacity under both our and Phillips 66 Partners’ available liquidity facilities. Our financial performance in 2016 demonstrated the benefit of a diversified portfolio of businesses in a low commodity price environment. We continue to focus on the following strategic priorities:•Operating Excellence. Our commitment to operating excellence guides everything we do. We are committed to protecting the health and safety of everyone who has a role in our operations and the communities in which we operate. Continuous improvement in safety, environmental stewardship, reliability and cost efficiency is a fundamental requirement for our company and employees. We employ rigorous training and audit programs to drive ongoing improvement in both personal and process safety as we strive for zero incidents. 2016 was our safest year since the company’s inception. Since we cannot control commodity prices, controlling operating expenses and overhead costs, within the context of our commitment to safety and environmental stewardship, is a high priority. We actively monitor and report these costs to senior management. Our operating and selling, general and administrative expenses were $5.9 billion in 2016, $6.0 billion in 2015 and $6.1 billion in 2014. We are committed to protecting the environment and strive to reduce our environmental footprint throughout our operations. Optimizing utilization rates at our refineries through reliable and safe operations enables us to capture the value available in the market in terms of prices and margins. During 2016, our worldwide refining crude oil capacity utilization rate was 96 percent, 5 percent higher than during 2015.•Growth. We have budgeted $2.7 billion in capital expenditures and investments in 2017, including $0.4 billion for Phillips 66 Partners. Including our share of expected capital spending by joint ventures DCP Midstream, LLC (DCP Midstream), Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC (CPChem) and WRB Refining LP (WRB), our total 2017 capital program is expected to be $3.8 billion. After completing our U.S. Gulf Coast NGL market hub in 2016, we will focus Midstream development in 2017 around our existing infrastructure’s footprint. In Chemicals, CPChem progressed towards completion of its U.S. Gulf Coast ethane cracker and polyethylene facilities project during 2016. The polyethylene units are expected to be complete by mid-2017 and the ethane 30Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statementscracker is expected to be complete in the fourth quarter of 2017. Growth capital in Refining will be directed toward small, high-return, quick-payout projects, while Marketing and Specialties will continue to expand and enhance its fuels marketing business.•Returns. We plan to improve refining returns by increasing throughput of advantaged feedstocks, disciplined capital allocation and portfolio optimization. A disciplined capital allocation process ensures that we focus investments in projects that generate competitive returns throughout the business cycle. During 2016, we sold the Whitegate Refinery in Ireland as part of our ongoing portfolio optimization process. We improved clean product yield in 2016, and continued efforts to enhance the value of our marketing brands.•Distributions. We believe shareholder value is enhanced through, among other things, consistent growth of regular dividends, supplemented by share repurchases. We increased our quarterly dividend rate by 13 percent during 2016, and have increased it 215 percent since our separation from ConocoPhillips in 2012 (the Separation). Regular dividends demonstrate the confidence our Board of Directors and management have in our capital structure and operations’ capability to generate free cash flow throughout the business cycle. In 2016, we repurchased $1.0 billion, or approximately 12.9 million shares, of our common stock. At the discretion of our Board of Directors, we plan to increase dividends annually and fund our share repurchase program while continuing to invest in the growth of our business. •High-Performing Organization. We strive to attract, develop and retain individuals with the knowledge and skills to implement our business strategy and who support our values and culture. Throughout the company, we focus on getting results in the right way and believe success is both what we do and how we do it. We encourage collaboration throughout our company, while valuing differences, respecting diversity, and creating a great place to work. We foster an environment of learning and development through structured programs focused on enhancing functional and technical skills where employees are engaged in our business and committed to their own, as well as the company’s, success. 31Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsBusiness EnvironmentCommodity prices remained compressed during 2016. The discount for U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) versus the international benchmark Brent narrowed over much of 2016 as the reemergence of floating storage pressured prompt waterborne markets. Over the course of 2016, commodity prices had a variety of impacts, both favorable and unfavorable, on our businesses that vary by segment. Earnings in the Midstream segment, which includes our 50 percent equity investment in DCP Midstream, are closely linked to NGL prices, natural gas prices and crude oil prices. Average natural gas prices in 2016 were slightly lower than 2015 due to warmer-than-normal temperatures and high storage. In the fourth quarter of 2016, natural gas prices gained momentum with colder temperatures and increased residential and commercial heating demand. Total U.S. dry natural gas production also increased through the fourth quarter of 2016, largely from the Marcellus play, where new pipeline takeaway capacity came online in December 2016. NGL prices improved slightly throughout 2016 due to an increase in export capacity in the United States. During 2016, our Chemicals segment, which consists of our 50 percent equity investment in CPChem, continued to benefit from feedstock cost advantages associated with manufacturing ethylene in regions of the world with significant NGL production. The chemicals and plastics industry is mainly a commodity-based industry where the margins for key products are based on supply and demand, as well as cost factors. The petrochemicals industry continues to experience lower ethylene cash costs in regions of the world where ethylene manufacturing is based upon NGL rather than crude oil-derived feedstocks. In particular, companies with North American light NGL-based crackers have benefited from lower-priced feedstocks. The ethylene-to-polyethylene chain margins remained positive, but they compressed in 2016 because of the significant decline in crude oil prices that began in 2014. Our Refining segment results are driven by several factors including refining margins, cost control, refinery throughput and product yields. Refinery margins, often referred to as crack spreads, are measured as the difference between market prices for refined petroleum products and crude oil. During 2016, the U.S. 3:2:1 crack spread (three barrels of crude oil producing two barrels of gasoline and one barrel of diesel) weakened across all quarters compared with 2015, largely attributable to higher product inventories resulting from historically high refining throughput (especially in the Gulf Coast and Midcontinent regions). Northwest European crack spreads on average decreased in 2016 compared to 2015, also because of high product inventories resulting from high refinery utilization. Results for our Marketing and Specialties (M&S) segment depend largely on marketing fuel margins, lubricant margins and other specialty product margins. While M&S margins are primarily based on market factors, largely determined by the relationship between supply and demand, marketing fuel margins, in particular, are influenced by the trend of spot prices for refined products. Generally speaking, a downward trend of spot prices has a favorable impact on marketing fuel margins, while an upward trend of spot prices has an unfavorable impact on marketing fuel margins.32Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsRESULTS OF OPERATIONSConsolidated ResultsA summary of net income (loss) attributable to Phillips 66 by business segment follows: Millions of Dollars Year Ended December 31 2016 2015 2014 Midstream$178 13 507Chemicals583 962 1,137Refining374 2,555 1,771Marketing and Specialties891 1,187 1,034Corporate and Other(471) (490) (393)Income from continuing operations attributable to Phillips 661,555 4,227 4,056Discontinued Operations— — 706Net income attributable to Phillips 66$1,555 4,227 4,7622016 vs. 2015 Our earnings from continuing operations decreased $2,672 million, or 63 percent, in 2016, mainly reflecting: •Lower realized refining margins.•Lower olefins and polyolefins margins.•Recognition in 2015 of $242 million of the deferred gain related to the sale in 2013 of the Immingham Combined Heat and Power Plant (ICHP).These decreases were partially offset by:•Lower equity losses from DCP Midstream, primarily as a result of goodwill and other asset impairments recorded in 2015. 2015 vs. 2014 Our earnings from continuing operations increased $171 million, or 4 percent, in 2015, primarily resulting from: •Improved realized refining margins.•Recognition of $242 million in 2015, compared with $126 million in 2014, of the deferred gain related to the sale in 2013 of ICHP.These increases were partially offset by:•Goodwill and other asset impairments recorded by DCP Midstream in 2015.•Lower ethylene margins. Discontinued operations in 2014 included the recognition of a noncash $696 million gain related to the Phillips Specialty Products Inc. (PSPI) disposition through a share exchange. See the “Segment Results” section for additional information on our segment results.33Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsIncome Statement Analysis2016 vs. 2015 Sales and other operating revenues and purchased crude oil and products both decreased 15 percent in 2016. The decreases were primarily due to lower average prices for petroleum products and crude oil, while average NGL prices were slightly improved during 2016. Equity in earnings of affiliates decreased 10 percent in 2016, primarily resulting from decreased earnings from CPChem and WRB, partially offset by improved results from DCP Midstream.•Equity in earnings of CPChem decreased 37 percent, primarily due to lower realized olefins and polyolefins margins. •Equity in earnings of WRB decreased $186 million, mainly resulting from lower market crack spreads, partially offset by higher feedstock advantage.•Equity in earnings of DCP Midstream improved $426 million in 2016, primarily driven by goodwill and other asset impairments recorded by DCP Midstream in 2015. Net gain on dispositions decreased $273 million in 2016. In 2015, we recognized a $242 million deferred gain related to the sale of ICHP. See Note 6—Assets Held for Sale or Sold, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. See Note 21—Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for information regarding our provision for income taxes and effective tax rates.2015 vs. 2014 Sales and other operating revenues decreased 39 percent in 2015, while purchased crude oil and products decreased 46 percent. The decreases were primarily due to lower average prices for petroleum products, crude oil and NGL.Equity in earnings of affiliates decreased 36 percent in 2015, primarily resulting from decreased earnings from DCP Midstream, CPChem and WRB. •Equity in earnings of DCP Midstream decreased $676 million in 2015. The decrease was primarily due to lower NGL, crude oil and natural gas prices. In addition, DCP Midstream recorded goodwill and other asset impairments in 2015. •Equity in earnings of CPChem decreased 19 percent, primarily due to lower ethylene margins and lower equity earnings from CPChem’s equity affiliates, partially offset by lower utility costs. •Equity in earnings of WRB decreased 13 percent, primarily driven by lower realized refining margins resulting from lower feedstock advantage, partially offset by higher secondary product margins. Impairments in 2015 were $7 million, compared with $150 million in 2014. There was a $131 million impairment of the Whitegate Refinery recorded in 2014. For additional information, see Note 10—Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Interest and debt expense increased 16 percent in 2015. The increase was mainly due to a higher average debt principal balance in 2015, partially offset by increased capitalized interest. See Note 21—Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for information regarding our provision for income taxes and effective tax rates.34Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsSegment ResultsMidstream Year Ended December 31 2016 2015 2014 Millions of DollarsNet Income (Loss) Attributable to Phillips 66 Transportation$246 288 233DCP Midstream(33) (324) 135NGL(35) 49 139Total Midstream$178 13 507 Dollars Per UnitWeighted Average NGL Price* DCP Midstream (per gallon)$0.46 0.45 0.89 *Based on index prices from the Mont Belvieu and Conway market hubs that are weighted by NGL component and location mix.

The Midstream segment gathers, processes, transports and markets natural gas; and transports, stores, fractionates and markets NGL in the United States. In addition, this segment transports crude oil and other feedstocks to our refineries and other locations, delivers refined and specialty products to market, and provides terminaling and storage services for crude oil and petroleum products. The segment also stores, refrigerates, and exports liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) primarily to Asia and Europe. The Midstream segment includes our master limited partnership (MLP), Phillips 66 Partners LP, as well as our 50 percent equity investment in DCP Midstream, LLC, which includes the operations of its MLP, DCP Midstream, LP (formerly named DCP Midstream Partners, LP and referred to herein as DCP Partners).2016 vs. 2015 Earnings from the Midstream segment increased $165 million in 2016, compared with 2015. The increase was primarily due to improved results from DCP Midstream, partially offset by lower earnings from our Transportation and NGL businesses.Transportation earnings decreased $42 million in 2016, compared with 2015. Lower earnings primarily resulted from higher operating costs, and increased depreciation expense due to growth projects, as well as increased income attributable to noncontrolling interests, reflecting the contribution of assets to Phillips 66 Partners. These items were partially offset by higher revenues from increased throughput volumes and higher tariffs. 35Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsResults from our investment in DCP Midstream improved $291 million in 2016, compared with 2015. In 2015, DCP Midstream recorded goodwill and other asset impairments, which reduced our earnings from DCP Midstream by $232 million, after-tax. In addition, favorable contract restructuring efforts, improved asset performance, higher earnings from DCP Midstream’s equity affiliates, lower operating costs and higher NGL prices contributed to better results in 2016. These improvements were partially offset by lower natural gas and crude oil prices. Results from our NGL business decreased $84 million in 2016, compared with 2015. The decrease was primarily driven by lower realized margins, as well as increased depreciation and operating expenses associated with the Sweeny Fractionator and, late in the year, the Freeport LPG Export Terminal. These items were partially offset by higher fractionated volumes, reflecting the operation of the Sweeny Fractionator for a full year in 2016, and the benefit of the first liquefied petroleum gas cargos exported from the Freeport LPG Export Terminal in late 2016. See the “Business Environment and Executive Overview” section for information on market factors impacting 2016 results.2015 vs. 2014 Earnings from the Midstream segment decreased $494 million in 2015, compared with 2014. The decrease was primarily due to lower earnings from DCP Midstream and our NGL business, partially offset by higher earnings from our Transportation business.Transportation earnings increased $55 million in 2015, compared with 2014. This increase reflects the startup of our Bayway and Ferndale crude oil rail unloading facilities in the second half of 2014, as well as a full year of operations from the Beaumont Terminal acquired in 2014. Increased railcar fleet activities, higher terminal revenues, and improved earnings from equity affiliates also benefited earnings in 2015. These benefits were partially offset by higher earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests.Earnings associated with our investment in DCP Midstream decreased $459 million in 2015, compared with 2014. The decrease in 2015 mainly resulted from lower NGL, crude oil, and natural gas prices, partially offset by increased volumes due to asset growth and lower operating costs as a result of cost saving initiatives. In addition, goodwill and other asset impairments recorded by DCP Midstream in 2015 contributed to the loss recognized from our investment in DCP Midstream. DCP Midstream performed a goodwill impairment assessment and other asset impairment assessments based on internal discounted cash flow models taking into account various observable and non-observable factors, such as prices, volumes, expenses and discount rates. The impairment tests resulted in DCP Midstream’s recognition of a $460 million goodwill impairment and $342 million in other asset impairments, net of tax impacts. Together, these impairments reduced our equity earnings from DCP Midstream by $232 million after-tax. DCP Partners periodically issues limited partner units to the public. These issuances benefited our equity in earnings from DCP Midstream, on an after-tax basis, by approximately $1 million in 2015, compared with approximately $45 million in 2014.The earnings from our NGL business decreased $90 million in 2015, compared with 2014. The decrease was primarily driven by lower realized margins and higher earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests. We also incurred higher tax expense in 2015, driven by a lower manufacturing deduction resulting from bonus depreciation associated with the start-up of the Sweeny Fractionator. These decreases were partially offset by higher earnings from equity affiliates.36Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsChemicals Year Ended December 31 2016 2015 2014 Millions of Dollars Net Income Attributable to Phillips 66$583 962 1,137 Millions of PoundsCPChem Externally Marketed Sales Volumes* Olefins and Polyolefins16,011 16,916 16,815Specialties, Aromatics and Styrenics4,911 5,301 6,294 20,922 22,217 23,109*Represents 100 percent of CPChem’s outside sales of produced petrochemical products, as well as commission sales from equity affiliates. Olefins and Polyolefins Capacity Utilization (percent)*91% 92 88*Revised to exclude polyethylene pipe operations. Prior periods recast for comparability. The Chemicals segment consists of our 50 percent interest in CPChem, which we account for under the equity method. CPChem uses NGL and other feedstocks to produce petrochemicals. These products are then marketed and sold or used as feedstocks to produce plastics and other chemicals. We structure our reporting of CPChem’s operations around two primary business segments: Olefins and Polyolefins (O&P) and Specialties, Aromatics and Styrenics (SA&S). The O&P business segment produces and markets ethylene and other olefin products; ethylene produced is primarily consumed within CPChem for the production of polyethylene, normal alpha olefins and polyethylene pipe. The SA&S business segment manufactures and markets aromatics and styrenics products, such as benzene, styrene, paraxylene and cyclohexane, as well as polystyrene and styrene-butadiene copolymers. SA&S also manufactures and/or markets a variety of specialty chemical products. Unless otherwise noted, amounts referenced below reflect our net 50 percent interest in CPChem.2016 vs. 2015 Earnings from the Chemicals segment decreased $379 million, or 39 percent, in 2016, compared with 2015. The decrease in earnings was primarily due to lower realized margins from the O&P business, driven by a decline in sales prices for polyethylene and normal alpha olefins (NAO) and higher feedstock costs, as well as impacts from increased turnaround activity. Lower equity earnings from CPChem’s equity affiliates and lower SA&S volumes further reduced earnings in 2016. In addition, CPChem recognized a $177 million impairment in 2016 due to lower demand and margin factors affecting an equity affiliate, which resulted in an $89 million after-tax reduction in our equity earnings from CPChem. Our equity earnings from CPChem were reduced by $24 million in 2015 as a result of an impairment CPChem recognized on an equity affiliate. These items were partially offset by higher NAO and polyethylene sales volumes and improved SA&S margins. See the “Business Environment and Executive Overview” section for information on market factors impacting CPChem’s results.37Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements2015 vs. 2014Earnings from the Chemicals segment decreased $175 million, or 15 percent, in 2015, compared with 2014. The decrease in earnings was primarily due to lower margins resulting from lower sales prices, lower earnings from CPChem’s O&P equity affiliates, and higher turnaround and maintenance activities. These decreases were partially offset by higher ethylene and polyethylene sales volumes, as well as lower repair costs due to the impact on 2014 costs of a fire at CPChem’s Port Arthur, Texas facility. Lower feedstock costs, lower utility costs due to falling natural gas prices, and lower impairment charges also benefited the 2015 operating results. In July 2014, a localized fire occurred in the olefins unit at CPChem’s Port Arthur, Texas facility, shutting down ethylene production. The Port Arthur ethylene unit restarted in November 2014. CPChem incurred, on a 100 percent basis, $85 million of associated repair and rebuild costs. Because the Port Arthur ethylene unit was down due to the fire, CPChem experienced a significant reduction in production and sales in several of its product lines stemming from the lack of the Port Arthur ethylene supply in 2014. CPChem recorded earnings, on a 100 percent basis, of $88 million and $120 million for business interruption and property damage insurance proceeds in 2015 and 2014, respectively. 38Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsRefining Year Ended December 31 2016 2015 2014 Millions of DollarsNet Income (Loss) Attributable to Phillips 66 Atlantic Basin/Europe$204 569 198Gulf Coast52 551 252Central Corridor234 857 967West Coast(116) 578 354Worldwide$374 2,555 1,771 Dollars Per BarrelRefining Margins Atlantic Basin/Europe$6.26 9.39 8.94Gulf Coast5.49 9.29 7.64Central Corridor8.70 14.88 15.63West Coast9.15 16.86 8.89Worldwide6.99 11.84 9.93 Thousands of Barrels DailyOperating Statistics Refining operations* Atlantic Basin/Europe Crude oil capacity566 588 588Crude oil processed568 539 554Capacity utilization (percent)100% 92 94Refinery production607 587 605Gulf Coast Crude oil capacity743 738 733Crude oil processed704 654 676Capacity utilization (percent)95% 89 92Refinery production783 733 771Central Corridor Crude oil capacity493 492 485Crude oil processed485 465 475Capacity utilization (percent)98% 95 98Refinery production506 486 494West Coast Crude oil capacity360 360 440Crude oil processed318 330 403Capacity utilization (percent)88% 92 92Refinery production345 359 435Worldwide Crude oil capacity2,162 2,178 2,246Crude oil processed2,075 1,988 2,108Capacity utilization (percent)96% 91 94Refinery production2,241 2,165 2,305*Includes our share of equity affiliates. 39Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsThe Refining segment buys, sells and refines crude oil and other feedstocks into petroleum products (such as gasoline, distillates and aviation fuels) at 13 refineries, mainly in the United States and Europe.2016 vs. 2015 Earnings for the Refining segment decreased $2,181 million, compared with 2015. Lower earnings in 2016 reflected lower realized refining margins resulting from decreased market crack spreads, higher costs associated with renewable fuels blending activities, lower clean product differentials and lower feedstock advantage. These items were partially offset by higher volumes due to lower turnaround activities and less unplanned downtime. See the “Business Environment and Executive Overview” section for information on industry crack spreads and other market factors impacting this year’s results.Our worldwide refining crude oil capacity utilization rate was 96 percent in 2016, compared to 91 percent in 2015. The increase was primarily attributable to lower turnaround activities and less unplanned downtime. Merey Sweeny, L.P. (MSLP) owns a delayed coker and related facilities at the Sweeny Refinery. MSLP processes long residue, which is produced from heavy sour crude oil, for a processing fee. Fuel-grade petroleum coke is produced as a by-product and becomes the property of MSLP. As more fully discussed in Note 5—Business Combinations, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in February 2017, the time expired for all legal challenges related to the exercise in 2009 of a call right to acquire Petróleos de Venezuela S.A.’s (PDVSA) 50 percent share of MSLP, and we began accounting for MSLP as a wholly owned consolidated subsidiary. Based on a preliminary appraisal, the acquisition of PDVSA’s 50 percent interest is expected to result in our recording a noncash, pre-tax gain of approximately $420 million in the first quarter of 2017. 2015 vs. 2014 Earnings for the Refining segment increased $784 million, or 44 percent, compared with 2014. The increase in earnings in 2015 primarily resulted from higher realized refining margins due to higher gasoline crack spreads and improved secondary product margins, as well as lower utility costs. These increases were partially offset by lower feedstock advantage, lower distillate crack spreads, lower clean product differentials, and lower refining volumes as a result of higher unplanned downtime and turnaround activities. Our worldwide refining crude oil capacity utilization rate was 91 percent in 2015, compared to 94 percent in 2014. The decrease reflects higher unplanned downtime and turnaround activities. 40Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsMarketing and Specialties Year Ended December 31 2016 2015 2014 Millions of DollarsNet Income Attributable to Phillips 66 Marketing and Other$747 1,004 836Specialties144 183 198Total Marketing and Specialties$891 1,187 1,034 Dollars Per BarrelRealized Marketing Fuel Margin* U.S.$1.64 1.65 1.51International4.05 4.40 5.22*On third-party petroleum products sales.

In addition, this segment includes the manufacturing and marketing of specialty products (such as base oils and lubricants), as well as power generation operations. 2016 vs. 2015 Earnings from the M&S segment decreased $296 million, or 25 percent, in 2016, compared with 2015. The decrease was mainly attributable to the $242 million deferred gain recognized in 2015 related to the 2013 ICHP sale. See Note 6—Assets Held for Sale or Sold, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. Also contributing to the lower earnings in 2016 were lower realized marketing margins driven by an upward trend of spot prices during most of 2016, and lower margins and volumes in lubricants. These decreases were partially offset by favorable tax adjustments and higher marketing volumes. See the “Business Environment and Executive Overview” section for information on marketing fuel margins and other market factors impacting 2016 results.41Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements2015 vs. 2014Earnings from the M&S segment increased $153 million, or 15 percent, in 2015, compared with 2014. In July 2013, we completed the sale of ICHP, and deferred the gain from the sale due to an indemnity provided to the buyer. We recognized $242 million after-tax and $126 million after-tax of the deferred gain in 2015 and 2014, respectively. Earnings from the M&S segment also benefited from higher domestic marketing activities, higher domestic marketing and lubricants volumes, and increased tax credits from biodiesel blending activities. These benefits were partially offset by lower international marketing margins and lubricants margins.

Net interest expense increased $24 million in 2016, compared with 2015, mainly due to lower capitalized interest. The category “Other” includes certain income tax expenses, environmental costs associated with sites no longer in operation, foreign currency transaction gains and losses and other costs not directly associated with an operating segment. The decrease in other costs in 2016 was primarily attributable to favorable tax impacts, the write-off of certain fixed assets during 2015 and the impact of an increase in noncontrolling interests on interest expense incurred by Phillips 66 Partners, partially offset by higher environmental accruals. 2015 vs. 2014Net interest expense increased $26 million in 2015, compared with 2014, primarily due to a higher average debt principal balance as a result of the issuance of debt in the fourth quarter of 2014 and Phillips 66 Partners’ debt issuance in the first quarter of 2015. The increase was partially offset by higher capitalized interest. For additional information, see Note 13—Debt, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.The increase in other costs in 2015 was primarily due to foreign tax credit carryforwards that were utilized in 2014 and other tax adjustments made in 2015. 42Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsDiscontinued Operations Millions of Dollars Year Ended December 31 2016 2015 2014Net Income Attributable to Phillips 66 Discontinued operations$— — 706In December 2013, we entered into an agreement to exchange the stock of PSPI, a flow improver business that was included in our M&S segment, for shares of Phillips 66 common stock owned by the other party to the transaction. In February 2014, we completed the PSPI share exchange, resulting in the receipt of approximately 17.4 million shares of Phillips 66 common stock and the recognition of a before-tax noncash gain of $696 million. See Note 6—Assets Held for Sale or Sold, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information on this transaction.43Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsCAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITYFinancial Indicators Millions of DollarsExcept as Indicated 2016 2015 2014 Cash and cash equivalents$2,711 3,074 5,207 Net cash provided by operating activities2,963 5,713 3,529 Short-term debt550 44 842 Total debt10,138 8,887 8,635 Total equity23,725 23,938 22,037 Percent of total debt to capital*30% 27 28 Percent of floating-rate debt to total debt3% 1 1 *Capital includes total debt and total equity. To meet our short- and long-term liquidity requirements, we look to a variety of funding sources, including cash generated from operating activities and Phillips 66 Partners’ debt and equity financings. During 2016, we generated $3.0 billion in cash from operations. Phillips 66 Partners issued debt and common units to the public for net proceeds totaling $2.1 billion. We used this available cash primarily for capital expenditures and investments ($2.8 billion); repurchases of our common stock ($1.0 billion); and dividend payments on our common stock ($1.3 billion). During 2016, cash and cash equivalents decreased by $0.4 billion, to $2.7 billion.In addition to cash flows from operating activities, we rely on our commercial paper and credit facility programs, asset sales and our ability to issue securities using our shelf registration statement to support our short- and long-term liquidity requirements. We believe current cash and cash equivalents and cash generated by operations, together with access to external sources of funds as described below under “Significant Sources of Capital,” will be sufficient to meet our funding requirements in the near and long term, including our capital spending, dividend payments, defined benefit plan contributions, debt repayment and share repurchases. Significant Sources of CapitalOperating ActivitiesDuring 2016, cash of $2,963 million was provided by operating activities, a 48 percent decrease compared with 2015. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower realized refining margins, as well as a reduction in distributions from our equity affiliates. This decrease was partially offset by positive working capital of $501 million in 2016 compared to a negative working capital impact of $221 million in 2015. The positive working capital impact in 2016 was primarily driven by increased refining payables, due to an increase in feedstock costs at the end of 2016 as compared with 2015, and the timing of tax payments and refunds, partially offset by an increase in receivables, resulting from higher commodity prices. See the following paragraph for a discussion of 2015 working capital effects.During 2015, cash of $5,713 million was provided by operating activities, a 62 percent increase from cash from operations of $3,529 million in 2014. Net income in 2015 was lower than 2014; however, in both years large noncash items affected earnings, including the gain on the PSPI exchange in 2014, recognition in 2015 and 2014 of a deferred gain from a 2013 asset disposition, and goodwill and other asset impairments by DCP Midstream in 2015. Excluding these items, underlying earnings in 2015 were slightly improved compared with 2014, primarily reflecting increased refining margins and increased domestic marketing volumes, partially offset by lower midstream prices. Negative working capital impacted operating cash flow by $221 million and $1,020 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively. The lower negative working capital impact in 2015 was driven by decreased refining payables due to lower feedstock costs in 2015 as compared with 2014, partially offset by a reduction in receivables due to reduced commodity prices. 44Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsOur short- and long-term operating cash flows are highly dependent upon refining and marketing margins, NGL prices and chemicals margins. Prices and margins in our industry are typically volatile, and are driven by market conditions over which we have little or no control. Absent other mitigating factors, as these prices and margins fluctuate, we would expect a corresponding change in our operating cash flows.The level and quality of output from our refineries also impacts our cash flows. Factors such as operating efficiency, maintenance turnarounds, market conditions, feedstock availability and weather conditions can affect output. We actively manage the operations of our refineries, and any variability in their operations typically has not been as significant to cash flows as that caused by margins and prices. Our worldwide refining crude oil capacity utilization was 96 percent in 2016, compared with 91 percent in 2015.Equity AffiliatesOur operating cash flows are also impacted by distribution decisions made by our equity affiliates, including DCP Midstream, CPChem and WRB. Over the three years ended December 31, 2016, we received distributions of $237 million from DCP Midstream, $2,241 million from CPChem and $1,568 million from WRB. We cannot control the amount or timing of future distributions from equity affiliates; therefore, future distributions by these and other equity affiliates are not assured.Effective January 1, 2017, DCP Midstream, LLC and DCP Partners closed a transaction in which DCP Midstream, LLC contributed subsidiaries owning all of its operating assets, $424 million of cash and $3.15 billion of debt to DCP Partners, in exchange for DCP Partners units which had an estimated fair value of $1.125 billion at the time of the transaction. We and our co-venturer retained our 50/50 investment in DCP Midstream, LLC, and DCP Midstream, LLC retained its incentive distribution rights in DCP Partners through its ownership of the general partner of DCP Partners. After the transaction, DCP Midstream, LLC held a 38 percent interest in DCP Partners. DCP Midstream, LLC, through its ownership of the general partner, has agreed, if required, to forgo receipt of incentive distribution rights up to $100 million annually (100 percent basis) through 2019, to support a minimum distribution coverage ratio for DCP Partners. In connection with the transaction, DCP Midstream, LLC terminated its revolving credit agreement, which had previously served to limit distributions to its owners while amounts had been borrowed under the facility. As a result, we expect distributions to the owners of DCP Midstream, LLC to resume in 2017 as it receives distributions from DCP Partners.In 2015, CPChem made a special distribution to its owners, with our share totaling $696 million. CPChem funded the distribution by issuing $1.4 billion of senior notes with maturities ranging from three to five years, with a combination of fixed and variable interest rates. This cash inflow from CPChem was included in operating cash flows, as we had cumulative undistributed equity earnings attributable to CPChem in excess of the amount distributed. CPChem’s U.S. Gulf Coast project is expected to be completed and begin commercial operations during 2017. As a result, we expect distributions from CPChem to increase starting in 2017, as capital spending by CPChem on this project ends. WRB is a 50-percent-owned business venture with Cenovus Energy Inc. (Cenovus). Cenovus was obligated to contribute $7.5 billion, plus accrued interest, to WRB over a 10-year period that began in 2007. In 2014, Cenovus prepaid its remaining balance under this obligation. As a result, WRB declared a special dividend, which was distributed to the co-venturers in 2014. Of the $1,232 million that we received, $760 million was considered a return on our investment in WRB (an operating cash inflow), and $472 million was considered a return of our investment in WRB (an investing cash inflow). The return-of-investment portion of the dividend was included in the “Proceeds from asset dispositions” line in our consolidated statement of cash flows. A further $129 million of distributions from WRB during 2014 was considered a return of investment.Asset SalesNet proceeds from asset sales in 2016 were $156 million compared with $70 million in 2015 and $1,244 million in 2014. The 2016 net proceeds were primarily attributed to the sale of the Whitegate Refinery in Ireland. The 2015 net proceeds were attributed to the sale of the Bantry Bay terminal in Ireland and the sale of certain retail sites in Kansas and Missouri, and were partially offset by a working capital true-up related to the 2014 sale of our interest in the Malaysia Refining Company Sdn. Bdh. (MRC). The 2014 proceeds included a portion of the WRB special dividend as discussed above, as well as the sale of our interest in MRC. 45Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsForeign Cash HoldingsAt December 31, 2016, approximately 53 percent of our consolidated cash and cash equivalents balance was available to fund domestic opportunities without incurring material U.S. income taxes in excess of the amounts already accrued in the financial statements. We believe the remaining amount, primarily attributable to cash we hold in foreign locations where we have asserted our intention to indefinitely reinvest earnings, does not materially affect our consolidated liquidity due to the following factors:•A substantial portion of our foreign cash supports the liquidity needs and regulatory requirements of our foreign operations.•We have the ability to fund a significant portion of our domestic capital requirements with cash provided by domestic operating activities.•We have access to U.S. capital markets through our $5 billion committed revolving credit facility, commercial paper program, and universal shelf registration statement.See Note 21—Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information on income taxes associated with foreign earnings.Phillips 66 Partners LPIn 2013 we formed Phillips 66 Partners LP, a publicly traded master limited partnership, to own, operate, develop and acquire primarily fee-based crude oil, refined petroleum product, and NGL pipelines and terminals, as well as other Midstream assets.OwnershipAt December 31, 2016, we owned a 59 percent limited partner interest and a 2 percent general partner interest in Phillips 66 Partners, while its public unitholders owned a 39 percent limited partner interest. We consolidate Phillips 66 Partners as a variable interest entity for financial reporting purposes. See Note 3—Variable Interest Entities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information on why we consolidate the partnership. As a result of this consolidation, the public unitholders’ ownership interest in Phillips 66 Partners is reflected as a $1,306 million noncontrolling interest in our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2016. Generally, drop down transactions to Phillips 66 Partners will eliminate in consolidation, except for third-party debt or equity offerings made by Phillips 66 Partners to finance such transactions. Through the public offerings of common units and senior notes discussed below, our consolidated cash increased by $2.1 billion, consolidated debt increased by $1.1 billion and consolidated equity increased by $791 million. Debt and Equity FinancingsDuring the three years ended December 31, 2016, Phillips 66 Partners closed on the following public securities offerings in which it raised net proceeds of approximately $3.6 billion:•In October 2016, Phillips 66 Partners received net proceeds of $1,111 million from the issuance of $500 million of 3.55% Senior Notes due 2026 and $625 million of 4.90% Senior Notes due 2046.•In August 2016, Phillips 66 Partners received net proceeds of $299 million from a public offering of 6 million common units, at a price of $50.22 per unit.•In June 2016, Phillips 66 Partners began issuing common units under a continuous offering program, which allows for the offering of up to $250 million of common units. Through December 31, 2016, net proceeds of $19 million had been received under this program.•In May 2016, Phillips 66 Partners received net proceeds of $656 million from a public offering of 12.65 million common units, at a price of $52.40 per unit.•In February 2015, Phillips 66 Partners received net proceeds of $1,092 million from the issuance of $300 million of 2.646% Senior Notes due 2020, $500 million of 3.605% Senior Notes due 2025, and $300 million of 4.680% Senior Notes due 2045.46Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements•In February 2015, Phillips 66 Partners received net proceeds of $384 million from a public offering of 5.25 million common units, at a price of $75.50 per unit.Phillips 66 Partners primarily used these net proceeds to fund the cash portion of acquisitions of assets from Phillips 66. See Note 27—Phillips 66 Partners LP, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information on Phillips 66 Partners and additional details on assets contributed to the partnership by us during 2016.Credit Facilities and Commercial PaperIn October 2016, we amended our Phillips 66 revolving credit facility, primarily to extend the term from December 2019 to October 2021. Borrowing capacity under the Phillips 66 facility remained at $5 billion. The facility may be used for direct bank borrowings, as support for issuances of letters of credit, or as support for our commercial paper program. The facility is with a broad syndicate of financial institutions and contains covenants that we consider usual and customary for an agreement of this type for comparable commercial borrowers, including a maximum consolidated net debt-to-capitalization ratio of 60 percent. The agreement has customary events of default, such as nonpayment of principal when due; nonpayment of interest, fees or other amounts; violation of covenants; cross-payment default and cross-acceleration (in each case, to indebtedness in excess of a threshold amount); and a change of control. Borrowings under the facility will incur interest at the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a margin based on the credit rating of our senior unsecured long-term debt as determined from time to time by Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services (S&P) and Moody’s Investors Service (Moody’s). The facility also provides for customary fees, including administrative agent fees and commitment fees. As of December 31, 2016, no amount had been directly drawn under our $5 billion credit facility; however, $51 million in letters of credit had been issued that were supported by this facility. We have a $5 billion commercial paper program for short-term working capital needs that is supported by our revolving credit facility. Commercial paper maturities are generally limited to 90 days. As of December 31, 2016, we had no borrowings under our commercial paper program.Phillips 66 Partners also amended its revolving credit facility in October 2016, primarily to increase its borrowing capacity to $750 million and to extend the term from November 2019 to October 2021. The Phillips 66 Partners facility is with a broad syndicate of financial institutions. As of December 31, 2016, $210 million was outstanding under the partnership’s facility.Debt FinancingOur $7.5 billion of outstanding Senior Notes issued by Phillips 66 are guaranteed by Phillips 66 Company, a 100-percent-owned subsidiary. Our senior unsecured long-term debt has been rated investment grade by S&P (BBB+) and Moody’s (A3). We do not have any ratings triggers on any of our corporate debt that would cause an automatic default, and thereby impact our access to liquidity, in the event of a downgrade of our credit rating. If our credit rating deteriorated to a level prohibiting us from accessing the commercial paper market, we would expect to be able to access funds under our liquidity facilities mentioned above.Shelf RegistrationWe have a universal shelf registration statement on file with the SEC under which we, as a well-known seasoned issuer, have the ability to issue and sell an indeterminate amount of various types of debt and equity securities.Other FinancingWe have capital lease obligations related to equipment and transportation assets, and the use of an oil terminal in the United Kingdom. These leases mature within the next seventeen years. The present value of our minimum capital lease payments for these obligations as of December 31, 2016, was $188 million.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsAs part of our normal ongoing business operations, we enter into agreements with other parties to pursue business opportunities, with costs and risks apportioned among the parties as provided by the agreements. In April 2012, in connection with the Separation, we entered into an agreement to guarantee 100 percent of certain outstanding debt obligations of MSLP. At December 31, 2016, the aggregate principal amount of MSLP debt guaranteed by us was $123 million.47Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsIn June 2016, the operating lease commenced on our new headquarters facility in Houston, Texas, after construction was deemed substantially complete. Under the lease agreement, we have a residual value guarantee with a maximum future exposure of $554 million. The operating lease has a term of five years and provides us the option, at the end of the lease term, to request to renew the lease, purchase the facility, or assist the lessor in marketing it for resale. We have residual value guarantees associated with railcar and airplane leases with maximum future potential payments of $363 million. For information on our need to perform under the railcar lease guarantee, see the Capital Requirements section to follow, as well as Note 14—Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Also see Note 14 for additional information on our guarantees.Capital RequirementsFor information about our capital expenditures and investments, see “Capital Spending” below.Our debt balance at December 31, 2016, was $10.1 billion and our debt-to-capital ratio was 30 percent. Our target debt-to-capital ratio is between 20 and 30 percent. On February 8, 2017, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.63 per common share, payable March 1, 2017, to holders of record at the close of business on February 21, 2017. Our Board of Directors at various times has authorized repurchases of our outstanding common stock which aggregate to a total authorization of up to $9 billion. The share repurchases are expected to be funded primarily through available cash. The shares will be repurchased from time to time in the open market at our discretion, subject to market conditions and other factors, and in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements. We are not obligated to acquire any particular amount of common stock and may commence, suspend or discontinue purchases at any time or from time to time without prior notice. Since the inception of our share repurchases in 2012 through December 31, 2016, we have repurchased a total of 105,404,649 shares at a cost of $7.4 billion. Shares of stock repurchased are held as treasury shares.We own a 25 percent interest in the Dakota Access, LLC (DAPL) and Energy Transfer Crude Oil Company, LLC (ETCOP) joint ventures, which have been constructing pipelines to deliver crude oil produced in the Bakken area of North Dakota to market centers in the Midwest and the Gulf Coast. In May 2016, we and our co-venturer executed agreements under which we and our co-venturer would loan DAPL and ETCOP up to a maximum of $2,256 million and $227 million, respectively, with the amounts loaned by us and our co-venturer being proportionate to our ownership interests (Sponsor Loans). In August 2016, DAPL and ETCOP secured a $2.5 billion facility (Facility) with a syndicate of financial institutions on a limited recourse basis with certain guaranties, and the outstanding Sponsor Loans were repaid. Allowable draws under the Facility were initially reduced and finally suspended in September 2016 pending resolution of permitting delays. As a result, DAPL and ETCOP resumed making draws under the Sponsor Loans. The maximum amounts that could be loaned under the Sponsor Loans were reduced on September 22, 2016, to $1,411 million for DAPL and $76 million for ETCOP. As of December 31, 2016, DAPL and ETCOP had $976 million and $22 million, respectively, outstanding under the Sponsor Loans. Our 25 percent share of those loans was $244 million and $6 million, respectively. DAPL was granted the lone outstanding easement to complete work beneath the Missouri River on February 8, 2017. As a result, construction of its pipeline resumed and draws under the Facility were reinitiated to repay the outstanding Sponsor Loans and to continue funding of construction. The DAPL pipeline is expected to be completed and operational by mid-2017. The book values of our investments in DAPL and ETCOP at December 31, 2016, were $403 million and $129 million, respectively. In the first quarter of 2016, we and our co-venturer in WRB each made a $75 million partner loan to provide for WRB’s operating needs. On May 1, 2015, the U.S. Department of Transportation issued a final rule focused on the safe transportation of flammable liquids by rail. The final rule, which is being challenged, subjects new and existing railcars transporting crude oil in high volumes to heightened design standards, including thicker tank walls and heat shields, improved pressure relief valves and enhanced braking systems. We are currently evaluating the impact of the new regulations on our crude oil railcar fleet, which is mostly held under operating leases. The regulations become effective subsequent to the expiration dates of our leases. Although we have no direct contractual obligation to retrofit these leased railcars, certain leases are subject to residual value guarantees. Under the lease terms, we have the option either to purchase the railcars 48Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statementsor to return them to the lessors. If railcars are returned to the lessors, we may be required to make the lessors whole under the residual value guarantees, which are subject to a cap. The current market demand for crude oil railcars is low, which has resulted in a decline in crude oil railcar prices. At year-end 2016, based on an outside appraisal of the railcars’ fair value at the end of their lease terms, we estimated a total residual value deficiency of $94 million that would be payable at the end of the lease terms, with approximately one-half due in late 2017 and the other half due in 2019. Due to current market uncertainties, changes in the estimated fair values of railcars could occur, which could increase or decrease our currently estimated residual value deficiency. As of December 31, 2016, our maximum future exposure under the residual value guarantees was approximately $320 million. See Note 14—Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for information on charges recorded in 2016 associated with the residual value deficiencies and related cease-use costs for railcars permanently taken out of service.49Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsContractual ObligationsThe following table summarizes our aggregate contractual fixed and variable obligations as of December 31, 2016: Millions of Dollars Payments Due by Period Total Up to1 Year Years2-3 Years4-5 After5 Years Debt obligations (a)$10,054 531 548 1,049 7,926Capital lease obligations188 19 26 18 125Total debt10,242 550 574 1,067 8,051Interest on debt7,360 413 780 762 5,405Operating lease obligations1,556 404 638 285 229Purchase obligations (b)162,423 115,657 11,718 9,253 25,795Other long-term liabilities (c) Asset retirement obligations244 8 13 13 210Accrued environmental costs496 77 131 62 226Unrecognized tax benefits (d)7 7 (d) (d) (d)Total$182,328 117,116 13,854 11,442 39,916 (a)For additional information, see Note 13—Debt, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.(b)Represents any agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable, legally binding and specifies all significant terms. We expect these purchase obligations will be fulfilled by operating cash flows in the applicable maturity period. The majority of the purchase obligations are market-based contracts, including exchanges and futures, for the purchase of products such as crude oil and unfractionated NGL. The products are mostly used to supply our refineries and fractionators, optimize the supply chain, and resell to customers. Product purchase commitments with third parties totaled $123,715 million. In addition, $18,438 million are product purchases from CPChem, mostly for natural gas and NGL over the remaining contractual term of 83 years, and $4,732 million from Excel Paralubes, for base oil over the remaining contractual term of 8 years.Purchase obligations of $5,435 million are related to agreements to access and utilize the capacity of third-party equipment and facilities, including pipelines and product terminals, to transport, process, treat, and store products. The remainder is primarily our net share of purchase commitments for materials and services for jointly owned facilities where we are the operator.(c)Excludes pensions. For the 2017 through 2021 time period, we expect to contribute an average of $110 million per year to our qualified and nonqualified pension and other postretirement benefit plans in the United States and an average of $33 million per year to our non-U.S. plans, which are expected to be in excess of required minimums in many cases. The U.S. five-year average consists of $130 million for 2017 and then approximately $105 million per year for the remaining four years. Our minimum funding in 2017 is expected to be $55 million in the United States and $35 million outside the United States.(d)Excludes unrecognized tax benefits of $35 million because the ultimate disposition and timing of any payments to be made with regard to such amounts are not reasonably estimable or the amounts relate to potential refunds. Also excludes interest and penalties of $12 million. Although unrecognized tax benefits are not a contractual obligation, they are presented in this table because they represent potential demands on our liquidity.50Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsCapital Spending Millions of Dollars 2017Budget 2016 2015 2014Capital Expenditures and Investments Midstream$1,549 1,453 4,457 2,173Chemicals— — — —Refining905 1,149 1,069 1,038Marketing and Specialties132 98 122 439Corporate and Other112 144 116 123Total consolidated from continuing operations$2,698 2,844 5,764 3,773 Selected Equity Affiliates* DCP Midstream$243 99 438 776CPChem675 987 1,319 886WRB135 164 175 140 $1,053 1,250 1,932 1,802 *Our share of capital spending.MidstreamCapital spending in our Midstream segment during the three-year period ended December 31, 2016, included:•Construction activities related to the Sweeny Fractionator and Freeport LPG Export Terminal projects. •Pipeline projects being developed by two of our joint ventures, DAPL and ETCOP. We own a 25 percent interest in each of these joint ventures.•Acquisition of and projects to increase storage capacity at our crude oil and petroleum products terminal located near Beaumont, Texas.•Acquisition by Phillips 66 Partners of certain southeast Louisiana NGL logistics assets comprising approximately 500 miles of pipelines and a storage cavern connecting multiple fractionation facilities, refineries and a petrochemical facility.•Construction of rail racks to accept advantaged crude deliveries at our Bayway and Ferndale refineries. •Formation of the STACK JV. •Spending associated with return, reliability and maintenance projects in our Transportation and NGL businesses.During the three-year period ended December 31, 2016, DCP Midstream’s capital expenditures and investments were $2.6 billion on a 100 percent basis. In 2015, we contributed $1.5 billion of cash to DCP Midstream, LLC and our co-venturer contributed its interests in certain operating assets of equal value, that are held as equity investments. Upon completion of this transaction, our interest in DCP Midstream, LLC remained at 50 percent.In 2015, Rockies Express Pipeline LLC (REX) repaid $450 million of its debt, reducing its long-term debt to approximately $2.6 billion. REX funded the repayment through member cash contributions. Our 25 percent share was approximately $112 million, which we contributed to REX in 2015.51Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsChemicalsDuring the three-year period ended December 31, 2016, CPChem had a self-funded capital program, and thus required no new capital infusions from us or our co-venturer. During this period, on a 100 percent basis, CPChem’s capital expenditures and investments were $6.4 billion. In addition, CPChem’s advances to equity affiliates, primarily used for project construction and start-up activities, were $206 million and its repayments received from equity affiliates were $81 million.RefiningCapital spending for the Refining segment during the three-year period ended December 31, 2016, was $3.3 billion, primarily for air emission reduction and clean fuels projects to meet new environmental standards, refinery upgrade projects to increase accessibility of advantaged crudes and improve product yields, improvements to the operating integrity of key processing units, and safety-related projects.Key projects completed during the three-year period included: •Installation of facilities to reduce nitrous oxide emissions from the fluid catalytic cracker at the Alliance Refinery.•Installation of a tail gas treating unit at the Humber Refinery to reduce emissions from the sulfur recovery units.•Installation of facilities to improve clean product yields at the Sweeny and Lake Charles refineries.•Installation of facilities to improve processing of advantaged crudes at the Alliance and Ponca City refineries. •Installation of facilities to comply with U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Tier 3 gasoline regulations at the Alliance and Lake Charles refineries.•Installation of a crude tank to increase accessibility of waterborne crude at the Los Angeles Refinery.Major construction activities in progress include: •Installation of facilities to comply with EPA Tier 3 gasoline regulations at the Sweeny and Bayway refineries.•Installation of facilities to improve processing of advantaged crudes at the Billings Refinery. •Installation of facilities to improve clean product yield at the Bayway and Ponca City refineries.Generally, our equity affiliates in the Refining segment are intended to have self-funding capital programs. During this three-year period, on a 100 percent basis, WRB’s capital expenditures and investments were $958 million. We expect WRB’s 2017 capital program to be self-funding.Marketing and SpecialtiesCapital spending for the M&S segment during the three-year period ended December 31, 2016, was primarily for the acquisition of, and investments in, a limited number of retail sites in the Western and Midwestern portions of the United States, which have subsequently been disposed of; the acquisition of Spectrum Corporation, a private label specialty lubricants business headquartered in Memphis, Tennessee; the acquisition of the remaining interest that we did not already own in an entity that operates a power and steam generation plant; reliability and maintenance projects; and projects targeted at developing our new international sites.Corporate and OtherCapital spending for Corporate and Other during the three-year period ended December 31, 2016, was primarily for projects related to information technology and facilities.2017 BudgetOur 2017 capital budget is $2.7 billion including Phillips 66 Partners’ capital budget of $0.4 billion. This excludes our portion of planned capital spending by joint ventures DCP Midstream, CPChem and WRB totaling $1.1 billion, all of which is expected to be self-funded.52Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsThe Midstream capital budget of $1.5 billion is focused on development around its existing infrastructure’s footprint, including continued expansion of the Beaumont Terminal and investment in pipelines and other terminals. Refining’s capital budget of $0.9 billion is directed toward reliability, safety and environmental projects, as well as projects designed to improve clean product yields and lower feedstock costs. In M&S, we plan to invest approximately $0.1 billion to expand and enhance our fuel marketing business. In Corporate and Other, we plan to fund approximately $0.1 billion in projects primarily related to information technology and facilities.ContingenciesA number of lawsuits involving a variety of claims that arose in the ordinary course of business have been filed against us or are subject to indemnifications provided by us. We also may be required to remove or mitigate the effects on the environment of the placement, storage, disposal or release of certain chemical, mineral and petroleum substances at various active and inactive sites. We regularly assess the need for financial recognition or disclosure of these contingencies. In the case of all known contingencies (other than those related to income taxes), we accrue a liability when the loss is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable. If a range of amounts can be reasonably estimated and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount, then the minimum of the range is accrued. We do not reduce these liabilities for potential insurance or third-party recoveries. If applicable, we accrue receivables for probable insurance or other third-party recoveries. In the case of income-tax-related contingencies, we use a cumulative probability-weighted loss accrual in cases where sustaining a tax position is less than certain.Based on currently available information, we believe it is remote that future costs related to known contingent liability exposures will exceed current accruals by an amount that would have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements. As we learn new facts concerning contingencies, we reassess our position both with respect to accrued liabilities and other potential exposures. Estimates particularly sensitive to future changes include contingent liabilities recorded for environmental remediation, tax and legal matters. Estimated future environmental remediation costs are subject to change due to such factors as the uncertain magnitude of cleanup costs, the unknown time and extent of such remedial actions that may be required, and the determination of our liability in proportion to that of other potentially responsible parties. Estimated future costs related to tax and legal matters are subject to change as events evolve and as additional information becomes available during the administrative and litigation processes.Legal and Tax MattersOur legal and tax matters are handled by our legal and tax organizations. These organizations apply their knowledge, experience and professional judgment to the specific characteristics of our cases and uncertain tax positions. We employ a litigation management process to manage and monitor the legal proceedings against us. Our process facilitates the early evaluation and quantification of potential exposures in individual cases and enables the tracking of those cases that have been scheduled for trial and/or mediation. Based on professional judgment and experience in using these litigation management tools and available information about current developments in all our cases, our legal organization regularly assesses the adequacy of current accruals and determines if adjustment of existing accruals, or establishment of new accruals, is required. In the case of income-tax-related contingencies, we monitor tax legislation and court decisions, the status of tax audits and the statute of limitations within which a taxing authority can assert a liability. See Note 21—Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information about income-tax-related contingencies.EnvironmentalLike other companies in our industry, we are subject to numerous international, federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. Among the most significant of these international and federal environmental laws and regulations are the: •U.S. Federal Clean Air Act, which governs air emissions.•U.S. Federal Clean Water Act, which governs discharges into water bodies.•European Union Regulation for Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH), which governs the manufacture, placing on the market or use of chemicals.•U.S. Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), which imposes liability on generators, transporters and arrangers of hazardous substances at sites where hazardous substance releases have occurred or are threatening to occur.53Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements•U.S. Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), which governs the treatment, storage and disposal of solid waste.•U.S. Federal Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA), which requires facilities to report toxic chemical inventories to local emergency planning committees and response departments.•U.S. Federal Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA90), under which owners and operators of onshore facilities and pipelines as well as owners and operators of vessels are liable for removal costs and damages that result from a discharge of oil into navigable waters of the United States.•European Union Trading Directive resulting in the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS), which uses a market-based mechanism to incentivize the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.These laws and their implementing regulations set limits on emissions and, in the case of discharges to water, establish water quality limits. They also, in most cases, require permits in association with new or modified operations. These permits can require an applicant to collect substantial information in connection with the application process, which can be expensive and time consuming. In addition, there can be delays associated with notice and comment periods and the agency’s processing of the application. Many of the delays associated with the permitting process are beyond the control of the applicant.Many states and foreign countries where we operate also have, or are developing, similar environmental laws and regulations governing these same types of activities. For example, in California the South Coast Air Quality Management District approved amendments to the Regional Clean Air Incentives Market (RECLAIM) that became effective in 2016, which require a phased reduction of nitrogen oxide emissions through 2022 and potentially affect refineries in the Los Angeles metropolitan area. While similar, in some cases these regulations may impose additional, or more stringent, requirements that can add to the cost and difficulty of developing infrastructure and marketing or transporting products across state and international borders.The ultimate financial impact arising from environmental laws and regulations is neither clearly known nor easily determinable as new standards, such as air emission standards, water quality standards and stricter fuel regulations, continue to evolve. However, environmental laws and regulations, including those that may arise to address concerns about global climate change, are expected to continue to have an increasing impact on our operations in the United States and in other countries in which we operate. Notable areas of potential impacts include air emission compliance and remediation obligations in the United States.An example of this in the fuels area is the Energy Policy Act of 2005, which imposed obligations to provide increasing volumes of renewable fuels in transportation motor fuels through 2012. These obligations were changed with the enactment of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA). EISA requires fuel producers and importers to provide additional renewable fuels for transportation motor fuels and stipulates a mix of various types to be included through 2022. We have met the increasingly stringent requirements to date while establishing implementation, operating and capital strategies, along with advanced technology development, to address projected future requirements. It is uncertain how various future requirements contained in EISA, and the regulations promulgated thereunder, may be implemented and what their full impact may be on our operations. For the 2017 compliance year, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has set volumes of advanced and total renewable fuel at higher levels than mandated in previous years; it is uncertain if these increased obligations will be achievable by fuel producers and shippers without drawing on the Renewable Identification Number (RIN) bank. For compliance years after 2017, we do not know whether the EPA will utilize its authority to reduce statutory volumes. Additionally, we may experience a decrease in demand for refined petroleum products due to the regulatory program as currently promulgated. This program continues to be the subject of possible Congressional review and re-promulgation in revised form, and the EPA’s regulations pertaining to the 2014, 2015, and 2016 compliance years are subject to legal challenge, further creating uncertainty regarding renewable fuel volume requirements and obligations. The EPA’s Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) program was also implemented in accordance with the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and EISA. The RFS program sets annual quotas for the percentage of biofuels (such as ethanol) that must be blended into motor fuels consumed in the United States. A RIN represents a serial number assigned to each gallon of biofuel produced or imported into the United States. As a producer of petroleum-based motor fuels, we are obligated to blend biofuels into the products we produce at a rate that is at least equal to the EPA’s quota and, to the extent we do not, we must purchase RINs in the open market to satisfy our obligation under the RFS program. The market for RINs has been the subject of fraudulent third-party activity, and it is reasonably possible that some RINs that we have purchased may be determined to be invalid. Should that occur, we could incur costs to replace those fraudulent RINs. Although the 54Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statementscost for replacing any fraudulently marketed RINs is not reasonably estimable at this time, we would not expect to incur the full financial impact of fraudulent RINs replacement costs in any single interim or annual period, and would not expect such costs to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition.We also are subject to certain laws and regulations relating to environmental remediation obligations associated with current and past operations. Such laws and regulations include CERCLA and RCRA and their state equivalents. Remediation obligations include cleanup responsibility arising from petroleum releases from underground storage tanks located at numerous previously and currently owned and/or operated petroleum-marketing outlets throughout the United States. Federal and state laws require contamination caused by such underground storage tank releases be assessed and remediated to meet applicable standards. In addition to other cleanup standards, many states have adopted cleanup criteria for methyl tertiary-butyl ether (MTBE) for both soil and groundwater.At RCRA-permitted facilities, we are required to assess environmental conditions. If conditions warrant, we may be required to remediate contamination caused by prior operations. In contrast to CERCLA, which is often referred to as “Superfund,” the cost of corrective action activities under RCRA corrective action programs typically is borne solely by us. We anticipate increased expenditures for RCRA remediation activities may be required, but such annual expenditures for the near term are not expected to vary significantly from the range of such expenditures we have experienced over the past few years. Longer-term expenditures are subject to considerable uncertainty and may fluctuate significantly.We occasionally receive requests for information or notices of potential liability from the EPA and state environmental agencies alleging that we are a potentially responsible party under CERCLA or an equivalent state statute. On occasion, we also have been made a party to cost recovery litigation by those agencies or by private parties. These requests, notices and lawsuits assert potential liability for remediation costs at various sites that typically are not owned by us, but allegedly contain wastes attributable to our past operations. As of December 31, 2015, we reported that we had been notified of potential liability under CERCLA and comparable state laws at 36 sites within the United States. During 2016, there was one new site for which we received notification of potential liability, three sites were resolved but not closed, and three sites were deemed resolved and closed, leaving 31 unresolved sites with potential liability at December 31, 2016. For most Superfund sites, our potential liability will be significantly less than the total site remediation costs because the percentage of waste attributable to us, versus that attributable to all other potentially responsible parties, is relatively low. Although liability of those potentially responsible is generally joint and several for federal sites and frequently so for state sites, other potentially responsible parties at sites where we are a party typically have had the financial strength to meet their obligations, and where they have not, or where potentially responsible parties could not be located, our share of liability has not increased materially. Many of the sites for which we are potentially responsible are still under investigation by the EPA or the state agencies concerned. Prior to actual cleanup, those potentially responsible normally assess site conditions, apportion responsibility and determine the appropriate remediation. In some instances, we may have no liability or attain a settlement of liability. Actual cleanup costs generally occur after the parties obtain EPA or equivalent state agency approval of a remediation plan. There are relatively few sites where we are a major participant, and given the timing and amounts of anticipated expenditures, neither the cost of remediation at those sites nor such costs at all CERCLA sites, in the aggregate, is expected to have a material adverse effect on our competitive or financial condition.Expensed environmental costs were $648 million in 2016 and are expected to be a similar amount in 2017 and in 2018. Capitalized environmental costs were $224 million in 2016 and are expected to be approximately $170 million and $220 million, in 2017 and 2018, respectively. This amount does not include capital expenditures made for another purpose that have an indirect benefit on environmental compliance.Accrued liabilities for remediation activities are not reduced for potential recoveries from insurers or other third parties and are not discounted (except those assumed in a purchase business combination, which we record on a discounted basis).Many of these liabilities result from CERCLA, RCRA and similar state laws that require us to undertake certain investigative and remedial activities at sites where we conduct, or once conducted, operations or at sites where our generated waste was disposed. We also have accrued for a number of sites we identified that may require environmental remediation, but which are not currently the subject of CERCLA, RCRA or state enforcement activities. If applicable, we accrue receivables for probable insurance or other third-party recoveries. In the future, we may incur significant costs under both CERCLA and RCRA. Remediation activities vary substantially in duration and cost from site to site, 55Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statementsdepending on the mix of unique site characteristics, evolving remediation technologies, diverse regulatory agencies and enforcement policies, and the presence or absence of potentially liable third parties. Therefore, it is difficult to develop reasonable estimates of future site remediation costs.Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, and as with other companies engaged in similar businesses, environmental costs and liabilities are inherent concerns in our operations and products, and there can be no assurance that material costs and liabilities will not be incurred. However, we currently do not expect any material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position as a result of compliance with current environmental laws and regulations.Climate ChangeThere has been a broad range of proposed or promulgated state, national and international laws focusing on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction, including various regulations proposed or issued by the EPA. These proposed or promulgated laws apply or could apply in states and/or countries where we have interests or may have interests in the future. Laws regulating GHG emissions continue to evolve, and while it is not possible to accurately estimate either a timetable for implementation or our future compliance costs relating to implementation, such laws potentially could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition as a result of increasing costs of compliance, lengthening project implementation and agency review items, or reducing demand for certain hydrocarbon products. Examples of legislation or precursors for possible regulation that do or could affect our operations include: •EU ETS, which is part of the European Union’s policy to combat climate change and is a key tool for reducing industrial greenhouse gas emissions. EU ETS impacts factories, power stations and other installations across all EU member states. •California’s Global Warming Solutions Act, which requires the California Air Resources Board to develop regulations and market mechanisms that will target reduction of California’s GHG emissions by 25 percent by 2020 (as well as the recently enacted SB32, which requires further reduction of California's GHG emissions to 40 percent below the 1990 emission level by 2030). Other GHG emissions programs in the western U.S. states have been enacted or are under consideration or development, including amendments to California's Low Carbon Fuel Standard, Oregon's Low Carbon Fuel Standard, and Washington's carbon reduction programs.•The U.S. Supreme Court decision in Massachusetts v. EPA, 549 U.S. 497, 127 S. Ct. 1438 (2007), confirming that the EPA has the authority to regulate carbon dioxide as an “air pollutant” under the Federal Clean Air Act.•The EPA’s announcement on March 29, 2010 (published as “Interpretation of Regulations that Determine Pollutants Covered by Clean Air Act Permitting Programs,” 75 Fed. Reg. 17004 (April 2, 2010)), and the EPA’s and U.S. Department of Transportation’s joint promulgation of a Final Rule on April 1, 2010, that triggers regulation of GHGs under the Clean Air Act. These collectively may lead to more climate-based claims for damages, and may result in longer agency review time for development projects to determine the extent of potential climate change. •EPA's 2015 Final Rule regulating GHG emissions from existing fossil fuel-fired electrical generating units under the Federal Clean Air Act, commonly referred to as the Clean Power Plan.•Carbon taxes in certain jurisdictions.•GHG emission cap and trade programs in certain jurisdictions.In the EU, the first phase of the EU ETS completed at the end of 2007 and Phase II was undertaken from 2008 through to 2012. The current phase (Phase III) runs from 2013 through to 2020, with the main changes being reduced allocation of free allowances and increased auctioning of new allowances. Phillips 66 has assets that are subject to the EU ETS, and the company is actively engaged in minimizing any financial impact from the EU ETS.From November 30 to December 12, 2015, more than 190 countries, including the United States, participated in the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris, France. The conference culminated in what is known as the “Paris Agreement,” which, upon certain conditions being met, entered into force on November 4, 2016. The Paris Agreement establishes a commitment by signatory parties to pursue domestic GHG emission reductions. In the United States, some additional form of regulation is likely to be forthcoming in the future at the federal or state levels with respect to GHG emissions. Such regulation could take any of several forms that may result in the creation of additional costs in the form of taxes, the restriction of output, investments of capital to maintain compliance with laws 56Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statementsand regulations, or required acquisition or trading of emission allowances. We are working to continuously improve operational and energy efficiency through resource and energy conservation throughout our operations.Compliance with changes in laws and regulations that create a GHG emission trading program, GHG reduction requirements or carbon taxes could significantly increase our costs, reduce demand for fossil energy derived products, impact the cost and availability of capital and increase our exposure to litigation. Such laws and regulations could also increase demand for less carbon intensive energy sources. An example of one such program is California’s cap and trade program, which was promulgated pursuant to the State’s Global Warming Solutions Act. The program had been limited to certain stationary sources, which include our refineries in California, but beginning in January 2015 expanded to include emissions from transportation fuels distributed in California. Inclusion of transportation fuels in California’s cap and trade program as currently promulgated has increased our cap and trade program compliance costs. The ultimate impact on our financial performance, either positive or negative, from this and similar programs, will depend on a number of factors, including, but not limited to: •Whether and to what extent legislation or regulation is enacted.•The nature of the legislation or regulation (such as a cap and trade system or a tax on emissions).•The GHG reductions required.•The price and availability of offsets.•The amount and allocation of allowances.•Technological and scientific developments leading to new products or services.•Any potential significant physical effects of climate change (such as increased severe weather events, changes in sea levels and changes in temperature).•Whether, and the extent to which, increased compliance costs are ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services.We consider and take into account anticipated future GHG emissions in designing and developing major facilities and projects, and implement energy efficiency initiatives to reduce such emissions. GHG emissions, legal requirements regulating such emissions, and the possible physical effects of climate change on our coastal assets are incorporated into our planning, investment, and risk management decision-making.57Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATESThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to select appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. See Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for descriptions of our major accounting policies. Certain of these accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent that there is a reasonable likelihood that materially different amounts would have been reported under different conditions, or if different assumptions had been used. The following discussion of critical accounting estimates, along with the discussion of contingencies in this report, address all important accounting areas where the nature of accounting estimates or assumptions could be material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change.ImpairmentsLong-lived assets used in operations are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate a possible significant deterioration in future cash flows is expected. If the sum of the undiscounted pre-tax cash flows of an asset group is less than the carrying value, including applicable liabilities, the carrying value is written down to estimated fair value. Individual assets are grouped for impairment purposes based on a judgmental assessment of the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets (for example, at a refinery complex level). Because there usually is a lack of quoted market prices for long-lived assets, the fair value of impaired assets is typically determined using one or more of the following methods: the present value of expected future cash flows using discount rates and other assumptions believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants; a market multiple of earnings for similar assets; or historical market transactions of similar assets, adjusted using principal market participant assumptions when necessary. The expected future cash flows used for impairment reviews and related fair value calculations are based on judgmental assessments of future volumes, commodity prices, operating costs, margins, discount rates and capital project decisions, considering all available information at the date of review.Investments in nonconsolidated entities accounted for under the equity method are assessed for impairment when there are indicators of a loss in value, such as a lack of sustained earnings capacity or a current fair value less than the investment’s carrying amount. When it is determined that an indicated impairment is other than temporary, a charge is recognized for the difference between the investment’s carrying value and its estimated fair value. When determining whether a decline in value is other than temporary, management considers factors such as the length of time and extent of the decline, the investee’s financial condition and near-term prospects, and our ability and intention to retain our investment for a period that allows for recovery. When quoted market prices are not available, the fair value is usually based on the present value of expected future cash flows using discount rates and other assumptions believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants and a market analysis of comparable assets, if appropriate. Differing assumptions could affect the timing and the amount of an impairment of an investment in any period.Asset Retirement ObligationsUnder various contracts, permits and regulations, we have legal obligations to remove tangible equipment and restore the land at the end of operations at certain operational sites. Our largest asset removal obligations involve asbestos abatement at refineries. Estimating the timing and amount of payments for future asset removal costs is difficult. Most of these removal obligations are many years, or decades, in the future, and the contracts and regulations often have vague descriptions of what removal practices and criteria must be met when the removal event actually occurs. Asset removal technologies and costs, regulatory and other compliance considerations, expenditure timing, and other inputs into valuation of the obligation, including discount and inflation rates, are also subject to change.Environmental CostsIn addition to asset retirement obligations discussed above, we have certain obligations to complete environmental-related projects. These projects are primarily related to cleanup at domestic refineries, underground storage sites and non-operated sites. Future environmental remediation costs are difficult to estimate because they are subject to change due to such factors as the uncertain magnitude of cleanup costs, timing and extent of such remedial actions that may be required, and the determination of our liability in proportion to that of other responsible parties.58Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsIntangible Assets and GoodwillAt December 31, 2016, we had $764 million of intangible assets that we have determined to have indefinite useful lives, and are not amortized. This judgmental assessment of an indefinite useful life must be continuously evaluated in the future. If, due to changes in facts and circumstances, management determines these intangible assets have finite useful lives, amortization will commence at that time on a prospective basis. As long as these intangible assets are judged to have indefinite lives, they will be subject to annual impairment tests that require management’s judgment of the estimated fair value of these intangible assets.At December 31, 2016, we had $3.3 billion of goodwill recorded in conjunction with past business combinations. Goodwill is not amortized. Instead, goodwill is subject to at least annual reviews for impairment at a reporting unit level. The reporting unit or units used to evaluate and measure goodwill for impairment are determined primarily from the manner in which the business is managed. A reporting unit is an operating segment or a component that is one level below an operating segment.Because quoted market prices for our reporting units are not available, management applies judgment in determining the estimated fair values of the reporting units for purposes of performing the goodwill impairment test. Management uses all available information to make this fair value determination, including observed market earnings multiples of comparable companies, our common stock price and associated total company market capitalization. Sales or dispositions of significant assets within a reporting unit are allocated a portion of that reporting unit’s goodwill, based on relative fair values, which impacts the amount of gain or loss on the sale or disposition.We completed our annual impairment test, as of October 1, 2016, and concluded that the fair value of each of our reporting units exceeded their respective recorded net book values (including goodwill), by over 25 percent for our Refining reporting unit and by over 100 percent for our Transportation and M&S reporting units. A decline in the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting units in the future could result in an impairment. For example, a prolonged or significant decline in our stock price or a significant decline in actual or forecasted earnings could provide evidence of a significant decline in fair value and a need to record a material impairment of goodwill for one or more of our reporting units. After we have completed our annual test, we continue to monitor for impairment indicators, which can lead to further goodwill impairment testing.Tax Assets and LiabilitiesOur operations are subject to various taxes, including federal, state and foreign income taxes, property taxes, and transactional taxes such as excise, sales/use and payroll taxes. We record tax liabilities based on our assessment of existing tax laws and regulations. The recording of tax liabilities requires significant judgment and estimates. We recognize the financial statement effects of an income tax position when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination by a taxing authority. A contingent liability related to a transactional tax claim is recorded if the loss is both probable and estimable. Actual incurred tax liabilities can vary from our estimates for a variety of reasons, including different interpretations of tax laws and regulations and different assessments of the amount of tax due.In determining our income tax provision, we assess the likelihood our deferred tax assets will be recovered through future taxable income. Valuation allowances reduce deferred tax assets to an amount that will, more likely than not, be realized. Judgment is required in estimating the amount of valuation allowance, if any, that should be recorded against our deferred tax assets. Based on our historical taxable income, our expectations for the future, and available tax-planning strategies, we expect the net deferred tax assets will more likely than not be realized as offsets to reversing deferred tax liabilities and as reductions to future taxable income. If our actual results of operations differ from such estimates or our estimates of future taxable income change, the valuation allowance may need to be revised.New tax laws and regulations, as well as changes to existing tax laws and regulations, are continuously being proposed or promulgated. The implementation of future legislative and regulatory tax initiatives could result in increased tax liabilities that cannot be predicted at this time.Projected Benefit Obligations Determination of the projected benefit obligations for our defined benefit pension and postretirement plans impacts the obligations on the balance sheet and the amount of benefit expense in the income statement. The actuarial determination of projected benefit obligations and company contribution requirements involves judgment about uncertain future events, including estimated retirement dates, salary levels at retirement, mortality rates, lump-sum election rates, rates of return on plan assets, future interest rates, future health care cost-trend rates, and rates of utilization of health care services by 59Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statementsretirees. Due to the specialized nature of these calculations, we engage outside actuarial firms to assist in the determination of these projected benefit obligations and company contribution requirements. Due to differing objectives and requirements between financial accounting rules and the pension plan funding regulations promulgated by governmental agencies, the actuarial methods and assumptions for the two purposes differ in certain important respects. Ultimately, we will be required to fund all promised benefits under pension and postretirement benefit plans not funded by plan assets or investment returns, but the judgmental assumptions used in the actuarial calculations significantly affect periodic financial statements and funding patterns over time. Benefit expense is particularly sensitive to the discount rate and return on plan assets assumptions. A one percentage-point decrease in the discount rate assumption would increase annual benefit expense by an estimated $60 million, while a one percentage-point decrease in the return on plan assets assumption would increase annual benefit expense by an estimated $30 million. In determining the discount rate, we use yields on high-quality fixed income investments with payments matched to the estimated distributions of benefits from our plans.In 2016 and 2015, we used expected long-term rates of return of 6.75 percent and 7 percent, respectively, for the U.S. pension plan assets, which account for 74 percent of our overall pension plan assets. The actual U.S. pension plan asset returns were a gain of 7 percent in 2016 and a loss of less than 1 percent in 2015. For the past ten years, actual returns averaged 6 percent for the U.S. pension plan assets.NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDSIn January 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2017-04, “Intangibles—Goodwill and Other—Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment,” which eliminates Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. Under the revised test, an entity should perform its annual, or interim, goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. An entity should recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value; however, the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. Public business entities should apply the guidance in ASU No. 2017-04 for its annual or any interim goodwill impairment tests in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the provisions of ASU No. 2017-04.In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-01, “Business Combinations: Clarifying the Definition of a Business,” which clarifies the definition of a business with the objective of adding guidance to assist in evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions of assets or businesses. The amendment provides a screen for determining when a transaction involves the acquisition of a business. If substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or a group of similar identifiable assets, then the transaction does not involve the acquisition of a business. If the screen is not met, then the amendment requires that to be considered a business, the operation must include at a minimum an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create an output. The guidance may reduce the number of transactions accounted for as business acquisitions. Public business entities should apply the guidance in ASU No. 2017-01 to annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those periods, with early adoption permitted. The amendments should be applied prospectively, and no disclosures are required at the effective date. We are currently evaluating the provisions of ASU No. 2017-01.In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-18, “Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash,” which clarifies the classification and presentation of changes in restricted cash. The amendment requires that a statement of cash flows explain the change during the period in the total of cash, cash equivalents, and amounts generally described as restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents. Public business entities should apply the guidance in ASU No. 2016-18 on a retrospective basis for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those annual periods, with early adoption permitted. We do not expect the adoption of this ASU to have a material impact on our financial statements. In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, “Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments,” which clarifies the treatment of several cash flow categories. In addition, ASU No. 2016-15 clarifies that when cash receipts and cash payments have aspects of more than one class of cash flows and cannot be separated, classification will depend on the predominant source or use. Public business entities should apply 60Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statementsthe guidance in ASU No. 2016-15 on a retrospective basis for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those annual periods, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the provisions of ASU No. 2016-15 and assessing the impact on our financial statements. In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, “Financial Instruments—Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.” The new standard amends the impairment model to utilize an expected loss methodology in place of the currently used incurred loss methodology, which will result in the more timely recognition of losses. Public business entities should apply the guidance in ASU No. 2016-13 for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption will be permitted for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018. We are currently evaluating the provisions of ASU No. 2016-13 and assessing the impact on our financial statements.In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, “Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting,” which simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment award transactions including accounting for income taxes and classification of excess tax benefits on the statement of cash flows, forfeitures and minimum statutory tax withholding requirements. Public business entities should apply the guidance in ASU No. 2016-09 for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the provisions of ASU No. 2016-09 and assessing the impact on our financial statements.In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842).” In the new standard, the FASB modified its determination of whether a contract is a lease rather than whether a lease is a capital or operating lease under the previous accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). A contract represents a lease if a transfer of control occurs over an identified property, plant and equipment for a period of time in exchange for consideration. Control over the use of the identified asset includes the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from the use of the asset and the right to direct its use. The FASB continued to maintain two classifications of leases — financing and operating — which are substantially similar to capital and operating leases in the previous lease guidance. Under the new standard, recognition of assets and liabilities arising from operating leases will require recognition on the balance sheet. The effect of all leases in the statement of comprehensive income and the statement of cash flows will be largely unchanged. Lessor accounting will also be largely unchanged. Additional disclosures will be required for financing and operating leases for both lessors and lessees. Public business entities should apply the guidance in ASU No. 2016-02 for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the provisions of ASU No. 2016-02 and assessing its impact on our financial statements.In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01, “Financial Instruments-Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities,” to meet its objective of providing more decision-useful information about financial instruments. The majority of this ASU’s provisions amend only the presentation or disclosures of financial instruments; however, one provision will also affect net income. Equity investments carried under the cost method or lower of cost or fair value method of accounting, in accordance with current GAAP, will have to be carried at fair value upon adoption of ASU No. 2016-01, with changes in fair value recorded in net income. For equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values, a company may elect to carry such investments at cost less impairments, if any, adjusted up or down for price changes in similar financial instruments issued by the investee, when and if observed. Public business entities should apply the guidance in ASU No. 2016-01 for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those annual periods, with early adoption prohibited. We are currently evaluating the provisions of ASU No. 2016-01. Our initial review indicates that ASU No. 2016-01 will have a limited impact on our financial statements.In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606).” The new standard converged guidance on recognizing revenues in contracts with customers under GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards. This ASU is intended to improve comparability of revenue recognition practices across entities, industries, jurisdictions and capital markets and expand disclosure requirements. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date.” The amendment in this ASU defers the effective date of ASU No. 2014-09 for all entities for one year. Public business entities should apply the guidance in ASU No. 2014-09 to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. Earlier adoption is permitted only as of annual reporting 61Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statementsperiods beginning after December 31, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. Retrospective or modified retrospective application of the accounting standard is required. ASU No. 2014-09 was further amended in March 2016 by the provisions of ASU No. 2016-08, “Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net),” in April 2016 by the provisions of ASU No. 2016-10, “Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing,” in May 2016 by the provisions of ASU No. 2016-12, “Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients,” and in December 2016 by the provisions of ASU No. 2016-20, “Technical Corrections to Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers.” As part of our assessment work-to-date, we have formed an implementation work team, completed training on the new ASU’s revenue recognition model and are continuing our contract review and documentation. Our expectation is to adopt the standard on January 1, 2018, using the modified retrospective application. In addition, we expect to present revenue net of sales-based taxes collected from our customers resulting in no impact to earnings. Sales-based taxes include excise taxes on petroleum product sales as noted on our consolidated statement of income. Our evaluation of the new ASU is ongoing, which includes understanding the impact of adoption on earnings from equity method investments. Based upon our analysis to-date, we have not identified any other material impact on our financial statements other than disclosures.62Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsItem 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKFinancial Instrument Market RiskWe and certain of our subsidiaries hold and issue derivative contracts and financial instruments that expose our cash flows or earnings to changes in commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates. We may use financial- and commodity-based derivative contracts to manage the risks produced by changes in the prices of crude oil and related products, natural gas, NGL, and electric power; fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates; or to capture market opportunities.Our use of derivative instruments is governed by an “Authority Limitations” document approved by our Board of Directors that prohibits the use of highly leveraged derivatives or derivative instruments without sufficient market liquidity for comparable valuations. The Authority Limitations document also establishes Value at Risk (VaR) limits, and compliance with these limits is monitored daily. Our Chief Financial Officer monitors risks resulting from foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. Our President monitors commodity price risk. The Commercial organization manages our commercial marketing, optimizes our commodity flows and positions, and monitors related risks of our businesses.Commodity Price RiskWe sell into or receive supply from the worldwide crude oil, refined products, natural gas, NGL, and electric power markets, exposing our revenues, purchases, cost of operating activities, and cash flows to fluctuations in the prices for these commodities. Generally, our policy is to remain exposed to the market prices of commodities. Consistent with this policy, our Commercial organization uses derivative contracts to effectively convert our exposure from fixed-price sales contracts, often requested by refined product customers, back to fluctuating market prices. Conversely, our Commercial organization also uses futures, forwards, swaps and options in various markets to accomplish the following objectives to optimize the value of our supply chain, and this may reduce our exposure to fluctuations in market prices:•In addition to cash settlement prior to contract expiration, exchange-traded futures contracts may be settled by physical delivery of the commodity. This provides another source of supply to balance physical systems or to meet our refinery requirements and marketing demand.•Manage the risk to our cash flows from price exposures on specific crude oil, refined product, natural gas, NGL, and electric power transactions.•Enable us to use the market knowledge gained from these activities to capture market opportunities such as moving physical commodities to more profitable locations, storing commodities to capture seasonal or time premiums, and blending commodities to capture quality upgrades. Derivatives may be utilized to optimize these activities.We use a VaR model to estimate the loss in fair value that could potentially result on a single day from the effect of adverse changes in market conditions on the derivative financial instruments and derivative commodity instruments held or issued, including commodity purchase and sales contracts recorded on the balance sheet at December 31, 2016, as derivative instruments. Using Monte Carlo simulation, a 95 percent confidence level and a one-day holding period, the VaR for those instruments issued or held for trading purposes at December 31, 2016 and 2015, was immaterial to our cash flows and net income. The VaR for instruments held for purposes other than trading at December 31, 2016 and 2015, was also immaterial to our cash flows and net income.63Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsInterest Rate RiskOur use of fixed- or variable-rate debt directly exposes us to interest rate risk. Fixed-rate debt, such as our senior notes, exposes us to changes in the fair value of our debt due to changes in market interest rates. Fixed-rate debt also exposes us to the risk that we may need to refinance maturing debt with new debt at higher rates, or that we may be obligated to pay rates higher than the current market. Variable-rate debt, such as borrowings under our revolving credit facility, exposes us to short-term changes in market rates that impact our interest expense. The following tables provide information about our debt instruments that are sensitive to changes in U.S. interest rates. These tables present principal cash flows and related weighted-average interest rates by expected maturity dates. Weighted-average variable rates are based on effective rates at the reporting date. The carrying amount of our floating-rate debt approximates its fair value. The fair value of the fixed-rate financial instruments is estimated based on quoted market prices.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSManagement’s Discussion and Analysis is the company’s analysis of its financial performance, financial condition, and significant trends that may affect future performance. It should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

The words “anticipate,” “estimate,” “believe,” “budget,” “continue,” “could,” “intend,” “may,” “plan,” “potential,” “predict,” “seek,” “should,” “will,” “would,” “expect,” “objective,” “projection,” “forecast,” “goal,” “guidance,” “outlook,” “effort,” “target” and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements. The company does not undertake to update, revise or correct any of the forward-looking information unless required to do so under the federal securities laws. Readers are cautioned that such forward-looking statements should be read in conjunction with the company’s disclosures under the heading: “CAUTIONARY STATEMENT FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE ‘SAFE HARBOR’ PROVISIONS OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995.” The terms “earnings” and “loss” as used in Management’s Discussion and Analysis refer to net income (loss) attributable to Phillips 66.BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND EXECUTIVE OVERVIEWPhillips 66 is an energy manufacturing and logistics company with midstream, chemicals, refining, and marketing and specialties businesses. At December 31, 2017, we had total assets of $54.4 billion.Executive OverviewWe reported earnings of $5.1 billion and generated $3.6 billion in cash from operating activities in 2017. Our reported earnings included a $2.7 billion provisional income tax benefit from the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act) enacted on December 22, 2017. Phillips 66 Partners LP (Phillips 66 Partners) raised net proceeds totaling $1.8 billion from equity and debt offerings. We used available cash to fund capital expenditures and investments of $1.8 billion, repurchase $1.6 billion of our common stock and pay dividends of $1.4 billion. We ended 2017 with $3.1 billion of cash and cash equivalents and approximately $5.8 billion of total committed capacity available under both our and Phillips 66 Partners’ credit facilities. We continue to focus on the following strategic priorities:•Operating Excellence. Our commitment to operating excellence guides everything we do. We are committed to protecting the health and safety of everyone who has a role in our operations and the communities in which we operate. Continuous improvement in safety, environmental stewardship, reliability and cost efficiency is a fundamental requirement for our company and employees. We employ rigorous training and audit programs to drive ongoing improvement in both personal and process safety as we strive for zero incidents. We achieved a record-low combined injury rate in 2017. Since we cannot control commodity prices, controlling operating expenses and overhead costs, within the context of our commitment to safety and environmental stewardship, is a high priority. Senior management actively monitors these costs. We are committed to protecting the environment and strive to reduce our environmental footprint throughout our operations. Optimizing utilization rates at our refineries through reliable and safe operations enables us to capture the value available in the market in terms of prices and margins. During 2017, our worldwide refining crude oil capacity utilization rate was 95 percent. •Growth. We have budgeted $2.3 billion in capital expenditures and investments in 2018, including $0.6 billion for Phillips 66 Partners. Additionally, our share of expected capital spending by joint ventures DCP Midstream, LLC (DCP Midstream), Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC (CPChem) and WRB Refining LP (WRB) in 2018 is $0.9 billion. In Midstream, we plan to invest in our Transportation and NGL businesses, focusing on projects integrated with our existing assets and infrastructure. In Chemicals, CPChem’s capital expenditures are expected to decrease due to completion of its U.S. Gulf Coast Petrochemicals Project. The two polyethylene units started up in September 2017, while commissioning of the ethane cracker is expected to begin in the first 32Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statementsquarter of 2018. Growth capital in Refining will be directed toward small, high-return, quick-payout projects primarily to increase clean product yields, while in Marketing and Specialties (M&S) it will be directed primarily towards increasing our retail sites in Europe.•Returns. We plan to improve refining returns by increasing throughput of advantaged feedstocks, disciplined capital allocation and portfolio optimization. A disciplined capital allocation process ensures we focus investments in projects that generate competitive returns throughout the business cycle. In 2017, we improved clean product yield in Refining, and in M&S, we continued to enhance our network and brand by re-imaging sites in the United States, while growing our number of sites in Europe. •Distributions. We believe shareholder value is enhanced through, among other things, consistent growth of regular dividends, complemented by share repurchases. We increased our quarterly dividend rate by 11 percent during 2017, and have increased it 250 percent since the company’s inception in 2012. Regular dividends demonstrate the confidence our Board of Directors and management have in our capital structure and operations’ capability to generate free cash flow throughout the business cycle. In 2017, we repurchased $1.6 billion, or approximately 18.7 million shares, of our common stock. Also, in October 2017, our Board of Directors authorized up to $3 billion of additional share repurchases. At the discretion of our Board of Directors, we plan to increase dividends annually and fund our share repurchase program while continuing to invest in the growth of our business. •High-Performing Organization. We strive to attract, develop and retain individuals with the knowledge and skills to implement our business strategy and who support our values and culture. Throughout the company, we focus on getting results in the right way and believe success is both what we do and how we do it.

The discount for the U.S. crude oil benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) versus the international benchmark Brent widened over much of 2017, initially related to extended production cuts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and certain non-OPEC countries, but further widened with Hurricane Harvey and logistical issues at the Cushing, Oklahoma, trading hub. Over the course of 2017, commodity prices had both favorable and unfavorable impacts on our businesses that vary by segment. Net income in the Midstream segment, which includes our 50 percent equity investment in DCP Midstream, is closely linked to natural gas liquids (NGL) prices, natural gas prices and crude oil prices. Average natural gas prices increased in 2017, compared with 2016, due to higher demand and low production in early 2017. In the fourth quarter of 2017, natural gas prices gained momentum with colder temperatures and increased residential and commercial heating demand. Total U.S. natural gas production also increased through the fourth quarter of 2017, largely from dry gas in the Marcellus play and associated gas from the Permian Basin. NGL prices improved throughout 2017 due to international demand. The Chemicals segment consists of our 50 percent equity investment in CPChem. The chemicals and plastics industry is mainly a commodity-based industry where the margins for key products are based on supply and demand, as well as cost factors. During 2017, the chemicals and plastics industry continued to benefit from feedstock cost advantages associated with manufacturing ethylene in regions of the world with significant NGL production. The price of crude oil is rising faster than NGL prices and thus the petrochemicals industry continues to experience lower ethylene cash costs in regions of the world where ethylene manufacturing is based upon NGL rather than crude oil-derived feedstocks. In particular, companies with North American ethane-based crackers have benefited and have captured a somewhat higher polyethylene chain margin. The ethylene-to-polyethylene chain margins expanded in 2017 because of the crude oil price recovery after the significant decline in oil prices that began in 2014.Our Refining segment results are driven by several factors, including refining margins, cost control, refinery throughput, feedstock costs, product yields and turnaround activity. Industry crack spread indicators, the difference between market prices for refined products and crude oil, are used to estimate refining margins. During 2017, the U.S. 3:2:1 crack spread (three barrels of crude oil producing two barrels of gasoline and one barrel of diesel) strengthened across all quarters, compared with 2016, largely attributable to higher product demand and lower product inventories in the last half of 2017 due to Hurricane Harvey. Northwest European crack spreads on average increased in 2017, compared with 2016, also due to higher demand.Results for our M&S segment depend largely on marketing fuel margins, lubricant margins, and other specialty product margins. While M&S margins are primarily driven by market factors, largely determined by the relationship between supply and demand, marketing fuel margins, in particular, are influenced by the trend in spot prices for refined products. Generally speaking, a downward trend of spot prices has a favorable impact on marketing fuel margins, while an upward trend of spot prices has an unfavorable impact on marketing fuel margins. Spot prices moved upward in 2017, following the increase in crude oil prices.34Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsRESULTS OF OPERATIONSBasis of PresentationDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, the segment performance measure used by our chief executive officer to assess performance and allocate resources was changed from “net income attributable to Phillips 66” to “net income.” This change reflects the recognition that management does not differentiate between those earnings attributable to Phillips 66 and those attributable to noncontrolling interests when making operating and resource allocation decisions impacting segment performance. Prior period segment information has been recast to conform to the current presentation.

(MSLP).•Improved equity earnings from affiliates in our Midstream segment.These increases were partially offset by:•Increased costs due to Hurricane Harvey, primarily impacting CPChem in our Chemicals segment. •Lower realized marketing margins.•Higher interest and debt expense.35Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements2016 vs. 2015 Our earnings decreased $2,672 million, or 63 percent, in 2016, primarily resulting from: •Lower realized refining margins.•Lower olefins and polyolefins margins.•Recognition in 2015 of $242 million of the deferred gain related to the sale in 2013 of the Immingham Combined Heat and Power Plant (ICHP).These decreases were partially offset by:•Improved results from DCP Midstream, primarily as a result of goodwill and other asset impairments recorded in 2015. See the “Segment Results” section for additional information on our segment results.Income Statement Analysis2017 vs. 2016 Sales and other operating revenues and purchased crude oil and products increased 21 percent and 27 percent, respectively, in 2017. The increases were primarily due to higher prices for petroleum products, crude oil and NGL. Equity in earnings of affiliates increased 22 percent in 2017, primarily resulting from higher equity in earnings from DCP Midstream and other affiliates in our Midstream segment, as well as WRB, partially offset by lower results from CPChem.•Equity in earnings from our Midstream segment increased $270 million due to improved results from DCP Midstream, primarily driven by improved margins, as well as higher equity in earnings from our Transportation affiliates, including our joint ventures that own the Bakken Pipeline, which started commercial operations in June 2017.•Equity in earnings of WRB increased $207 million, primarily due to higher market crack spreads, partially offset by lower feedstock advantage.•Equity in earnings of CPChem decreased $120 million, primarily due to hurricane-related costs and downtime.Other income increased $447 million in 2017. We recognized a noncash, pre-tax gain of $423 million in February 2017 related to the consolidation of MSLP. See Note 5—Business Combinations, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. Operating expenses increased 10 percent in 2017. This increase was mainly due to the consolidation of a transportation joint venture in December 2016, as well as higher refining turnaround expenses and utility costs, pension settlement expense, and costs associated with a full year of operations at the Freeport LPG Export Terminal. These increases were partially offset by lower costs due to the sale of the Whitegate Refinery in 2016. Depreciation and amortization increased 13 percent in 2017 due to the Freeport LPG Export Terminal beginning operations in late 2016, as well as other assets placed in service in 2017.Interest and debt expense increased 30 percent in 2017. This increase was primarily due to lower capitalized interest from the completion of major projects, including the startup of the Freeport LPG Export Terminal in late 2016, as well as higher average debt principal balances.36Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsIncome tax expense (benefit) was a benefit in 2017, compared with expense in 2016, primarily due to the $2,735 million provisional income tax benefit from the enactment of the Tax Act in December 2017. This benefit was partially offset by higher income tax expense from increased income before income taxes. See Note 21—Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for more information regarding our income taxes.Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest increased $53 million in 2017, reflecting the contribution of assets to Phillips 66 Partners during 2017 and late 2016. See Note 27—Phillips 66 Partners LP, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for more information.2016 vs. 2015 Sales and other operating revenues and purchased crude oil and products both decreased 15 percent in 2016. The decreases were primarily due to lower average prices for petroleum products and crude oil, while average NGL prices were slightly improved during 2016. Equity in earnings of affiliates decreased 10 percent in 2016, primarily resulting from decreased earnings from CPChem and WRB, partially offset by improved results from DCP Midstream.•Equity in earnings of CPChem decreased 37 percent, primarily due to lower realized olefins and polyolefins margins. •Equity in earnings of WRB decreased $186 million, mainly resulting from lower market crack spreads, partially offset by higher feedstock advantage.•Equity in earnings of DCP Midstream improved $426 million in 2016, primarily driven by goodwill and other asset impairments recorded by DCP Midstream in 2015.Net gain on dispositions decreased $273 million in 2016. In 2015, we recognized a $242 million deferred gain related to the sale of ICHP.

This segment includes our master limited partnership (MLP), Phillips 66 Partners, as well as our 50 percent equity investment in DCP Midstream, which includes the operations of its MLP, DCP Midstream, LP (DCP Partners).2017 vs. 2016 Net income from the Midstream segment increased $184 million in 2017, compared with 2016, due to improved results across all business lines. Transportation net income increased $65 million in 2017, compared with 2016. The improvement was mainly driven by increased equity in earnings from affiliates, including our joint ventures that own the Bakken Pipeline, which started commercial operations in June 2017, as well as Rockies Express Pipeline LLC (REX) due to our share of a favorable breach of contract settlement claim. These increases were partially offset by higher operating costs. 38Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsNet income from our NGL and Other business increased $41 million in 2017, compared with 2016. The increase reflects a full year of operations at the Freeport LPG Export Terminal, the contribution of MSLP to Phillips 66 Partners in October 2017, and higher equity earnings from DCP Sand Hills Pipeline, LLC (Sand Hills), partially offset by lower realized margins.Net income from our investment in DCP Midstream improved $78 million in 2017, compared with 2016. The increase was primarily due to improved margins driven by higher average NGL and natural gas prices, and improved results from DCP Midstream’s hedging program. See the “Business Environment and Executive Overview” section for information on market factors impacting 2017 results.2016 vs. 2015 Net income from the Midstream segment increased $206 million in 2016, compared with 2015. The increase was primarily due to improved results from DCP Midstream, partially offset by lower net income from our Transportation and NGL and Other businesses.Transportation net income decreased $24 million in 2016, compared with 2015. Lower net income primarily resulted from higher operating costs and increased depreciation expense due to growth projects. These items were partially offset by higher revenues from increased throughput volumes and higher tariffs. Net income from our NGL and Other business decreased $61 million in 2016, compared with 2015. The decrease was primarily driven by lower realized margins, as well as increased depreciation and operating expenses associated with the Sweeny Fractionator and, late in the year, the Freeport LPG Export Terminal. These items were partially offset by higher fractionated volumes, reflecting the operation of the Sweeny Fractionator for a full year in 2016, and the benefit of the first liquefied petroleum gas cargos exported from the Freeport LPG Export Terminal in late 2016. Improved results from our investment in DCP Midstream increased our net income by $291 million in 2016, compared with 2015. In 2015, DCP Midstream recorded goodwill and other asset impairments, which reduced our net income by $232 million. In addition, favorable contract restructuring efforts, improved asset performance, higher equity in earnings from DCP Midstream’s equity affiliates, lower operating costs and higher NGL prices contributed to better results in 2016. These improvements were partially offset by lower natural gas and crude oil prices. 39Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsChemicals Year Ended December 31 2017 2016 2015 Millions of Dollars Net Income$525 583 962 Millions of PoundsCPChem Externally Marketed Sales Volumes* Olefins and Polyolefins15,870 16,011 16,916Specialties, Aromatics and Styrenics4,618 4,911 5,301 20,488 20,922 22,217* Represents 100 percent of CPChem’s outside sales of produced petrochemical products, as well as commission sales from equity affiliates. Olefins and Polyolefins Capacity Utilization (percent)*87% 91 92The Chemicals segment consists of our 50 percent interest in CPChem, which we account for under the equity method. CPChem uses NGL and other feedstocks to produce petrochemicals. These products are then marketed and sold or used as feedstocks to produce plastics and other chemicals. We structure our reporting of CPChem’s operations around two primary business segments: Olefins and Polyolefins (O&P) and Specialties, Aromatics and Styrenics (SA&S). The O&P business segment produces and markets ethylene and other olefin products. Ethylene produced is primarily consumed within CPChem for the production of polyethylene, normal alpha olefins and polyethylene pipe. The SA&S business segment manufactures and markets aromatics and styrenics products, such as benzene, styrene, paraxylene and cyclohexane, as well as polystyrene. SA&S also manufactures and/or markets a variety of specialty chemical products. Unless otherwise noted, amounts referenced below reflect our net 50 percent interest in CPChem.2017 vs. 2016 Net income from the Chemicals segment decreased $58 million in 2017, compared with 2016. The decrease was primarily driven by higher costs and lower volumes due to Hurricane Harvey, as well as lower margins. These items were partially offset by lower impairment charges, higher equity in earnings from an O&P affiliate due to lower turnaround costs and a gain on the sale of CPChem’s K-Resin® styrene-butadiene copolymers business. CPChem recognized impairment charges of $127 million and $177 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively, due to lower demand and margin factors. As a result of these impairments, net income of the Chemicals segment was reduced by $39 million and $89 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively.As a result of Hurricane Harvey, CPChem’s Cedar Bayou facility in Baytown, Texas, experienced severe flooding, which caused it to shut down operations in the third quarter of 2017. This facility restarted in phases during the fourth quarter of 2017. CPChem’s U.S. Gulf Coast Petrochemicals Project, which consists of an ethane cracker at Cedar Bayou and two polyethylene units at Old Ocean, Texas, was also impacted by the flooding. CPChem achieved mechanical completion of its ethane cracker at the Cedar Bayou facility in December 2017, and is expected to complete commissioning of the ethane cracker in the first quarter of 2018, with a transition to full production in the second quarter of 2018.See the “Business Environment and Executive Overview” section for information on market factors impacting CPChem’s results.40Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements2016 vs. 2015Net income from the Chemicals segment decreased $379 million in 2016, compared with 2015. The decrease in net income was primarily due to lower realized margins from the O&P business, driven by a decline in sales prices for polyethylene and normal alpha olefins (NAO) and higher feedstock costs, as well as impacts from increased turnaround activity. Lower equity earnings from CPChem’s equity affiliates and lower SA&S volumes further reduced net income in 2016. In addition, CPChem recognized a $177 million impairment in 2016 due to lower demand and margin factors affecting an equity affiliate, which resulted in an $89 million after-tax reduction in our equity earnings from CPChem. Our equity in earnings from CPChem were reduced by $24 million in 2015 as a result of an impairment CPChem recognized on an equity affiliate. These items were partially offset by higher NAO and polyethylene sales volumes and improved SA&S margins.Refining Year Ended December 31 2017 2016 2015 Millions of DollarsNet Income (Loss) Atlantic Basin/Europe$370 204 569Gulf Coast512 52 551Central Corridor477 234 857West Coast45 (116) 578Worldwide$1,404 374 2,555 Dollars Per BarrelNet Income (Loss) Atlantic Basin/Europe$1.86 0.93 2.68Gulf Coast1.79 0.18 2.08Central Corridor5.18 2.38 8.96West Coast0.34 (0.92) 4.42Worldwide1.97 0.51 3.63 Realized Refining Margins Atlantic Basin/Europe$8.25 6.26 9.39Gulf Coast7.07 5.49 9.29Central Corridor12.44 8.70 14.88West Coast10.49 9.15 16.86Worldwide9.13 6.99 11.8441Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements Thousands of Barrels Daily Year Ended December 31 2017 2016 2015Operating Statistics Refining operations* Atlantic Basin/Europe Crude oil capacity520 566 588Crude oil processed494 568 539Capacity utilization (percent)95% 100 92Refinery production553 607 587Gulf Coast Crude oil capacity743 743 738Crude oil processed709 704 654Capacity utilization (percent)95% 95 89Refinery production789 783 733Central Corridor Crude oil capacity493 493 492Crude oil processed467 485 465Capacity utilization (percent)95% 98 95Refinery production489 506 486West Coast Crude oil capacity360 360 360Crude oil processed342 318 330Capacity utilization (percent)95% 88 92Refinery production368 345 359Worldwide Crude oil capacity2,116 2,162 2,178Crude oil processed2,012 2,075 1,988Capacity utilization (percent)95% 96 91Refinery production2,199 2,241 2,165* Includes our share of equity affiliates. The Refining segment refines crude oil and other feedstocks into petroleum products (such as gasoline, distillates and aviation fuels) at 13 refineries in the United States and Europe. 2017 vs. 2016 Net income for the Refining segment increased $1,030 million in 2017, compared with 2016. The increase was primarily due to higher realized refining margins and West Coast volumes, as well as an after-tax gain of $261 million recognized on the consolidation of MSLP, partially offset by higher turnaround expenses, utilities costs and pension settlement expense. The higher realized refining margins primarily resulted from improved market crack spreads and secondary product margins, partially offset by lower feedstock advantage. See the “Business Environment and Executive Overview” section for information on industry crack spreads and other market factors impacting this year’s results. In addition, see Note 5—Business Combinations and Note 27—Phillips 66 Partners LP, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information on the consolidation of MSLP in February 2017 and the subsequent contribution of our ownership interest in MSLP to Phillips 66 Partners in October 2017, respectively. Our worldwide refining crude oil capacity utilization rate was 95 percent in 2017, compared with 96 percent in 2016. The decrease was primarily attributable to higher turnaround activities and unplanned downtime, partially offset by improved market conditions.42Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements2016 vs. 2015 Net income for the Refining segment decreased $2,181 million in 2016, compared with 2015. Lower net income in 2016 reflected lower realized refining margins resulting from decreased market crack spreads, higher costs associated with renewable fuels blending activities, lower clean product differentials and lower feedstock advantage. These items were partially offset by higher volumes due to lower turnaround activities and less unplanned downtime. Our worldwide refining crude oil capacity utilization rate was 96 percent in 2016, compared with 91 percent in 2015. The increase was primarily attributable to lower turnaround activities and less unplanned downtime. Non-GAAP ReconciliationsOur realized refining margins measure the difference between a) sales and other operating revenues derived from the sale of petroleum products manufactured at our refineries and b) purchase costs of feedstocks, primarily crude oil, used to produce the petroleum products. The margins are adjusted to include our proportional share of our joint-venture refineries’ realized margins, as well as to exclude those items that are not representative of the underlying operating performance of a period, which we call “special items.” The realized refining margins are converted to a per-barrel basis by dividing them by total refinery processed inputs (primarily crude oil) measured on a barrel basis, including our share of inputs processed by our joint-venture refineries. Our realized refining margin per barrel is intended to be comparable with industry refining margins, which are known as “crack spreads.” As discussed in “Business Environment,” industry crack spreads measure the difference between market prices for refined petroleum products and crude oil. Realized refining margin per barrel calculated on a similar basis as industry crack spreads provides a useful measure of how well we performed relative to benchmark industry margins.Under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), the performance measure most directly comparable to refining margin per barrel is the Refining segment’s “net income per barrel.” Refining margin per barrel excludes items that are typically included in a manufacturer’s gross margin, such as depreciation and operating expenses, and other items used to determine net income, such as general and administrative expenses and income taxes. It also includes our proportional share of joint-venture refineries’ realized margins and excludes special items. Because refining margin per barrel is calculated in this manner, and because refining margin per barrel may be defined differently by other companies in our industry, it has limitations as an analytical tool. Following are reconciliations of net income to realized refining margins:43Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements Millions of Dollars, Except as IndicatedRealized Refining MarginsAtlantic Basin/EuropeGulfCoastCentral CorridorWestCoastWorldwide Year Ended December 31, 2017 Net income $370512477451,404Plus: Income tax expense7829727819672Taxes other than income taxes56974664263Depreciation, amortization and impairments192273129244838Selling, general and administrative expenses61553448198Operating expenses8471,2125939823,634Equity in (earnings) losses of affiliates11(4)(329)—(322)Other segment (income) expense, net(10)(421)135(413)Proportional share of refining gross margins contributed by equity affiliates591959—1,019Special items: Certain tax impacts(23)———(23)Realized refining margins$1,6412,0222,2001,4077,270 Total processed inputs (thousands of barrels)199,068285,95192,146134,089711,254Adjusted total processed inputs (thousands of barrels)*199,068285,951176,823134,089795,931 Net income per barrel (dollars per barrel)**$1.861.795.180.341.97Realized refining margins (dollars per barrel)***8.257.0712.4410.499.13 Year Ended December 31, 2016 Net income (loss)$20452234(116)374Plus: Income tax expense (benefit)(17)17133(72)61Taxes other than income taxes58734280253Depreciation, amortization and impairments200234106230770Selling, general and administrative expenses64513149195Operating expenses8171,2344659793,495Equity in (earnings) losses of affiliates8(50)(122)—(164)Other segment (income) expense, net(11)3(6)(2)(16)Proportional share of refining gross margins contributed by equity affiliates55(4)705—756Special items: Pending claims and settlements—(70)——(70)Certain tax impacts(32)———(32)Railcar lease residual value deficiencies and related costs51611840Recognition of deferred logistics commitments30———30Realized refining margins$1,3811,5561,5991,1565,692 Total processed inputs (thousands of barrels)220,519283,57498,217126,329728,639Adjusted total processed inputs (thousands of barrels)*220,519283,574183,691126,329814,113 Net income (loss) per barrel (dollars per barrel)**$0.930.182.38(0.92)0.51Realized refining margins (dollars per barrel)***6.265.498.709.156.99 * Adjusted total processed inputs include our proportional share of processed inputs of an equity affiliate. ** Net income (loss) divided by total processed inputs.*** Realized refining margins per barrel, as presented, are calculated using the underlying realized refining margin amounts, in dollars, divided by adjusted total processed inputs, in barrels.

In addition, this segment includes the manufacturing and marketing of specialty products (such as base oils and lubricants), as well as power generation operations. 2017 vs. 2016 Net income from the M&S segment decreased $205 million in 2017, compared with 2016. The decrease was primarily due to lower realized marketing margins, as well as the absence of biofuel tax credits and a favorable income tax adjustment recognized in 2016. See the “Business Environment and Executive Overview” section for information on marketing fuel margins and other market factors impacting 2016 results.2016 vs. 2015Net income from the M&S segment decreased $296 million in 2016, compared with 2015. The decrease was mainly attributable to the $242 million deferred gain recognized in 2015 related to the 2013 ICHP sale. See Note 6—Assets Held for Sale or Sold, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. 46Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsAlso contributing to the lower net income in 2016 were lower realized marketing margins driven by an upward trend of spot prices during most of 2016, and lower margins and volumes in lubricants. These decreases were partially offset by favorable tax adjustments and higher marketing volumes. Non-GAAP ReconciliationsOur realized marketing fuel margins measure the difference between a) sales and other operating revenues derived from the sale of fuels in our M&S segment and b) purchase costs of those fuels. These margins are converted to a per-barrel basis by dividing them by sales volumes measured on a barrel basis. Marketing fuel margin per barrel demonstrates the value uplift our marketing operations provide by optimizing the placement and ultimate sale of our refineries’ fuel production. Within the M&S segment, the GAAP performance measure most directly comparable to marketing fuel margin per barrel is the marketing business’ “net income per barrel.” Marketing fuel margin per barrel excludes items that are typically included in gross margin, such as depreciation and operating expenses, and other items used to determine net income, such as general and administrative expenses and income taxes. Because marketing fuel margin per barrel excludes these items, and because marketing fuel margin per barrel may be defined differently by other companies in our industry, it has limitations as an analytical tool.

Net interest expense increased $56 million in 2017, compared with 2016, primarily due to lower capitalized interest as a result of the Freeport LPG Export Terminal beginning operations in late 2016, and higher interest expense driven by higher average debt principal balances, reflecting Phillips 66 Partners’ debt issuances in October 2017 and 2016. The Tax Act was enacted on December 22, 2017. The material provisions of the Tax Act i) reduced the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent beginning January 1, 2018, ii) imposed a one-time deemed repatriation tax on foreign-sourced earnings that were previously tax deferred, and iii) created a new tax regime on post-2017 foreign-sourced earnings. We have not yet completed our accounting for the income tax effects of the Tax Act as of December 31, 2017, but have made reasonable estimates of those effects on our existing deferred income tax balances and the one-time deemed repatriation tax. We recognized a provisional income tax benefit of $2,735 million, which is included in the “Income tax expense (benefit)” line on our consolidated statement of income. We have included these one-time impacts of the Tax Act in Corporate and Other. Of the provisional income tax benefit recognized, $2,870 million was associated with the revaluation of our existing deferred tax assets and liabilities, and $14 million reflected higher manufacturing deductions, which was an indirect benefit of the Tax Act. These benefits were partially offset by the one-time deemed repatriation tax estimate of $149 million. We expect the Tax Act to significantly lower our effective tax rates in 2018 and future years for both our consolidated operations and each of our operating segments. See Note 21—Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for more information. 2016 vs. 2015Net interest expense increased $24 million in 2016, compared with 2015, mainly due to lower capitalized interest. The category “Other” includes certain income tax expenses, environmental costs associated with sites no longer in operation, foreign currency transaction gains and losses and other costs not directly associated with an operating segment. The decrease in other costs in 2016 was primarily attributable to favorable tax impacts and the write-off of certain fixed assets during 2015, partially offset by higher environmental accruals. 48Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsCAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITYFinancial Indicators Millions of Dollars, Except as Indicated 2017 2016 2015 Cash and cash equivalents$3,119 2,711 3,074Net cash provided by operating activities3,648 2,963 5,713Short-term debt41 550 44Total debt10,110 10,138 8,887Total equity27,428 23,725 23,938Percent of total debt to capital*27% 30 27Percent of floating-rate debt to total debt11% 3 1* Capital includes total debt and total equity.To meet our short- and long-term liquidity requirements, we look to a variety of funding sources but rely primarily on cash generated from operating activities. Additionally, Phillips 66 Partners raises funds for its growth activities through debt and equity financings. During 2017, we generated $3.6 billion in cash from operations. Phillips 66 Partners completed the private placement of perpetual convertible preferred units and common units and the public offering of senior notes and common units for net proceeds totaling $1.8 billion. We used this available cash primarily for capital expenditures and investments of $1.8 billion; repurchases of our common stock of $1.6 billion; and dividend payments on our common stock of $1.4 billion. During 2017, cash and cash equivalents increased by $0.4 billion, to $3.1 billion.In addition to cash flows from operating activities, we rely on our commercial paper and credit facility programs, asset sales and our ability to issue securities using our shelf registration statement to support our short- and long-term liquidity requirements. We believe current cash and cash equivalents and cash generated by operations, together with access to external sources of funds as described below under “Significant Sources of Capital,” will be sufficient to meet our funding requirements in the near and long term, including our capital spending, dividend payments, defined benefit plan contributions, debt repayment and share repurchases. Significant Sources of CapitalOperating ActivitiesDuring 2017, cash of $3,648 million was provided by operating activities, a 23 percent increase compared with 2016. The increase was primarily attributable to increased operating results due to higher realized refining margins and distributions from our equity affiliates. This increase was partially offset by working capital changes, reflecting the negative impact of building inventory at higher commodity prices and timing of refining payables payments, as well as lower marketing margins. During 2016, cash of $2,963 million was provided by operating activities, a 48 percent decrease compared with 2015. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower realized refining margins, as well as a reduction in distributions from our equity affiliates. This decrease was partially offset by positive working capital of $501 million in 2016 compared to a negative working capital impact of $221 million in 2015. The positive working capital impact in 2016 was primarily driven by increased refining payables, due to an increase in feedstock costs at the end of 2016 as compared with 2015, and the timing of tax payments and refunds, partially offset by an increase in receivables, resulting from higher commodity prices. Our short- and long-term operating cash flows are highly dependent upon refining and marketing margins, NGL prices and chemicals margins. Prices and margins in our industry are typically volatile, and are driven by market conditions over which we have little or no control. Absent other mitigating factors, as these prices and margins fluctuate, we would expect a corresponding change in our operating cash flows.49Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsThe level and quality of output from our refineries also impacts our cash flows. Factors such as operating efficiency, maintenance turnarounds, market conditions, feedstock availability and weather conditions can affect output. We actively manage the operations of our refineries, and any variability in their operations typically has not been as significant to cash flows as that caused by margins and prices. Our worldwide refining crude oil capacity utilization was 95 percent in 2017, compared with 96 percent in 2016.Equity AffiliatesOur operating cash flows are also impacted by distribution decisions made by our equity affiliates, including DCP Midstream, CPChem and WRB. Over the three years ended December 31, 2017, we received distributions of $107 million from DCP Midstream, $1,854 million from CPChem and $300 million from WRB. We cannot control the amount or timing of future distributions from equity affiliates; therefore, future distributions by these and other equity affiliates are not assured.Effective January 1, 2017, DCP Midstream and DCP Partners closed a transaction in which DCP Midstream contributed subsidiaries owning all of its operating assets, $424 million of cash and $3.15 billion of debt to DCP Partners, in exchange for DCP Partners units which had an estimated fair value of $1.125 billion at the time of the transaction. We and our co-venturer retained our 50/50 investment in DCP Midstream, and DCP Midstream retained its incentive distribution rights (IDRs) in DCP Partners through its ownership of the general partner of DCP Partners. After the transaction, DCP Midstream held a 36 percent limited partner interest and a 2 percent general partner interest in DCP Partners. DCP Midstream, through its ownership of the general partner, has agreed, if required, to forgo receipt of IDRs up to $100 million annually (100 percent basis) through 2019, to support a minimum distribution coverage ratio for DCP Partners. In connection with the transaction, DCP Midstream terminated its revolving credit agreement, which had previously served to limit distributions to its owners while amounts had been borrowed under the facility. As a result, distributions to the owners of DCP Midstream resumed in 2017. In 2015, CPChem made a special distribution to its owners, with our share totaling $696 million. CPChem funded the distribution by issuing $1.4 billion of senior notes with maturities ranging from three to five years, with a combination of fixed and floating interest rates. This cash inflow from CPChem was included in operating cash flows, as we had cumulative undistributed equity earnings attributable to CPChem in excess of the amount distributed. We did not receive any distributions from CPChem in the second half of 2017 due to the impacts of Hurricane Harvey on its Gulf Coast operations and its U.S. Gulf Coast Petrochemicals Project. We expect distributions from CPChem to resume in 2018.Foreign Cash HoldingsWith the passage of the Tax Act in December 2017, we are subject to a one-time deemed repatriation tax on foreign-sourced earnings. For a portion of those foreign earnings, we had previously deferred any associated U.S. income taxes. As a result of the Tax Act, we now have the ability to utilize a greater percentage of our worldwide cash and cash equivalents for domestic purposes without incurring additional material U.S. income taxes beyond those imposed by the one-time deemed repatriation tax, thereby improving the flexibility of our worldwide cash management system. We expect a portion of our foreign cash holdings will be reserved exclusively for foreign use in support of those operations and local statutory and regulatory requirements; however, that amount is not expected to materially impact our liquidity. Additionally, we do not expect the payment of the one-time deemed repatriation tax to materially impact our liquidity. Phillips 66 PartnersIn 2013, we formed Phillips 66 Partners, a publicly traded MLP, to own, operate, develop and acquire primarily fee-based crude oil, refined petroleum products, and NGL pipelines and terminals, as well as other Midstream assets.OwnershipAt December 31, 2017, we owned a 55 percent limited partner interest and a 2 percent general partner interest in Phillips 66 Partners, while its public unitholders owned a 43 percent limited partner interest and 13.8 million perpetual convertible preferred units. We consolidate Phillips 66 Partners as a variable interest entity for financial reporting purposes. See Note 3—Variable Interest Entities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information on why we consolidate the partnership. As a result of this consolidation, the public common and preferred unitholders’ interests in Phillips 66 Partners are reflected as noncontrolling interests in our consolidated balance sheet, and totaled $2,314 million at December 31, 2017. Generally, drop down transactions to Phillips 66 Partners will eliminate in consolidation, except for third-party debt or third-party equity offerings made by Phillips 66 Partners to finance such transactions. As a result of Phillips 66 Partners’ third-party debt and equity offerings in 2017, primarily 50Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statementsrelated to the contribution of assets in October 2017, our consolidated cash increased by $1,848 million and consolidated debt increased by $643 million. Debt and Equity FinancingsDuring the three years ended December 31, 2017, Phillips 66 Partners raised net proceeds of approximately $5.4 billion from the following third-party debt and equity offerings:•In October 2017, Phillips 66 Partners received net proceeds of $643 million from the issuance of $500 million of 3.750% Senior Notes due 2028 and $150 million of 4.680% Senior Notes due 2045.•In October 2017, Phillips 66 Partners received net proceeds of $737 million from a private placement of 13,819,791 perpetual convertible preferred units, at a price of $54.27 per unit.•In October 2017, Phillips 66 Partners received net proceeds of $295 million from a private placement of 6,304,204 common units, at a price of $47.59 per unit.•In October 2016, Phillips 66 Partners received net proceeds of $1,111 million from the issuance of $500 million of 3.550% Senior Notes due 2026 and $625 million of 4.900% Senior Notes due 2046.•In August 2016, Phillips 66 Partners received net proceeds of $299 million from a public offering of 6,000,000 common units, at a price of $50.22 per unit.•In June 2016, Phillips 66 Partners began issuing common units under a continuous offering program, which allows for the offering of up to $250 million of common units. Through December 31, 2017, net proceeds of $192 million had been received under this program.•In May 2016, Phillips 66 Partners received net proceeds of $656 million from a public offering of 12,650,000 common units, at a price of $52.40 per unit.•In February 2015, Phillips 66 Partners received net proceeds of $1,092 million from the issuance of $300 million of 2.646% Senior Notes due 2020, $500 million of 3.605% Senior Notes due 2025, and $300 million of 4.680% Senior Notes due 2045.•In February 2015, Phillips 66 Partners received net proceeds of $384 million from a public offering of 5,250,000 million common units, at a price of $75.50 per unit.Phillips 66 Partners primarily used these net proceeds to fund the cash portion of acquisitions of assets from Phillips 66. See Note 27—Phillips 66 Partners LP, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information on Phillips 66 Partners and additional details on assets contributed to the partnership by us during 2017.Phillips 66 Partners filed a new shelf registration statement for a second continuous offering program that became effective with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on January 23, 2018, related to the continuous offering of up to an aggregate of $250 million of common units, in amounts, at prices and on terms to be determined by the market conditions and other factors at the time of the offerings.Credit Facilities and Commercial PaperPhillips 66 has a $5.0 billion revolving credit facility that extends until October 2021. This facility may be used for direct bank borrowings, as support for issuances of letters of credit, or as support for our commercial paper program. The facility is with a broad syndicate of financial institutions and contains covenants that we consider usual and customary for an agreement of this type for comparable commercial borrowers, including a maximum consolidated net debt-to-capitalization ratio of 60 percent. The agreement has customary events of default, such as nonpayment of principal when due; nonpayment of interest, fees or other amounts; violation of covenants; cross-payment default and cross-acceleration (in each case, to indebtedness in excess of a threshold amount); and a change of control. Borrowings under the facility will incur interest at the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a margin based on the credit rating of our senior unsecured long-term debt as determined from time to time by Standard & Poor’s (S&P) Ratings 51Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsServices and Moody’s Investors Service. The facility also provides for customary fees, including administrative agent fees and commitment fees. At December 31, 2017, no amount had been drawn under this revolving credit agreement.We have a $5.0 billion commercial paper program for short-term working capital needs that is supported by our revolving credit facility. Commercial paper maturities are generally limited to 90 days. At December 31, 2017, we had no borrowings under our commercial paper program.Phillips 66 Partners has a $750 million revolving credit facility that extends until October 2021. The Phillips 66 Partners facility is with a broad syndicate of financial institutions. At December 31, 2017, Phillips 66 Partners had no borrowings outstanding under this facility.Other Debt Issuances and FinancingsIn April 2017, Phillips 66 completed a private offering of $600 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured notes, consisting of $300 million of Notes due 2019 and $300 million of Notes due 2020. Interest on the notes is a floating rate equal to three-month LIBOR plus 0.65% per annum for the 2019 Notes and three-month LIBOR plus 0.75% per annum for the 2020 Notes. Interest on both series of notes is payable quarterly in arrears on January 15, April 15, July 15 and October 15, commencing in July 2017. The 2019 Notes mature on April 15, 2019, and the 2020 Notes mature on April 15, 2020. Also in April 2017, Phillips 66 entered into term loan facilities with an aggregate borrowing amount of $900 million, consisting of a $450 million 364-day facility and a $450 million three-year facility. Interest on the term loans is a floating rate based on either the Eurodollar rate or the reference rate, plus a margin determined by our long-term credit ratings. Phillips 66 used the net proceeds from the issuance of the notes, together with the proceeds from the term loans, and cash on-hand to repay its outstanding 2.950% Senior Notes upon maturity in May 2017.In October 2017, as part of the contribution of assets to Phillips 66 Partners, discussed above, Phillips 66 Partners assumed the $450 million term loan outstanding under the 364-day facility originally issued in April 2017, and subsequently repaid the loan. In addition, we have capital lease obligations related to equipment and transportation assets, and the use of an oil terminal in the United Kingdom. These leases mature within the next sixteen years. The present value of our minimum capital lease payments for these obligations as of December 31, 2017, was $192 million.Availability of Debt and Equity FinancingThe $6.0 billion of outstanding Senior Notes and $600 million of floating-rate notes issued by Phillips 66 are guaranteed by Phillips 66 Company, a 100-percent-owned subsidiary. Our senior unsecured long-term debt has been rated investment grade by S&P (BBB+) and Moody’s (A3). We do not have any ratings triggers on any of our corporate debt that would cause an automatic default, and thereby impact our access to liquidity, in the event of a downgrade of our credit rating. If our credit rating deteriorated to a level prohibiting us from accessing the commercial paper market, we would expect to be able to access funds under our liquidity facilities mentioned above.In addition, we have a universal shelf registration statement on file with the SEC under which we, as a well-known seasoned issuer, have the ability to issue and sell an indeterminate amount of various types of debt and equity securities.52Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsOff-Balance Sheet ArrangementsUnder the operating lease agreement on our headquarters facility in Houston, Texas, we have a residual value guarantee with a maximum future exposure of $554 million. The operating lease has a term of five years and provides us the option, at the end of the lease term, to request to renew the lease, purchase the facility, or assist the lessor in marketing it for resale. We also have residual value guarantees associated with railcar and airplane leases with maximum future potential payments of $305 million. For information on our need to perform under the railcar lease guarantee, see the “Capital Requirements” section to follow.In addition, we have guarantees outstanding related to certain joint-venture debt obligations, which have remaining terms of up to eight years. The maximum potential amount of future payments to third parties under these guarantees is approximately $308 million.See Note 13—Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information on our guarantees.Capital RequirementsCapital Expenditures and InvestmentsFor information about our capital expenditures and investments, see “Capital Spending” below.Debt FinancingOur debt balance at December 31, 2017, was $10.1 billion and our total debt-to-capital ratio was 27 percent. See Note 12—Debt, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for our annual debt maturities over the next five years.DividendsOn February 7, 2018, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.70 per common share, payable March 1, 2018, to holders of record at the close of business on February 20, 2018. Share RepurchasesSince July 2012, our Board of Directors has, at various times, authorized repurchases of our outstanding common stock which aggregate to a total authorization of up to $12.0 billion. The share repurchases are expected to be funded primarily through available cash. The shares will be repurchased from time to time in the open market at our discretion, subject to market conditions and other factors, and in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements. We are not obligated to acquire any particular amount of common stock and may commence, suspend or discontinue purchases at any time or from time to time without prior notice. Since the inception of our share repurchases in 2012, through December 31, 2017, we have repurchased a total of 124,142,530 shares at an aggregate cost of $9.0 billion. Shares of stock repurchased are held as treasury shares.On February 13, 2018, we entered into a Stock Purchase and Sale Agreement (Purchase Agreement) with Berkshire Hathaway Inc. and National Indemnity Company, a wholly owned subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway, to repurchase 35 million shares of Phillips 66 common stock for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $3.3 billion. Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, the purchase price per share of $93.725 was based on the volume-weighted-average price of our common stock on the New York Stock Exchange on February 13, 2018. The transaction closed on February 14, 2018. We funded the repurchase with cash on hand of approximately $1.9 billion and borrowings of approximately $1.4 billion under our commercial paper program. This specific share repurchase transaction was separately authorized by our Board of Directors and therefore does not impact previously announced authorizations which total up to $12.0 billion.53Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsRailcar and Airplane Leases Residual Value GuaranteesOn May 1, 2015, the U.S. Department of Transportation issued a final rule focused on the safe transportation of flammable liquids by rail. The final rule, which is being challenged, subjects new and existing railcars transporting crude oil in high volumes to heightened design standards, including thicker tank walls and heat shields, improved pressure relief valves and enhanced braking systems. We are currently evaluating the impact of the new regulations on our crude oil railcar fleet, which is mostly held under operating leases. The regulations become effective subsequent to the expiration dates of a portion of our leases. Some of our leases require a portion of the leased railcars to be retrofitted. Certain leases are subject to residual value guarantees. Under the lease terms, we have the option to either purchase the railcars or return them to the lessors. If railcars are returned to the lessors, we may be required to make the lessors whole under the residual value guarantees, which are subject to a cap. The current market demand for crude oil railcars is low, which has resulted in a decline in crude oil railcar prices. Based on third-party appraisals of the railcars’ fair value at the end of their lease terms, we estimated a total residual value deficiency of $109 million that would be payable at the end of the lease terms, with approximately one-half paid in late 2017 and the other half due in 2019. During 2017 and 2016, we recognized $73 million of expense related to the residual value deficiency of our leased railcars. In October 2017, upon maturity of one of our railcar leases, $53 million of the total residual value deficiency of $109 million was settled. The residual value deficiency of $36 million remaining at December 31, 2017, will be recognized on a straight-line basis through May 2019. Due to current market uncertainties, changes in the estimated fair values of railcars could occur, which could increase or decrease our currently estimated residual value deficiency. As of December 31, 2017, our maximum future exposure for residual value guarantees associated with our railcar and airplane leases was approximately $305 million. See Note 13—Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.54Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsContractual ObligationsThe following table summarizes our aggregate contractual fixed and variable obligations as of December 31, 2017: Millions of Dollars Payments Due by Period Total Up to1 Year Years2-3 Years4-5 After5 Years Debt obligations (a)$10,026 25 1,375 2,050 6,576Capital lease obligations192 16 27 22 127Total debt10,218 41 1,402 2,072 6,703Interest on debt7,371 436 839 765 5,331Operating lease obligations1,826 533 726 241 326Purchase obligations (b)77,683 32,236 9,554 6,698 29,195Other long-term liabilities (c) Asset retirement obligations268 7 30 18 213Accrued environmental costs458 78 117 72 191Unrecognized income tax benefits (d)1 1 (d) (d) (d)Total$97,825 33,332 12,668 9,866 41,959 (a)For additional information, see Note 12—Debt, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.(b)Represents any agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable, legally binding and specifies all significant terms. We expect these purchase obligations will be fulfilled by operating cash flows in the applicable maturity period. The majority of the purchase obligations are market-based contracts, including exchanges and futures, for the purchase of products such as crude oil and unfractionated NGL. The products are mostly used to supply our refineries and fractionators, optimize the supply chain, and resell to customers. Product purchase commitments with third parties totaled $35,480 million. In addition, $24,230 million are product purchases from CPChem, mostly for natural gas and NGL over the remaining contractual term of 82 years, and product purchases of $1,652 million from DCP entities for NGL over the remaining contractual term of three years. Purchase obligations of $5,097 million are related to agreements to access and utilize the capacity of third-party equipment and facilities, including pipelines and product terminals, to transport, process, treat, and store products. The remainder is primarily our net share of purchase commitments for materials and services for jointly owned facilities where we are the operator.(c)Excludes pensions. From 2018 through 2022, we expect to contribute an average of $70 million per year to our qualified and nonqualified pension and other postretirement benefit plans in the United States and an average of $34 million per year to our non-U.S. plans, which are expected to be in excess of required minimums in many cases. The U.S. five-year average consists of $60 million for 2018 and then approximately $75 million per year for the remaining four years. Our minimum funding in 2018 is expected to be $60 million in the United States and $35 million outside the United States.(d)Excludes unrecognized income tax benefits of $33 million because the ultimate disposition and timing of any payments to be made with regard to such amounts are not reasonably estimable or the amounts relate to potential refunds. Also excludes interest and penalties of $8 million. Although unrecognized income tax benefits are not a contractual obligation, they are presented in this table because they represent potential demands on our liquidity.55Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsCapital Spending Millions of Dollars 2018Budget 2017 2016 2015Capital Expenditures and Investments Midstream$1,218 771 1,453 4,457Chemicals— — — —Refining827 853 1,149 1,069Marketing and Specialties140 108 98 122Corporate and Other116 100 144 116$2,301 1,832 2,844 5,764 Selected Equity Affiliates* DCP Midstream$405 268 99 438CPChem398 776 987 1,319WRB143 126 164 175 $946 1,170 1,250 1,932* Our share of capital spending.MidstreamCapital spending in our Midstream segment during the three-year period ended December 31, 2017, included:•Construction activities related to the Sweeny Fractionator and Freeport LPG Export Terminal projects. •Bakken Pipeline project, developed by our 25-percent-owned joint ventures, Dakota Access, LLC and Energy Transfer Crude Oil Company.•Construction activities related to increasing storage capacity at our crude oil and petroleum products terminal located near Beaumont, Texas.•Acquisition by Phillips 66 Partners of certain southeast Louisiana NGL logistics assets comprising approximately 500 miles of pipelines and a storage cavern connecting multiple fractionation facilities, refineries and a petrochemical facility.•Development of the Bayou Bridge Pipeline by Phillips 66 Partners’ 40-percent-owned joint venture.•Construction activities by joint ventures of Phillips 66 Partners in the Bakken production area of North Dakota, including the Palermo Rail Terminal, Sacagawea Crude Pipeline, the New Town injection point, Keene CDP Terminal and Sacagawea Gas Pipeline.•Expansion activities on the Phillips 66 Partners’ 33-percent-owned Sand Hills Pipeline including investment in the transportation of NGL from the Permian Basin to the Texas Gulf Coast. •Expansion activities on the Phillips 66 Partners’ 50-percent-owned STACK Pipeline joint venture.•Spending associated with return, reliability and maintenance projects in our Transportation and NGL and Other businesses.During the three-year period ended December 31, 2017, DCP Midstream’s capital expenditures and investments were $1.6 billion on a 100 percent basis. In 2015, we contributed $1.5 billion of cash to DCP Midstream and our co-venturer contributed its interests in certain operating assets of equal value, that are held as equity investments. Upon completion of this transaction, our interest in DCP Midstream remained at 50 percent.In 2015, REX repaid $450 million of its debt, reducing its long-term debt to approximately $2.6 billion. REX funded the repayment through member cash contributions. Our 25 percent share was approximately $112 million, which we contributed to REX in 2015.56Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsChemicalsDuring the three-year period ended December 31, 2017, CPChem had a self-funded capital program, and thus required no new capital infusions from us or our co-venturer. During this period, on a 100 percent basis, CPChem’s capital expenditures and investments were $6.2 billion. In addition, CPChem’s advances to its equity affiliates, primarily used for project construction and start-up activities, were $139 million and its repayments received from equity affiliates were $140 million.RefiningCapital spending for the Refining segment during the three-year period ended December 31, 2017, was $3.1 billion, primarily for air emission reduction and clean fuels projects to meet new environmental standards, refinery upgrade projects to increase accessibility of advantaged crudes and improve product yields, improvements to the operating integrity of key processing units, and safety-related projects.Key projects completed during the three-year period included: •Installation of a tail gas treating unit at the Humber Refinery to reduce emissions from the sulfur recovery units.•Installation of facilities to improve clean product yields at the Sweeny, Lake Charles and Ponca City refineries.•Installation of facilities to improve processing of advantaged crudes at the Billings and Ponca City refineries, as well as the jointly owned Wood River Refinery. •Installation of facilities to comply with U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Tier 3 gasoline regulations at the Alliance, Lake Charles and Sweeny refineries, as well as the jointly owned Wood River Refinery.•Installation of a crude tank to increase accessibility of waterborne crude at the Los Angeles Refinery.Major construction activities in progress include: •Installation of facilities to comply with EPA Tier 3 gasoline regulations at the Bayway and Ferndale refineries.•Installation of facilities to improve processing of advantaged crudes at the Lake Charles Refinery. •Installation of facilities to improve clean product yield at the Bayway Refinery, as well as the jointly owned Wood River Refinery.Generally, our equity affiliates in the Refining segment are intended to have self-funding capital programs. During this three-year period, on a 100 percent basis, WRB’s capital expenditures and investments were $930 million. We expect WRB’s 2018 capital program to be self-funding.Marketing and SpecialtiesCapital spending for the M&S segment during the three-year period ended December 31, 2017, was primarily for the acquisition of and investments in projects targeted at developing our new international sites. In addition, capital is used for reliability and maintenance projects at our Lubricants facilities.Corporate and OtherCapital spending for Corporate and Other during the three-year period ended December 31, 2017, was primarily for projects related to information technology and facilities.2018 BudgetOur 2018 capital budget is $2.3 billion including Phillips 66 Partners’ capital budget of $0.6 billion. This excludes our portion of planned capital spending by joint ventures DCP Midstream, CPChem and WRB totaling $0.9 billion, all of which is expected to be self-funded.The Midstream capital budget of $1.2 billion is focused on projects integrated with our existing assets and infrastructure, including continued expansion of the Beaumont Terminal, additional Gulf Coast fractionation capacity and investment in pipelines and other terminals. The Midstream capital budget also includes Phillips 66 Partners’ growth projects, including expansions of the Sand Hills and Bayou Bridge pipelines, and construction of an isomerization unit at our Lake Charles Refinery. Refining’s capital budget of $0.8 billion is primarily directed toward reliability, safety and 57Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statementsenvironmental projects, as well as small, high-return, quick payout projects, primarily to improve clean product yields. In M&S, we plan to invest approximately $0.1 billion, primarily directed towards increasing retail sites in Europe. In Corporate and Other, we plan to fund approximately $0.1 billion in projects primarily related to information technology and facilities.ContingenciesA number of lawsuits involving a variety of claims that arose in the ordinary course of business have been filed against us or are subject to indemnifications provided by us. We also may be required to remove or mitigate the effects on the environment of the placement, storage, disposal or release of certain chemical, mineral and petroleum substances at various active and inactive sites. We regularly assess the need for financial recognition or disclosure of these contingencies. In the case of all known contingencies (other than those related to income taxes), we accrue a liability when the loss is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable. If a range of amounts can be reasonably estimated and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount, then the minimum of the range is accrued. We do not reduce these liabilities for potential insurance or third-party recoveries. If applicable, we accrue receivables for probable insurance or other third-party recoveries. In the case of income-tax-related contingencies, we use a cumulative probability-weighted loss accrual in cases where sustaining a tax position is less than certain.Based on currently available information, we believe it is remote that future costs related to known contingent liability exposures will exceed current accruals by an amount that would have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements. As we learn new facts concerning contingencies, we reassess our position both with respect to accrued liabilities and other potential exposures. Estimates particularly sensitive to future changes include contingent liabilities recorded for environmental remediation, tax and legal matters. Estimated future environmental remediation costs are subject to change due to such factors as the uncertain magnitude of cleanup costs, the unknown time and extent of such remedial actions that may be required, and the determination of our liability in proportion to that of other potentially responsible parties. Estimated future costs related to tax and legal matters are subject to change as events evolve and as additional information becomes available during the administrative and litigation processes.Legal and Tax MattersOur legal and tax matters are handled by our legal and tax organizations. These organizations apply their knowledge, experience and professional judgment to the specific characteristics of our cases and uncertain tax positions. We employ a litigation management process to manage and monitor the legal proceedings against us. Our process facilitates the early evaluation and quantification of potential exposures in individual cases and enables the tracking of those cases that have been scheduled for trial and/or mediation. Based on professional judgment and experience in using these litigation management tools and available information about current developments in all our cases, our legal organization regularly assesses the adequacy of current accruals and determines if adjustment of existing accruals, or establishment of new accruals, is required. In the case of income-tax-related contingencies, we monitor tax legislation and court decisions, the status of tax audits and the statute of limitations within which a taxing authority can assert a liability. See Note 21—Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information about income-tax-related contingencies.EnvironmentalLike other companies in our industry, we are subject to numerous international, federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. Among the most significant of these international and federal environmental laws and regulations are the: •U.S. Federal Clean Air Act, which governs air emissions.•U.S. Federal Clean Water Act, which governs discharges into water bodies.•European Union Regulation for Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH), which governs the manufacture, placing on the market or use of chemicals.•U.S. Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), which imposes liability on generators, transporters and arrangers of hazardous substances at sites where hazardous substance releases have occurred or are threatening to occur.•U.S. Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), which governs the treatment, storage and disposal of solid waste.58Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements•U.S. Federal Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA), which requires facilities to report toxic chemical inventories to local emergency planning committees and response departments.•U.S. Federal Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA90), under which owners and operators of onshore facilities and pipelines as well as owners and operators of vessels are liable for removal costs and damages that result from a discharge of oil into navigable waters of the United States.•European Union Trading Directive resulting in the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS), which uses a market-based mechanism to incentivize the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.These laws and their implementing regulations set limits on emissions and, in the case of discharges to water, establish water quality limits. They also, in most cases, require permits in association with new or modified operations. These permits can require an applicant to collect substantial information in connection with the application process, which can be expensive and time consuming. In addition, there can be delays associated with notice and comment periods and the agency’s processing of the application. Many of the delays associated with the permitting process are beyond the control of the applicant.Many states and foreign countries where we operate also have, or are developing, similar environmental laws and regulations governing these same types of activities. While similar, in some cases these regulations may impose additional, or more stringent, requirements that can add to the cost and difficulty of developing infrastructure and marketing and transporting products across state and international borders. For example, in California the South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD) approved amendments to the Regional Clean Air Incentives Market (RECLAIM) that became effective in 2016, which require a phased reduction of nitrogen oxide emissions through 2022 and potentially affect refineries in the Los Angeles metropolitan area. In 2017, SCAQMD required additional nitrogen dioxide emissions reductions through 2025 and began evaluating if and how to replace the RECLAIM program with a traditional command and controls regulatory regime.The ultimate financial impact arising from environmental laws and regulations is neither clearly known nor easily determinable as new standards, such as air emission standards, water quality standards and stricter fuel regulations, continue to evolve. However, environmental laws and regulations, including those that may arise to address concerns about global climate change, are expected to continue to have an increasing impact on our operations in the United States and in other countries in which we operate. Notable areas of potential impacts include air emission compliance and remediation obligations in the United States.An example of this in the fuels area is the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA). It requires fuel producers and importers to provide additional renewable fuels for transportation motor fuels and stipulates a mix of various types to be included through 2022. We have met the increasingly stringent requirements to date while establishing implementation, operating and capital strategies, along with advanced technology development, to address projected future requirements. It is uncertain how various future requirements contained in EISA, and the regulations promulgated thereunder, may be implemented and what their full impact may be on our operations. For the 2018 compliance year, the EPA has set volumes of advanced and total renewable fuel at higher levels than mandated in most previous years (although the 2018 compliance year volumes are roughly equivalent to those required for the 2017 compliance year); it is uncertain if these increased obligations will be achievable by fuel producers and shippers without drawing on the Renewable Identification Number (RIN) bank. For compliance years after 2018, we do not know whether the EPA will utilize its authority to reduce statutory volumes. Additionally, we may experience a decrease in demand for refined petroleum products due to the regulatory program as currently promulgated. This program continues to be the subject of possible Congressional review and re-promulgation in revised form, and the EPA’s regulations pertaining to the 2014 through 2017 compliance years are subject to legal challenge, further creating uncertainty regarding renewable fuel volume requirements and obligations. Additionally, the market for RINs has been the subject of fraudulent third-party activity, and it is reasonably possible that some RINs that we have purchased may be determined to be invalid. Should that occur, we could incur costs to replace those fraudulent RINs. Although the cost for replacing any fraudulently marketed RINs is not reasonably estimable at this time, we would not expect to incur the full financial impact of fraudulent RINs replacement costs in any single interim or annual period, and would not expect such costs to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition.We also are subject to certain laws and regulations relating to environmental remediation obligations associated with current and past operations. Such laws and regulations include CERCLA and RCRA and their state equivalents. Remediation obligations include cleanup responsibility arising from petroleum releases from underground storage tanks located at numerous previously and currently owned and/or operated petroleum-marketing outlets throughout the United 59Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsStates. Federal and state laws require contamination caused by such underground storage tank releases be assessed and remediated to meet applicable standards. In addition to other cleanup standards, many states have adopted cleanup criteria for methyl tertiary-butyl ether for both soil and groundwater.At RCRA-permitted facilities, we are required to assess environmental conditions. If conditions warrant, we may be required to remediate contamination caused by prior operations. In contrast to CERCLA, which is often referred to as “Superfund,” the cost of corrective action activities under RCRA corrective action programs typically is borne solely by us. We anticipate increased expenditures for RCRA remediation activities may be required, but such annual expenditures for the near term are not expected to vary significantly from the range of such expenditures we have experienced over the past few years. Longer-term expenditures are subject to considerable uncertainty and may fluctuate significantly.We occasionally receive requests for information or notices of potential liability from the EPA and state environmental agencies alleging that we are a potentially responsible party under CERCLA or an equivalent state statute. On occasion, we also have been made a party to cost recovery litigation by those agencies or by private parties. These requests, notices and lawsuits assert potential liability for remediation costs at various sites that typically are not owned by us, but allegedly contain wastes attributable to our past operations. As of December 31, 2016, we reported that we had been notified of potential liability under CERCLA and comparable state laws at 31 sites within the United States. During 2017, there were three new sites for which we received notification of potential liability, and three sites were deemed resolved and closed, leaving 31 unresolved sites with potential liability at December 31, 2017. For most Superfund sites, our potential liability will be significantly less than the total site remediation costs because the percentage of waste attributable to us, versus that attributable to all other potentially responsible parties, is relatively low. Although liability of those potentially responsible is generally joint and several for federal sites and frequently so for state sites, other potentially responsible parties at sites where we are a party typically have had the financial strength to meet their obligations, and where they have not, or where potentially responsible parties could not be located, our share of liability has not increased materially. Many of the sites for which we are potentially responsible are still under investigation by the EPA or the state agencies concerned. Prior to actual cleanup, those potentially responsible normally assess site conditions, apportion responsibility and determine the appropriate remediation. In some instances, we may have no liability or attain a settlement of liability. Actual cleanup costs generally occur after the parties obtain EPA or equivalent state agency approval of a remediation plan. There are relatively few sites where we are a major participant, and given the timing and amounts of anticipated expenditures, neither the cost of remediation at those sites nor such costs at all CERCLA sites, in the aggregate, is expected to have a material adverse effect on our competitive or financial condition.Expensed environmental costs were $690 million in 2017 and are expected to be approximately $670 million and $640 million in 2018 and 2019, respectively. Capitalized environmental costs were $159 million in 2017 and are expected to be approximately $185 million and $135 million, in 2018 and 2019, respectively. This amount does not include capital expenditures made for another purpose that have an indirect benefit on environmental compliance.Accrued liabilities for remediation activities are not reduced for potential recoveries from insurers or other third parties and are not discounted (except those assumed in a business combination, which we record on a discounted basis).Many of these liabilities result from CERCLA, RCRA and similar state laws that require us to undertake certain investigative and remedial activities at sites where we conduct, or once conducted, operations or at sites where our generated waste was disposed. We also have accrued for a number of sites we identified that may require environmental remediation, but which are not currently the subject of CERCLA, RCRA or state enforcement activities. If applicable, we accrue receivables for probable insurance or other third-party recoveries. In the future, we may incur significant costs under both CERCLA and RCRA. Remediation activities vary substantially in duration and cost from site to site, depending on the mix of unique site characteristics, evolving remediation technologies, diverse regulatory agencies and enforcement policies, and the presence or absence of potentially liable third parties. Therefore, it is difficult to develop reasonable estimates of future site remediation costs.Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, and as with other companies engaged in similar businesses, environmental costs and liabilities are inherent concerns in certain of our operations and products, and there can be no assurance that material costs and liabilities will not be incurred. However, we currently do not expect any material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position as a result of compliance with current environmental laws and regulations.60Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsClimate ChangeThere has been a broad range of proposed or promulgated state, national and international laws focusing on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction, including various regulations proposed or issued by the EPA. These proposed or promulgated laws apply or could apply in states and/or countries where we have interests or may have interests in the future. Laws regulating GHG emissions continue to evolve, and while it is not possible to accurately estimate either a timetable for implementation or our future compliance costs relating to implementation, such laws potentially could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition as a result of increasing costs of compliance, lengthening project implementation and agency review items, or reducing demand for certain hydrocarbon products. Examples of legislation or precursors for possible regulation that do or could affect our operations include: •EU ETS, which is part of the European Union’s policy to combat climate change and is a key tool for reducing industrial greenhouse gas emissions. EU ETS impacts factories, power stations and other installations across all EU member states. •California’s Global Warming Solutions Act, which requires the California Air Resources Board to develop regulations and market mechanisms that will target reduction of California’s GHG emissions by 25 percent by 2020 (as well as SB32, which requires further reduction of California's GHG emissions to 40 percent below the 1990 emission level by 2030, and the recently-enacted AB398, which extends the California GHG emission cap-and-trade program through 2030). Other GHG emissions programs in the western U.S. states have been enacted or are under consideration or development, including amendments to California's Low Carbon Fuel Standard, Oregon's Low Carbon Fuel Standard, and Washington's carbon reduction programs.•The U.S. Supreme Court decision in Massachusetts v. EPA, 549 U.S. 497, 127 S. Ct. 1438 (2007), confirming that the EPA has the authority to regulate carbon dioxide as an “air pollutant” under the Federal Clean Air Act.•The EPA’s announcement on March 29, 2010 (published as “Interpretation of Regulations that Determine Pollutants Covered by Clean Air Act Permitting Programs,” 75 Fed. Reg. 17004 (April 2, 2010)), and the EPA’s and U.S. Department of Transportation’s joint promulgation of a Final Rule on April 1, 2010, that triggers regulation of GHGs under the Clean Air Act. These collectively may lead to more climate-based claims for damages, and may result in longer agency review time for development projects to determine the extent of potential climate change. •EPA's 2015 Final Rule regulating GHG emissions from existing fossil fuel-fired electrical generating units under the Federal Clean Air Act, commonly referred to as the Clean Power Plan.•Carbon taxes in certain jurisdictions.•GHG emission cap and trade programs in certain jurisdictions.In the EU, the first phase of the EU ETS completed at the end of 2007 and Phase II was undertaken from 2008 through to 2012. The current phase (Phase III) runs from 2013 through to 2020, with the main changes being reduced allocation of free allowances and increased auctioning of new allowances. Phillips 66 has assets that are subject to the EU ETS, and the company is actively engaged in minimizing any financial impact from the EU ETS.From November 30 to December 12, 2015, more than 190 countries, including the United States, participated in the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris, France. The conference culminated in what is known as the “Paris Agreement,” which, upon certain conditions being met, entered into force on November 4, 2016. The Paris Agreement establishes a commitment by signatory parties to pursue domestic GHG emission reductions. In 2017, the President of the United States announced his intention to withdraw the United States from the Paris Agreement. In the United States, some additional form of regulation is likely to be forthcoming in the future at the state or federal levels with respect to GHG emissions. Such regulation could take any of several forms that may result in the creation of additional costs in the form of taxes, the restriction of output, investments of capital to maintain compliance with laws and regulations, or required acquisition or trading of emission allowances. We are working to continuously improve operational and energy efficiency through resource and energy conservation throughout our operations.Compliance with changes in laws and regulations that create a GHG emission trading program, GHG reduction requirements or carbon taxes could significantly increase our costs, reduce demand for fossil energy derived products, impact the cost and availability of capital and increase our exposure to litigation. Such laws and regulations could also increase demand for less carbon intensive energy sources. 61Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsAn example of one such program is California’s cap and trade program, which was promulgated pursuant to the State’s Global Warming Solutions Act. The program had been limited to certain stationary sources, which include our refineries in California, but beginning in January 2015 expanded to include emissions from transportation fuels distributed in California. Inclusion of transportation fuels in California’s cap and trade program as currently promulgated has increased our cap and trade program compliance costs. The ultimate impact on our financial performance, either positive or negative, from this and similar programs, will depend on a number of factors, including, but not limited to: •Whether and to what extent legislation or regulation is enacted.•The nature of the legislation or regulation (such as a cap and trade system or a tax on emissions).•The GHG reductions required.•The price and availability of offsets.•The demand for, and amount and allocation of allowances.•Technological and scientific developments leading to new products or services.•Any potential significant physical effects of climate change (such as increased severe weather events, changes in sea levels and changes in temperature).•Whether, and the extent to which, increased compliance costs are ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services.We consider and take into account anticipated future GHG emissions in designing and developing major facilities and projects, and implement energy efficiency initiatives to reduce GHG emissions. Data on our GHG emissions, legal requirements regulating such emissions, and the possible physical effects of climate change on our coastal assets are incorporated into our planning, investment, and risk management decision-making.62Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATESThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to select appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. See Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for descriptions of our major accounting policies. Certain of these accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent that there is a reasonable likelihood that materially different amounts would have been reported under different conditions, or if different assumptions had been used. The following discussion of critical accounting estimates, along with the discussion of contingencies in this report, address all important accounting areas where the nature of accounting estimates or assumptions could be material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change.ImpairmentsLong-lived assets used in operations are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate a possible significant deterioration in future cash flows is expected. If the sum of the undiscounted pre-tax cash flows of an asset group is less than the carrying value, including applicable liabilities, the carrying value is written down to estimated fair value. Individual assets are grouped for impairment purposes based on a judgmental assessment of the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets (for example, at a refinery complex level). Because there usually is a lack of quoted market prices for long-lived assets, the fair value of impaired assets is typically determined using one or more of the following methods: the present value of expected future cash flows using discount rates and other assumptions believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants; a market multiple of earnings for similar assets; or historical market transactions of similar assets, adjusted using principal market participant assumptions when necessary. The expected future cash flows used for impairment reviews and related fair value calculations are based on judgmental assessments of future volumes, commodity prices, operating costs, margins, discount rates and capital project decisions, considering all available information at the date of review.Investments in nonconsolidated entities accounted for under the equity method are assessed for impairment when there are indicators of a loss in value, such as a lack of sustained earnings capacity or a current fair value less than the investment’s carrying amount. When it is determined that an indicated impairment is other than temporary, a charge is recognized for the difference between the investment’s carrying value and its estimated fair value. When determining whether a decline in value is other than temporary, management considers factors such as the length of time and extent of the decline, the investee’s financial condition and near-term prospects, and our ability and intention to retain our investment for a period that allows for recovery. When quoted market prices are not available, the fair value is usually based on the present value of expected future cash flows using discount rates and other assumptions believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants and a market analysis of comparable assets, if appropriate. Differing assumptions could affect the timing and the amount of an impairment of an investment in any period.Asset Retirement ObligationsUnder various contracts, permits and regulations, we have legal obligations to remove tangible equipment and restore the land at the end of operations at certain operational sites. Our largest asset removal obligations involve asbestos abatement at refineries. Estimating the timing and amount of payments for future asset removal costs is difficult. Most of these removal obligations are many years, or decades, in the future, and the contracts and regulations often have vague descriptions of what removal practices and criteria must be met when the removal event actually occurs. Asset removal technologies and costs, regulatory and other compliance considerations, expenditure timing, and other inputs into valuation of the obligation, including discount and inflation rates, are also subject to change.Environmental CostsIn addition to asset retirement obligations discussed above, we have certain obligations to complete environmental-related projects. These projects are primarily related to cleanup at domestic refineries, underground storage sites and non-operated sites. Future environmental remediation costs are difficult to estimate because they are subject to change due to such factors as the uncertain magnitude of cleanup costs, timing and extent of such remedial actions that may be required, and the determination of our liability in proportion to that of other responsible parties.63Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsIntangible Assets and GoodwillAt December 31, 2017, we had $756 million of intangible assets that we have determined to have indefinite useful lives, and therefore are not amortized. This judgmental assessment of an indefinite useful life must be continuously evaluated in the future. If, due to changes in facts and circumstances, management determines these intangible assets have finite useful lives, amortization will commence at that time on a prospective basis. As long as these intangible assets are judged to have indefinite lives, they will be subject to annual impairment tests that require management’s judgment of the estimated fair value of these intangible assets.At December 31, 2017, we had $3.3 billion of goodwill recorded in conjunction with past business combinations. Goodwill is not amortized. Instead, goodwill is subject to at least annual reviews for impairment at a reporting unit level. The reporting units used to evaluate and measure goodwill for impairment are determined primarily from the manner in which the business is managed. A reporting unit is an operating segment or a component that is one level below an operating segment.Because quoted market prices for our reporting units are not available, management applies judgment in determining the estimated fair values of the reporting units for purposes of performing the goodwill impairment test. Management uses all available information to make this fair value determination, including observed market earnings multiples of comparable companies, our common stock price and associated total company market capitalization. Sales or dispositions of significant assets within a reporting unit are allocated a portion of that reporting unit’s goodwill, based on relative fair values, which impacts the amount of gain or loss on the sale or disposition.We completed our annual impairment test as of October 1, 2017, and concluded that the fair value of each of our reporting units continued to exceed their respective recorded net book values by a significant percentage. A decline in the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting units in the future could result in an impairment. For example, a prolonged or significant decline in our stock price or a significant decline in actual or forecasted earnings could provide evidence of a significant decline in fair value and a need to record a material impairment of goodwill for one or more of our reporting units. After we have completed our annual test, we continue to monitor for impairment indicators, which can lead to further goodwill impairment testing.Tax Assets and LiabilitiesOur operations are subject to various taxes, including federal, state and foreign income taxes, property taxes, and transactional taxes such as excise, sales/use and payroll taxes. We record tax liabilities based on our assessment of existing tax laws and regulations. The recording of tax liabilities requires significant judgment and estimates. We recognize the financial statement effects of an income tax position when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination by a taxing authority. A contingent liability related to a transactional tax claim is recorded if the loss is both probable and estimable. Actual incurred tax liabilities can vary from our estimates for a variety of reasons, including different interpretations of tax laws and regulations and different assessments of the amount of tax due.In determining our income tax expense (benefit), we assess the likelihood our deferred tax assets will be recovered through future taxable income. Valuation allowances reduce deferred tax assets to an amount that will, more likely than not, be realized. Judgment is required in estimating the amount of valuation allowance, if any, that should be recorded against our deferred tax assets. Based on our historical taxable income, our expectations for the future, and available tax-planning strategies, we expect the net deferred tax assets will more likely than not be realized as offsets to reversing deferred tax liabilities and as reductions to future taxable income. If our actual results of operations differ from such estimates or our estimates of future taxable income change, the valuation allowance may need to be revised.New tax laws and regulations, as well as changes to existing tax laws and regulations, are continuously being proposed or promulgated. The implementation of future legislative and regulatory tax initiatives could result in increased income tax liabilities that cannot be predicted at this time. The material provisions of the Tax Act i) reduced the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent beginning January 1, 2018, ii) imposed a one-time deemed repatriation tax on foreign-sourced earnings that were previously tax deferred, and iii) created a new tax regime on post-2017 foreign-sourced earnings. We have not yet completed our accounting for the income tax effects of the Tax Act as of December 31, 2017, but have made reasonable estimates of those effects on our existing deferred income tax balances and the one-time deemed repatriation tax. As more guidelines and interpretations of the Tax Act become available over the next year, the estimates previously made may change, which could increase or decrease our revalued deferred income tax balances and the one-time deemed repatriation tax, with an offset to earnings.64Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsProjected Benefit Obligations Determination of the projected benefit obligations for our defined benefit pension and postretirement plans impacts the obligations on the balance sheet and the amount of benefit expense in the income statement. The actuarial determination of projected benefit obligations and company contribution requirements involves judgment about uncertain future events, including estimated retirement dates, salary levels at retirement, mortality rates, lump-sum election rates, rates of return on plan assets, future interest rates, future health care cost-trend rates, and rates of utilization of health care services by retirees. Due to the specialized nature of these calculations, we engage outside actuarial firms to assist in the determination of these projected benefit obligations and company contribution requirements. Due to differing objectives and requirements between financial accounting rules and the pension plan funding regulations promulgated by governmental agencies, the actuarial methods and assumptions for the two purposes differ in certain important respects. Ultimately, we will be required to fund all promised benefits under pension and postretirement benefit plans not funded by plan assets or investment returns, but the judgmental assumptions used in the actuarial calculations significantly affect periodic financial statements and funding patterns over time. Benefit expense is particularly sensitive to the discount rate and return on plan assets assumptions. A one percentage-point decrease in the discount rate assumption would increase annual benefit expense by an estimated $65 million, while a one percentage-point decrease in the return on plan assets assumption would increase annual benefit expense by an estimated $35 million. In determining the discount rate, we use yields on high-quality fixed income investments with payments matched to the estimated distributions of benefits from our plans.In 2017 and 2016, our expected weighted-average long-term rate of return was approximately 6 percent for our worldwide pension plan assets. The actual weighted-average rate of return was 15 percent and 10 percent in 2017 and 2016, respectively. For the past ten years, our weighted-average actual rate of return was 7 percent for worldwide pension plan assets.NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDSIn February 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2017-05, “Other Income—Gains and Losses from the Derecognition of Nonfinancial Assets (Subtopic 610-20).” This ASU clarifies the scope and accounting for the sale or transfer of nonfinancial assets and in substance nonfinancial assets to noncustomers, including partial sales. This ASU will eliminate the use of carryover basis for most nonmonetary exchanges, including contributions of assets to equity method joint ventures. These amendments could result in the entity recognizing a gain or loss on the sale or transfer of nonfinancial assets. Public entities should apply the guidance in ASU No. 2017-05 to annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those periods. There was no impact on our financial statements from adopting this ASU on January 1, 2018.In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-01, “Business Combinations (Topic 805): Clarifying the Definition of a Business,” which clarifies the definition of a business with the objective of adding guidance to assist in evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions of assets or businesses. The amendment provides a screen for determining when a transaction involves an acquisition of a business. If substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset, or a group of similar identifiable assets, then the transaction is not considered an acquisition of a business. If the screen is not met, then the amendment requires that to be considered a business, the operation must include at a minimum an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create an output. The guidance may reduce the number of transactions accounted for as business acquisitions. Public business entities should apply the guidance in ASU No. 2017-01 to annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those periods, with early adoption permitted. The amendments should be applied prospectively and no disclosures are required at the effective date. There was no impact on our financial statements from adopting this ASU on January 1, 2018.In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, “Financial Instruments—Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.” The new standard amends the impairment model to utilize an expected loss methodology in place of the currently used incurred loss methodology, which may result in earlier recognition of losses. Public business entities should apply the guidance in ASU No. 2016-13 for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption will be permitted for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018. We are currently evaluating the provisions of ASU No. 2016-13 and assessing the impact on our financial statements.65Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842).” The new standard establishes a right-of-use (ROU) model that requires a lessee to record a ROU asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months. Leases will continue to be classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement. Similarly, lessors will be required to classify leases as sales-type, finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of income recognition. Classification for both lessees and lessors will be based on an assessment of whether risks and rewards as well as substantive control have been transferred through a lease contract. Public business entities should apply the guidance in ASU No. 2016-02 for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted. Entities are required to adopt the ASU using a modified retrospective approach, subject to certain optional practical expedients, and apply the provisions of ASU No. 2016-02 to leasing arrangements existing at or entered into after the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements. We are currently evaluating the provisions of ASU No. 2016-02 and assessing its impact on our financial statements. As part of our assessment to-date, we have formed an implementation team, commenced identification of our lease population and selected a lease software package. We expect the adoption of ASU 2016-02 will materially gross up our consolidated balance sheet with the recognition of the ROU assets and operating lease liabilities. The impact to our consolidated statements of income and cash flows is not expected to be material. The new standard will also require additional disclosures for financing and operating leases.In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01, “Financial Instruments—Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities,” to meet its objective of providing more decision-useful information about financial instruments. The majority of this ASU’s provisions amend only the presentation or disclosures of financial instruments; however, one provision will also affect net income. Equity investments carried under the cost method or lower of cost or fair value method of accounting, in accordance with current GAAP, will have to be carried at fair value upon adoption of ASU No. 2016-01, with changes in fair value recorded in net income. For equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values, a company may elect to carry such investments at cost less impairments, if any, adjusted up or down for price changes in similar financial instruments issued by the investee, when and if observed. Public business entities should apply the guidance in ASU No. 2016-01 for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those annual periods, with early adoption prohibited. We are currently evaluating the provisions of ASU No. 2016-01. Our initial review indicates that ASU No. 2016-01 will have a limited impact on our financial statements.In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606).” This ASU and other related updates are intended to improve comparability of revenue recognition practices across entities, industries, jurisdictions and capital markets and expand disclosure requirements. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date.” The amendment in this ASU defers the effective date of ASU No. 2014-09 for all entities for one year. Public business entities should apply the guidance in ASU No. 2014-09 to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. Our assessment work primarily included the formation of an implementation work team, training on the new ASU’s revenue recognition model, contract review and documentation and the monitoring of industry interpretative issues. We adopted the standard on January 1, 2018, using the modified retrospective application. Our evaluation of the new ASU is near completion, which includes understanding the impact of adoption on earnings from equity method investments. Based upon our analysis to-date, the primary impact of adoption of the new standard is the netting of sales-based taxes collected from our customers against revenue. Sales-based taxes include excise taxes on sales of petroleum products as noted on our consolidated statement of income. We have not identified any other material impact on our financial statements other than disclosures.66Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsItem 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKFinancial Instrument Market RiskWe and certain of our subsidiaries hold and issue derivative contracts and financial instruments that expose our cash flows or earnings to changes in commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates. We may use financial- and commodity-based derivative contracts to manage the risks produced by changes in the prices of crude oil and related products, natural gas, NGL, and electric power; fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates; or to capture market opportunities.Our use of derivative instruments is governed by an “Authority Limitations” document approved by our Board of Directors, that prohibits the use of highly leveraged derivatives or derivative instruments without sufficient market liquidity for comparable valuations. The Authority Limitations document also establishes Value at Risk (VaR) limits, and compliance with these limits is monitored daily. Our Chief Financial Officer monitors risks resulting from foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. Our Executive Vice President, Marketing and Commercial monitors commodity price risk. The Commercial organization manages our commercial marketing, optimizes our commodity flows and positions, and monitors related risks of our businesses.Commodity Price RiskWe sell into or receive supply from the worldwide crude oil, refined products, natural gas, NGL, and electric power markets, exposing our revenues, purchases, cost of operating activities, and cash flows to fluctuations in the prices for these commodities. Generally, our policy is to remain exposed to the market prices of commodities. Consistent with this policy, our Commercial organization uses derivative contracts to effectively convert our exposure from fixed-price sales contracts, often requested by refined product customers, back to fluctuating market prices. Conversely, our Commercial organization also uses futures, forwards, swaps and options in various markets to accomplish the following objectives to optimize the value of our supply chain, and this may reduce our exposure to fluctuations in market prices:•In addition to cash settlement prior to contract expiration, exchange-traded futures contracts may be settled by physical delivery of the commodity. This provides another source of supply to balance physical systems or to meet our refinery requirements and marketing demand.•Manage the risk to our cash flows from price exposures on specific crude oil, refined product, natural gas, NGL, and electric power transactions.•Enable us to use the market knowledge gained from these activities to capture market opportunities such as moving physical commodities to more profitable locations, storing commodities to capture seasonal or time premiums, and blending commodities to capture quality upgrades. Derivatives may be utilized to optimize these activities.We use a VaR model to estimate the loss in fair value that could potentially result on a single day from the effect of adverse changes in market conditions on the derivative financial instruments and derivative commodity instruments held or issued, including commodity purchase and sales contracts recorded on the balance sheet at December 31, 2017, as derivative instruments. Using the Monte Carlo simulation, a 95 percent confidence level and a one-day holding period, the VaR for those instruments issued or held for trading purposes at December 31, 2017 and 2016, was immaterial to our cash flows and net income. The VaR for instruments held for purposes other than trading at December 31, 2017 and 2016, was also immaterial to our cash flows and net income.67Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsInterest Rate RiskOur use of fixed- or variable-rate debt directly exposes us to interest rate risk. Fixed-rate debt, such as our senior notes, exposes us to changes in the fair value of our debt due to changes in market interest rates. Fixed-rate debt also exposes us to the risk that we may need to refinance maturing debt with new debt at higher rates, or that we may be obligated to pay rates higher than the current market. Variable-rate debt, such as our floating-rate notes or borrowings under our revolving credit facility, exposes us to short-term changes in market rates that impact our interest expense. The following tables provide information about our debt instruments that are sensitive to changes in U.S. interest rates. These tables present principal cash flows and related weighted-average interest rates by expected maturity dates. Weighted-average variable rates are based on effective rates at the reporting date. The carrying amount of our floating-rate debt approximates its fair value. The fair value of the fixed-rate financial instruments is estimated based on observable market prices.

1534701,PSX,Phillips 66,2019,"Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSUnless otherwise indicated, “the company,” “we,” “our,” “us” and “Phillips 66” are used in this report to refer to the businesses of Phillips 66 and its consolidated subsidiaries.Management’s Discussion and Analysis is the company’s analysis of its financial performance, financial condition, and significant trends that may affect future performance. It should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. It contains forward-looking statements including, without limitation, statements relating to the company’s plans, strategies, objectives, expectations and intentions that are made pursuant to the “safe harbor” provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The words “anticipate,” “estimate,” “believe,” “budget,” “continue,” “could,” “intend,” “may,” “plan,” “potential,” “predict,” “seek,” “should,” “will,” “would,” “expect,” “objective,” “projection,” “forecast,” “goal,” “guidance,” “outlook,” “effort,” “target” and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements. The company does not undertake to update, revise or correct any of the forward-looking information unless required to do so under the federal securities laws. Readers are cautioned that such forward-looking statements should be read in conjunction with the company’s disclosures under the heading: “CAUTIONARY STATEMENT FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE ‘SAFE HARBOR’ PROVISIONS OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995.” The terms “earnings” and “loss” as used in Management’s Discussion and Analysis refer to net income (loss) attributable to Phillips 66. The terms “pre-tax income” or “pre-tax loss” as used in Management’s Discussion and Analysis refer to income (loss) before income taxes. EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW AND BUSINESS ENVIRONMENTPhillips 66 is an energy manufacturing and logistics company with midstream, chemicals, refining, and marketing and specialties businesses. At December 31, 2018, we had total assets of $54.3 billion.Executive OverviewIn 2018, we reported earnings of $5.6 billion, generated $7.6 billion in cash from operating activities and raised net proceeds of $1.5 billion from the issuance of senior notes. We used available cash primarily for repurchases of our common stock of $4.6 billion, capital expenditures and investments of $2.6 billion, dividend payments on our common stock of $1.4 billion and the early repayment of $550 million of debt. We ended 2018 with $3.0 billion of cash and cash equivalents and approximately $5.6 billion of total committed capacity available under our credit facilities.We continue to focus on the following strategic priorities:•Operating Excellence. Our commitment to operating excellence guides everything we do. We are committed to protecting the health and safety of everyone who has a role in our operations and the communities in which we operate. Continuous improvement in safety, environmental stewardship, reliability and cost efficiency is a fundamental requirement for our company and employees. We employ rigorous training and audit programs to drive ongoing improvement in both personal and process safety as we strive for zero incidents. Since we cannot control commodity prices, controlling operating expenses and overhead costs, within the context of our commitment to safety and environmental stewardship, is a high priority. Senior management actively monitors these costs. We are committed to protecting the environment and strive to reduce our environmental footprint throughout our operations. Optimizing utilization rates at our refineries through reliable and safe operations enables us to capture the value available in the market in terms of prices and margins. During 2018, our worldwide refining crude oil capacity utilization rate was 95 percent. 32Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements•Growth. We have budgeted $3.2 billion in capital expenditures and investments in 2019, including $0.9 billion for Phillips 66 Partners LP (Phillips 66 Partners). The Phillips 66 Partners’ capital budget includes $0.3 billion of capital expected to be cash funded by noncontrolling interests. Additionally, our share of expected self-funded capital spending by joint ventures DCP Midstream, LLC (DCP Midstream), Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC (CPChem) and WRB Refining LP (WRB) in 2019 is $1.2 billion. In Midstream, we will continue building out our integrated logistics infrastructure network, including pipelines, storage, export and fractionation facilities. In Chemicals, CPChem’s growth capital will fund continuing development of a second U.S. Gulf Coast petrochemicals project and debottlenecking opportunities on existing assets. Growth capital in Refining will be directed toward high-return projects to enhance the yield of higher-value products, as well as other low-capital, quick-payout projects, while in Marketing and Specialties (M&S) it will be to further grow and enhance retail sites in Europe.•Returns. We plan to improve refining returns by increasing throughput of advantaged feedstocks, disciplined capital allocation and portfolio optimization. A disciplined capital allocation process ensures we focus investments in projects that generate competitive returns throughout the business cycle. In 2018, our Midstream segment benefited from higher equity earnings and cash distributions from our investments in joint venture pipelines. Our Refining segment maintained a strong clean product yield and a high advantaged crude oil throughput rate at our U.S. refineries. Additionally, our M&S segment continued to enhance our network and brand by re-imaging sites in the United States. •Distributions. We believe shareholder value is enhanced through, among other things, consistent growth of regular dividends, complemented by share repurchases. We increased our quarterly dividend rate by 14 percent during 2018, and have increased it every year since the company’s inception in 2012. Regular dividends demonstrate the confidence our Board of Directors and management have in our capital structure and operations’ capability to generate free cash flow throughout the business cycle. In 2018, we repurchased $4.6 billion, or approximately 48 million shares, of our common stock. At the discretion of our Board of Directors, we plan to increase dividends annually and fund our share repurchase program while continuing to invest in the growth of our business. •High-Performing Organization. We strive to attract, develop and retain individuals with the knowledge and skills to implement our business strategy and who support our values and culture. Throughout the company, we focus on getting results in the right way and believe success is both what we do and how we do it. We encourage collaboration throughout our company, while valuing differences, respecting diversity, and creating a great place to work. We foster an environment of learning and development through structured programs focused on enhancing functional and technical skills where employees are engaged in our business and committed to their own, as well as the company’s, success.33Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsBusiness EnvironmentThe price of U.S. benchmark crude oil, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) at Cushing, Oklahoma, increased to an average of $64.92 per barrel during 2018, compared with an average of $50.90 per barrel in 2017. The WTI discount versus the international benchmark Dated Brent widened in 2018, compared with 2017, due to growing U.S. crude production. A widening differential generally benefits our results. Over the course of 2018, commodity prices had both favorable and unfavorable impacts on our businesses that vary by segment. The Midstream segment, which includes our 50 percent equity investment in DCP Midstream, contains fee-based operations that are not directly exposed to commodity price risk, as well as operations that are directly linked to natural gas liquids (NGL) prices, natural gas prices and crude oil prices. Natural gas prices were relatively flat in 2018, compared with 2017, while NGL prices were higher in 2018 due to higher global crude oil prices and increased domestic demand for ethane. The Chemicals segment consists of our 50 percent equity investment in CPChem. The chemicals and plastics industry is mainly a commodity-based industry where the margins for key products are based on supply and demand, as well as cost factors. During 2018, the high-density polyethylene chain margin contracted mainly due to rapidly expanding North American supply. In addition, lower naptha-based feedstock costs internationally narrowed the difference between naptha-based and ethane-based margins. However, North American ethane-based crackers integrated through ethylene derivatives continue to benefit from a feedstock price advantage associated with abundant domestic supply and continue to capture a higher polyethylene chain margin than crackers in most other regions of the world.Our Refining segment results are driven by several factors, including refining margins, cost control, refinery throughput, feedstock costs, product yields and turnaround activity. Industry crack spread indicators, the difference between market prices for refined petroleum products and crude oil, are used to estimate refining margins. During 2018, the U.S. 3:2:1 crack spread (three barrels of crude oil producing two barrels of gasoline and one barrel of diesel) decreased compared with 2017, primarily due to lower gasoline crack spreads caused by higher refinery utilization. The average Northwest Europe crack spread increased slightly in 2018, compared with 2017, due to higher distillate prices.Results for our M&S segment depend largely on marketing fuel margins, lubricant margins, and other specialty product margins. While M&S margins are primarily driven by market factors, largely determined by the relationship between supply and demand, marketing fuel margins, in particular, are influenced by the trend in spot prices for refined petroleum products. Generally speaking, a downward trend of spot prices has a favorable impact on marketing fuel margins, while an upward trend of spot prices has an unfavorable impact on marketing fuel margins.34Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsRESULTS OF OPERATIONSBasis of PresentationDuring the fourth quarter of 2018, the segment performance measure used by our chief executive officer to assess performance and allocate resources was changed from “net income” to “income before income taxes.” Prior-period segment information has been recast to conform to the current presentation.Consolidated ResultsA summary of income (loss) before income taxes by business segment with a reconciliation to net income attributable to Phillips 66 follows: Millions of Dollars Year Ended December 31 2018 2017 2016 Midstream$1,181 638 403Chemicals1,025 716 839Refining4,535 2,076 435Marketing and Specialties1,557 1,020 1,261Corporate and Other(853) (895) (747)Income before income taxes7,445 3,555 2,191Income tax expense (benefit)1,572 (1,693) 547Net income5,873 5,248 1,644Less: net income attributable to noncontrolling interests278 142 89Net income attributable to Phillips 66$5,595 5,106 1,5552018 vs. 2017 Our earnings increased $489 million, or 10 percent, in 2018, mainly reflecting: •Higher realized refining and marketing margins.•Higher earnings from equity affiliates in our Midstream and Chemicals segments.•A lower U.S. federal corporate income tax rate beginning January 1, 2018, as a result of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act) enacted in December 2017.These increases were partially offset by:•A $2,735 million provisional income tax benefit from the enactment of the Tax Act recognized in December 2017, primarily due to the revaluation of deferred income taxes.•A $261 million noncash, after-tax gain from the consolidation of Merey Sweeny, L.P., predecessor to Merey Sweeny LLC (both referred to herein as Merey Sweeny), in 2017.•Higher net income attributable to noncontrolling interests primarily due to the contribution of assets to Phillips 66 Partners in the fourth quarter of 2017.•Higher interest and debt expense.35Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements2017 vs. 2016 Our earnings increased $3,551 million, or 228 percent, in 2017, primarily resulting from: •Recognition of the $2,735 million provisional income tax benefit from the enactment of the Tax Act in December 2017.•Higher realized refining margins.•Recognition of the $261 million after-tax gain from the consolidation of Merey Sweeny.•Improved equity earnings from affiliates in our Midstream segment.These increases were partially offset by:•Increased costs due to Hurricane Harvey, primarily impacting CPChem in our Chemicals segment. •Lower realized marketing margins.•Higher interest and debt expense.See the “Segment Results” section for additional information on our segment results.36Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsIncome Statement Analysis2018 vs. 2017 Sales and other operating revenues and purchased crude oil and products increased 9 percent and 23 percent, respectively, in 2018. The increases were mainly due to higher prices for refined petroleum products, crude oil and NGL. The increase in sales and other operating revenues was partially offset by a change in the presentation of excise taxes on sales of refined petroleum products resulting from our adoption of Financial Accounting Standard Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606),” on January 1, 2018. As part of our adoption of this ASU, prospectively from January 1, 2018, our presentation of excise taxes on sales of refined petroleum products changed to a net basis from a gross basis. As a result, the “Sales and other operating revenues” and “Taxes other than income taxes” lines on our consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2018, are not presented on a comparable basis to the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. See Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 2—Changes in Accounting Principles, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for further information on our presentation of excise taxes on sales of refined petroleum products and our adoption of this ASU, respectively. Equity in earnings of affiliates increased 55 percent in 2018, primarily resulting from higher equity in earnings from WRB, CPChem and affiliates in our Midstream segment. •Equity in earnings of WRB increased $483 million, primarily due to higher realized margins driven by improved feedstock advantage. •Equity in earnings of CPChem increased $312 million, primarily due to commencement of full operations at CPChem’s new U.S. Gulf Coast petrochemicals assets and lower hurricane-related costs and downtime in 2018.•Equity in earnings for our Midstream segment increased $222 million, primarily due to higher volumes on affiliate pipelines, including the Bakken Pipeline, which operated for a full year in 2018.Other income decreased $460 million in 2018. We recognized a noncash, pre-tax gain of $423 million in February 2017 related to the consolidation of Merey Sweeny. See Note 5—Business Combinations, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. Taxes other than income taxes decreased 97 percent in 2018. The decrease was primarily attributable to the change in our presentation of excise taxes on sales of refined petroleum products resulting from our adoption of ASU No. 2014-09 on January 1, 2018. See the “Sales and other operating revenues” section above for further discussion.Interest and debt expense increased 15 percent in 2018. The increase was due to higher average debt principal balances resulting from our issuance of senior notes totaling $1,500 million in March 2018 and Phillips 66 Partners’ issuance of senior notes totaling $650 million in October 2017.Income tax expense (benefit) was an expense in 2018, compared with a benefit in 2017. The benefit in 2017 was due to the recognition of a provisional income tax benefit of $2,735 million from the enactment of the Tax Act in December 2017. The benefit from the Tax Act was primarily due to the revaluation of deferred income taxes. Excluding this benefit, income tax expense increased in 2018 due to higher income before income taxes, partially offset by the reduction of the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent beginning January 1, 2018, as a result of the Tax Act. See Note 21—Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for more information regarding our income taxes.Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests increased $136 million in 2018, primarily due to the contribution of assets to Phillips 66 Partners in the fourth quarter of 2017. See Note 27—Phillips 66 Partners LP, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for more information.37Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements2017 vs. 2016 Sales and other operating revenues and purchased crude oil and products increased 21 percent and 27 percent, respectively, in 2017. The increases were primarily due to higher prices for refined petroleum products, crude oil and NGL. Equity in earnings of affiliates increased 22 percent in 2017, primarily resulting from higher equity in earnings from DCP Midstream and other affiliates in our Midstream segment, as well as WRB, partially offset by lower results from CPChem.•Equity in earnings from our Midstream segment increased $270 million due to improved results from DCP Midstream, primarily driven by improved margins, as well as higher equity in earnings from our pipeline affiliates, including our joint ventures that own the Bakken Pipeline, which started commercial operations in June 2017.•Equity in earnings of WRB increased $207 million, primarily due to higher market crack spreads, partially offset by lower feedstock advantage.•Equity in earnings of CPChem decreased $120 million, primarily due to hurricane-related costs and downtime.Other income increased $447 million in 2017. We recognized a noncash, pre-tax gain of $423 million in February 2017 related to the consolidation of Merey Sweeny. See Note 5—Business Combinations, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. Operating expenses increased 10 percent in 2017. This increase was mainly due to the consolidation of a transportation joint venture in December 2016, as well as higher refining turnaround expenses and utility costs, pension settlement expense, and costs associated with a full year of operations at the Freeport LPG Export Terminal. These increases were partially offset by lower costs due to the sale of the Whitegate Refinery in 2016. Depreciation and amortization increased 13 percent in 2017 due to the Freeport LPG Export Terminal beginning operations in late 2016, as well as other assets placed in service in 2017.Interest and debt expense increased 30 percent in 2017. This increase was primarily driven by lower capitalized interest due to the completion of major projects, including completion of the Freeport LPG Export Terminal project in late 2016, as well as higher average debt principal balances.Income tax expense (benefit) was a benefit in 2017, compared with expense in 2016, primarily due to the $2,735 million provisional income tax benefit from the enactment of the Tax Act in December 2017. The benefit from the Tax Act was primarily due to the revaluation of deferred income taxes. This benefit was partially offset by higher income tax expense from increased income before income taxes. See Note 21—Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for more information regarding our income taxes.Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests increased $53 million in 2017, primarily due to the contributions of assets to Phillips 66 Partners during 2017 and late 2016.

This segment includes our master limited partnership (MLP), Phillips 66 Partners, as well as our 50 percent equity investment in DCP Midstream, which includes the operations of its MLP, DCP Midstream, LP (DCP Partners).2018 vs. 2017 Pre-tax income from the Midstream segment increased $543 million in 2018, compared with 2017, due to improved results across all business lines. Pre-tax income from our Transportation business increased $240 million in 2018, compared with 2017. The increase was mainly driven by higher volumes, tariffs and storage rates from our portfolio of consolidated and joint venture assets. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in equity earnings from Rockies Express Pipeline LLC (REX) due to a favorable settlement recorded in 2017.Pre-tax income from our NGL and Other business increased $273 million in 2018, compared with 2017. The increase was primarily due to the contribution of Merey Sweeny to Phillips 66 Partners in October 2017, inventory impacts, improved cargo margins and volumes, and higher equity earnings from pipeline affiliates due to increased volumes.39Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsPre-tax income from our investment in DCP Midstream increased $30 million in 2018, compared with 2017. The increase was primarily due to higher equity earnings from affiliates as a result of increased volumes, timing of incentive distribution income allocations from DCP Partners, and favorable hedging results. These increases were partially offset by higher asset impairments and operating costs in 2018. See the “Executive Overview and Business Environment” section for information on market factors impacting 2018 results.2017 vs. 2016 Pre-tax income from the Midstream segment increased $235 million in 2017, compared with 2016, due to improved results across all business lines. Pre-tax income from our Transportation business increased $88 million in 2017, compared with 2016. The improvement was mainly driven by increased equity earnings from affiliates, including our joint ventures that own the Bakken Pipeline, which started commercial operations in June 2017, as well as REX due to our share of a favorable breach of contract settlement claim. These increases were partially offset by higher operating costs. Pre-tax income from our NGL and Other business increased $37 million in 2017, compared with 2016. The increase reflected a full year of operations at the Freeport LPG Export Terminal, the contribution of Merey Sweeny to Phillips 66 Partners in October 2017, and higher equity earnings from DCP Sand Hills Pipeline, LLC (Sand Hills), partially offset by lower realized margins.Pre-tax income from our investment in DCP Midstream increased $110 million in 2017, compared with 2016. The increase was primarily due to improved margins driven by higher average NGL and natural gas prices, and improved hedging results. 40Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsChemicals Year Ended December 31 2018 2017 2016 Millions of Dollars Income Before Income Taxes$1,025 716 839 Millions of PoundsCPChem Externally Marketed Sales Volumes* Olefins and Polyolefins18,435 15,870 16,011Specialties, Aromatics and Styrenics4,931 4,618 4,911 23,366 20,488 20,922* Represents 100 percent of CPChem’s outside sales of produced petrochemical products, as well as commission sales from equity affiliates. Olefins and Polyolefins Capacity Utilization (percent)94% 87 91The Chemicals segment consists of our 50 percent interest in CPChem, which we account for under the equity method. CPChem uses NGL and other feedstocks to produce petrochemicals. These products are then marketed and sold or used as feedstocks to produce plastics and other chemicals. We structure our reporting of CPChem’s operations around two primary business lines: Olefins and Polyolefins (O&P) and Specialties, Aromatics and Styrenics (SA&S). The O&P business line produces and markets ethylene and other olefin products. Ethylene produced is primarily consumed within CPChem for the production of polyethylene, normal alpha olefins and polyethylene pipe. The SA&S business line manufactures and markets aromatics and styrenics products, such as benzene, cyclohexane, styrene and polystyrene. SA&S also manufactures and/or markets a variety of specialty chemical products. Unless otherwise noted, amounts referenced below reflect our net 50 percent interest in CPChem.2018 vs. 2017 Pre-tax income from the Chemicals segment increased $309 million in 2018, compared with 2017. The increased results reflected the commencement of full operations at CPChem’s new U.S. Gulf Coast petrochemicals assets in the second quarter of 2018, which resulted in higher production and sales of polyethylene and ethylene, partially offset by lower capitalized interest. Additionally, lower hurricane-related costs and downtime, as well as lower impairment charges, contributed to the increased results in 2018.See the “Executive Overview and Business Environment” section for information on market factors impacting CPChem’s 2018 results.2017 vs. 2016 Pre-tax income from the Chemicals segment decreased $123 million in 2017, compared with 2016. The decrease was primarily driven by higher costs and lower volumes due to Hurricane Harvey, as well as lower margins. These items were partially offset by lower impairment charges, higher equity in earnings from an O&P affiliate due to lower turnaround costs and a gain on the sale of CPChem’s K-Resin® styrene-butadiene copolymers business. CPChem recognized impairment charges of $127 million and $177 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively, due to lower demand and margin factors. As a result of these impairments, pre-tax income from the Chemicals segment was reduced by $64 million and $89 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively.As a result of Hurricane Harvey, CPChem’s Cedar Bayou facility in Baytown, Texas, experienced severe flooding, which caused it to shut down operations in the third quarter of 2017. This facility restarted in phases during the fourth quarter of 2017. Startup of CPChem’s U.S. Gulf Coast Petrochemicals Project was delayed by the flooding.41Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsRefining Year Ended December 31 2018 2017 2016 Millions of DollarsIncome (Loss) Before Income Taxes Atlantic Basin/Europe$567 448 187Gulf Coast1,040 809 69Central Corridor2,817 755 367West Coast111 64 (188)Worldwide$4,535 2,076 435 Dollars Per BarrelIncome (Loss) Before Income Taxes Atlantic Basin/Europe$3.05 2.25 0.85Gulf Coast3.55 2.83 0.24Central Corridor26.50 8.19 3.74West Coast0.81 0.48 (1.49)Worldwide6.29 2.92 0.60 Realized Refining Margins* Atlantic Basin/Europe$10.32 8.25 6.26Gulf Coast9.48 7.07 5.49Central Corridor22.22 12.44 8.70West Coast11.20 10.49 9.15Worldwide12.99 9.13 6.99* See the “Non-GAAP Reconciliations” section for a reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, income (loss) before income taxes per barrel.42Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements Thousands of Barrels Daily Year Ended December 31 2018 2017 2016Operating Statistics Refining operations* Atlantic Basin/Europe Crude oil capacity537 520 566Crude oil processed477 494 568Capacity utilization (percent)89% 95 100Refinery production514 553 607Gulf Coast Crude oil capacity752 743 743Crude oil processed717 709 704Capacity utilization (percent)95% 95 95Refinery production808 789 783Central Corridor Crude oil capacity493 493 493Crude oil processed507 467 485Capacity utilization (percent)103% 95 98Refinery production530 489 506West Coast Crude oil capacity364 360 360Crude oil processed343 342 318Capacity utilization (percent)94% 95 88Refinery production373 368 345Worldwide Crude oil capacity2,146 2,116 2,162Crude oil processed2,044 2,012 2,075Capacity utilization (percent)95% 95 96Refinery production2,225 2,199 2,241* Includes our share of equity affiliates. The Refining segment refines crude oil and other feedstocks into petroleum products (such as gasoline, distillates and aviation fuels) at 13 refineries in the United States and Europe. 2018 vs. 2017 Pre-tax income for the Refining segment increased $2,459 million in 2018, compared with 2017. The increase was primarily due to higher realized refining margins, partially offset by a noncash gain of $423 million recognized on the consolidation of Merey Sweeny in February 2017.The increased realized refining margins were primarily driven by higher feedstock advantage, improved premium coke margins, and increased optimization benefits from using our integrated logistics network to capture market opportunities related to widening Bakken, Canadian and other inland crude differentials. Improved clean product differentials and lower renewable identification number (RIN) costs also benefited margins. These items were partially offset by a decline in market crack spreads. See the “Executive Overview and Business Environment” section for information on industry crack spreads and other market factors impacting this year’s results. Our worldwide refining crude oil capacity utilization rate was 95 percent in both 2018 and 2017. 43Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements2017 vs. 2016 Pre-tax income for the Refining segment increased $1,641 million in 2017, compared with 2016. The increase was primarily due to higher realized refining margins and West Coast volumes, as well as a noncash gain of $423 million recognized on the consolidation of Merey Sweeny, partially offset by higher turnaround expenses, utilities costs and pension settlement expense. The higher realized refining margins primarily resulted from improved market crack spreads and secondary product margins, partially offset by lower feedstock advantage. See Note 5—Business Combinations, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information on the consolidation of Merey Sweeny in February 2017 and the subsequent contribution of our ownership interest in Merey Sweeny to Phillips 66 Partners in October 2017. Our worldwide refining crude oil capacity utilization rate was 95 percent in 2017, compared with 96 percent in 2016. The decrease was primarily attributable to higher turnaround activities and unplanned downtime, partially offset by improved market conditions.44Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsMarketing and Specialties Year Ended December 31 2018 2017 2016 Millions of DollarsIncome Before Income Taxes Marketing and Other$1,306 808 1,044Specialties251 212 217Total Marketing and Specialties$1,557 1,020 1,261 Dollars Per BarrelIncome Before Income Taxes U.S.$1.21 0.89 1.15International5.00 2.23 2.36 Realized Marketing Fuel Margins* U.S.$1.62 1.48 1.64International6.87 4.21 4.05* See the “Non-GAAP Reconciliations” section for a reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, income before income taxes per barrel.

Net interest expense increased $51 million in 2018, compared with 2017, mainly due to higher average debt principal balances from our issuance of senior notes totaling $1,500 million in March 2018 and Phillips 66 Partners’ issuance of senior notes totaling $650 million in October 2017. This increase was partially offset by higher interest income.The category “Other” includes environmental costs associated with sites no longer in operation, foreign currency transaction gains and losses and other costs not directly associated with an operating segment. The $76 million decrease in other costs in 2018, compared with 2017, was primarily attributable to lower environmental-related expenses and higher equity earnings from our share of income tax benefits recorded by equity affiliates due to the enactment of the Tax Act in December 2017.2017 vs. 2016 Net interest expense increased $86 million in 2017, compared with 2016, primarily driven by lower capitalized interest due to the completion of major projects, including completion of the Freeport LPG Export Terminal project in late 2016, and higher interest expense driven by higher average debt principal balances due to Phillips 66 Partners’ debt issuances in October 2017 and 2016.Corporate general and administrative expenses increased $22 million in 2017, compared with 2016, due to higher employee-related costs. Other costs increased $37 million in 2017, compared with 2016, mainly due to higher environmental-related expenses.46Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsCAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITYFinancial Indicators Millions of Dollars, Except as Indicated 2018 2017 2016 Cash and cash equivalents$3,019 3,119 2,711Net cash provided by operating activities7,573 3,648 2,963Short-term debt67 41 550Total debt11,160 10,110 10,138Total equity27,153 27,428 23,725Percent of total debt to capital*29% 27 30Percent of floating-rate debt to total debt11% 11 3* Capital includes total debt and total equity.To meet our short- and long-term liquidity requirements, we look to a variety of funding sources but rely primarily on cash generated from operating activities. Additionally, Phillips 66 Partners has raised funds for its growth activities through debt and equity financings. During 2018, we generated $7.6 billion in cash from operations and raised net proceeds of $1.5 billion from the issuance of senior notes. We used this available cash primarily for repurchases of our common stock of $4.6 billion; capital expenditures and investments of $2.6 billion; dividend payments on our common stock of $1.4 billion; and the early repayment of $550 million of debt. During 2018, cash and cash equivalents decreased by $100 million, to $3.0 billion.In addition to cash flows from operating activities, we rely on our commercial paper and credit facility programs, asset sales and our ability to issue debt securities to support our short- and long-term liquidity requirements. We believe current cash and cash equivalents and cash generated by operations, together with access to external sources of funds as described below under “Significant Sources of Capital,” will be sufficient to meet our funding requirements in the near and long term, including our capital spending, dividend payments, defined benefit plan contributions, debt repayment and share repurchases. Significant Sources of CapitalOperating ActivitiesDuring 2018, cash of $7,573 million was provided by operating activities, a 108 percent increase compared with 2017. The increase was primarily attributable to higher realized refining and marketing margins, increased distributions from our equity affiliates and lower employee benefit plan contributions. These increases were partially offset by unfavorable working capital impacts primarily driven by the effects of changes in commodity prices and the timing of payments and collections.During 2017, cash of $3,648 million was provided by operating activities, a 23 percent increase compared with 2016. The increase was primarily attributable to improved operating results due to higher realized refining margins and increased distributions from our equity affiliates. These increases were partially offset by working capital changes, reflecting the negative impact of building inventory at higher commodity prices and timing of refining payables payments, as well as lower marketing margins. Our short- and long-term operating cash flows are highly dependent upon refining and marketing margins, NGL prices and chemicals margins. Prices and margins in our industry are typically volatile, and are driven by market conditions over which we have little or no control. Absent other mitigating factors, as these prices and margins fluctuate, we would expect a corresponding change in our operating cash flows.47Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsThe level and quality of output from our refineries also impacts our cash flows. Factors such as operating efficiency, maintenance turnarounds, market conditions, feedstock availability and weather conditions can affect output. We actively manage the operations of our refineries, and any variability in their operations typically has not been as significant to cash flows as that caused by margins and prices. Our worldwide refining crude oil capacity utilization was 95 percent in both 2018 and 2017.Equity AffiliatesOur operating cash flows are also impacted by distribution decisions made by our equity affiliates, including DCP Midstream, CPChem and WRB. Over the three years ended December 31, 2018, we received aggregate distributions from our equity affiliates of $4,712 million, including $201 million from DCP Midstream, $1,603 million from CPChem and $1,124 million from WRB. CPChem resumed distributions to us in the first quarter of 2018 following the return to full operations of its Cedar Bayou facility post-Hurricane Harvey and the start-up of its new U.S. Gulf Coast petrochemicals assets. We cannot control the amount or timing of future distributions from equity affiliates; therefore, future distributions by these and other equity affiliates are not assured.Phillips 66 PartnersIn 2013, we formed Phillips 66 Partners, a publicly traded MLP, to own, operate, develop and acquire primarily fee-based midstream assets.OwnershipAt December 31, 2018, we owned a 54 percent limited partner interest and a 2 percent general partner interest in Phillips 66 Partners, while the public owned a 44 percent limited partner interest and 13.8 million perpetual convertible preferred units. We consolidate Phillips 66 Partners as a variable interest entity for financial reporting purposes. See Note 27—Phillips 66 Partners LP, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information on why we consolidate the partnership. As a result of this consolidation, the public common and preferred unitholders’ interests in Phillips 66 Partners are reflected as noncontrolling interests of $2,469 million in our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2018. Debt and Equity FinancingsDuring the three years ended December 31, 2018, Phillips 66 Partners raised net proceeds of approximately $4.1 billion from the following third-party debt and equity offerings:•In June 2018, Phillips 66 Partners completed its initial $250 million continuous offering of common units, or at-the-market (ATM) program, and commenced issuing common units under its second $250 million ATM program. Since inception in June 2016 through December 31, 2018, net proceeds of $320 million have been received under these programs.•In October 2017, Phillips 66 Partners received net proceeds of $643 million from the issuance of $500 million of 3.750% Senior Notes due March 2028 and $150 million of 4.680% Senior Notes due February 2045.•In October 2017, Phillips 66 Partners received net proceeds of $737 million from a private placement of 13,819,791 perpetual convertible preferred units, at a price of $54.27 per unit.•In October 2017, Phillips 66 Partners received net proceeds of $295 million from a private placement of 6,304,204 common units, at a price of $47.59 per unit.•In October 2016, Phillips 66 Partners received net proceeds of $1,111 million from the issuance of $500 million of 3.550% Senior Notes due October 2026 and $625 million of 4.900% Senior Notes due October 2046.•In August 2016, Phillips 66 Partners received net proceeds of $299 million from a public offering of 6,000,000 common units, at a price of $50.22 per unit.•In May 2016, Phillips 66 Partners received net proceeds of $656 million from a public offering of 12,650,000 common units, at a price of $52.40 per unit.48Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsPhillips 66 Partners primarily used these net proceeds to fund the cash portion of acquisitions of assets from Phillips 66 and for capital spending and investments. See Note 27—Phillips 66 Partners LP, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information on Phillips 66 Partners.Credit Facilities and Commercial PaperPhillips 66 has a $5 billion revolving credit facility that extends until October 2021. This facility may be used for direct bank borrowings, as support for issuances of letters of credit, or as support for our commercial paper program. The facility is with a broad syndicate of financial institutions and contains covenants that are usual and customary for an agreement of this type for comparable commercial borrowers, including a maximum consolidated net debt-to-capitalization ratio of 60 percent. The agreement has customary events of default, such as nonpayment of principal when due; nonpayment of interest, fees or other amounts; violation of covenants; cross-payment default and cross-acceleration (in each case, to indebtedness in excess of a threshold amount); and a change of control. Borrowings under the facility will incur interest at the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a margin based on the credit rating of our senior unsecured long-term debt as determined from time to time by Standard & Poor’s Financial Services LLC (S&P) and Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. (Moody’s). The facility also provides for customary fees, including administrative agent fees and commitment fees. At December 31, 2018, no amount had been drawn under this revolving credit agreement.Phillips 66 has a $5 billion commercial paper program for short-term working capital needs that is supported by its revolving credit facility. Commercial paper maturities are generally limited to 90 days. At December 31, 2018, no borrowings were outstanding under the commercial paper program.Phillips 66 Partners has a $750 million revolving credit facility that extends until October 2021. The Phillips 66 Partners facility is with a broad syndicate of financial institutions and contains covenants that are usual and customary for an agreement of this type for comparable commercial borrowers. At Phillips 66 Partners’ option, outstanding borrowings under this facility bear interest at either i) the Eurodollar rate plus a margin based on its credit rating; or ii) the base rate (as described in the facility agreement) plus a margin based on its credit rating. Eurodollar rate borrowings are due on the facility’s termination date, while base rate borrowings are due the earlier of the facility’s termination date or the fourteenth business day after such borrowings were made. At December 31, 2018, Phillips 66 Partners had borrowings of $125 million outstanding under this facility.Other Debt Issuances and FinancingsOn March 1, 2018, Phillips 66 closed on a public offering of $1,500 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured notes consisting of:•$500 million of floating-rate Senior Notes due February 2021. Interest on these notes is equal to the three-month LIBOR plus 0.60% per annum and is payable quarterly in arrears on February 26, May 26, August 26 and November 26, beginning on May 29, 2018. •$800 million of 3.900% Senior Notes due March 2028. Interest on these notes is payable semiannually on March 15 and September 15 of each year, beginning on September 15, 2018.•An additional $200 million of our 4.875% Senior Notes due November 2044. Interest on these notes is payable semiannually on May 15 and November 15 of each year, beginning on May 15, 2018. Phillips 66 used the net proceeds from the issuance of these notes and cash on hand to repay commercial paper borrowings during the first quarter of 2018, and for general corporate purposes. The commercial paper borrowings during the first quarter of 2018, were primarily used to repurchase shares of our common stock. See Note 17—Equity, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information.In addition, we have capital lease obligations related to equipment and transportation assets, and the use of an oil terminal in the United Kingdom. These leases mature within the next fifteen years. The present value of our minimum capital lease payments for these obligations as of December 31, 2018, was $184 million.49Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsAvailability of Debt and Equity FinancingOur senior unsecured long-term debt has been rated investment grade by S&P (BBB+) and Moody’s (A3). We do not have any ratings triggers on any of our corporate debt that would cause an automatic default, and thereby impact our access to liquidity, in the event of a downgrade of our credit rating. If our credit rating deteriorated to a level prohibiting us from accessing the commercial paper market, we would expect to be able to access funds under our liquidity facilities mentioned above.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsUnder the operating lease agreement on our headquarters facility in Houston, Texas, we have a residual value guarantee with a maximum future exposure of $554 million at December 31, 2018. The operating lease term ends in June 2021 and provides us the option, at the end of the lease term, to request to renew the lease, purchase the facility or assist the lessor in marketing it for resale. We also have residual value guarantees associated with railcar and airplane leases with maximum future exposures totaling $300 million at December 31, 2018, which have remaining terms of up to five years.In addition, we have guarantees outstanding related to certain joint venture debt and purchase obligations, which have remaining terms of up to seven years. The maximum potential amount of future payments to third parties under these guarantees was approximately $304 million at December 31, 2018. See Note 13—Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information on our guarantees.Capital RequirementsCapital Expenditures and InvestmentsFor information about our capital expenditures and investments, see the “Capital Spending” section below. Debt FinancingOur debt balance at December 31, 2018, was $11.2 billion and our total debt-to-capital ratio was 29 percent. In 2018, Phillips 66 made early debt repayments totaling $550 million, comprised of $300 million floating-rate notes due April 2019 and $250 million of the $450 million outstanding under its three-year term loan facility due April 2020.See Note 12—Debt, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for our annual debt maturities over the next five years and more information on debt repayments.DividendsOn February 6, 2019, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.80 per common share, payable March 1, 2019, to holders of record at the close of business on February 19, 2019. We are forecasting a double-digit percentage increase in our quarterly dividend rate in 2019.Share RepurchasesSince July 2012, our Board of Directors has, at various times, authorized repurchases of our outstanding common stock under our share repurchase program, which aggregate to a total authorization of up to $12 billion. The share repurchases are expected to be funded primarily through available cash. The shares will be repurchased from time to time in the open market at our discretion, subject to market conditions and other factors, and in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements. Since the inception of our share repurchase program in 2012 through December 31, 2018, we have repurchased approximately 137 million shares at an aggregate cost of $10.4 billion. Shares of stock repurchased are held as treasury shares.50Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsIn February 2018, we entered into a Stock Purchase and Sale Agreement (Purchase Agreement) with Berkshire Hathaway Inc. and National Indemnity Company, a wholly owned subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway, to repurchase 35 million shares of Phillips 66 common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $3.3 billion. Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, the purchase price per share of $93.725 was based on the volume-weighted-average price of our common stock on the New York Stock Exchange on February 13, 2018. The transaction closed in February 2018. We funded the repurchase with cash of $1.9 billion and borrowings of $1.4 billion under our commercial paper program. These borrowings were subsequently refinanced through a public offering of senior notes. This specific share repurchase transaction was separately authorized by our Board of Directors and therefore did not impact previously announced authorizations under our share repurchase program, which are discussed above.Employee Benefit Plan ContributionsFor the year ended December 31, 2018, we contributed $150 million to our U.S. employee benefit plans and $34 million to our international employee benefit plans. In 2019, we expect to contribute approximately $90 million to those plans.51Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsContractual ObligationsThe following table summarizes our aggregate contractual fixed and variable obligations as of December 31, 2018: Millions of Dollars Payments Due by Period Total Up to1 Year Years2-3 Years4-5 After5 Years Debt obligations (a)$11,076 50 1,450 2,000 7,576Capital lease obligations184 17 26 22 119Total debt11,260 67 1,476 2,022 7,695Interest on debt7,284 477 905 743 5,159Operating lease obligations1,581 509 573 207 292Purchase obligations (b)71,834 31,361 8,547 5,317 26,609Other long-term liabilities (c) Asset retirement obligations261 7 44 20 190Accrued environmental costs447 76 132 89 150Repatriation income tax liability (d)181 14 32 46 89Total$92,848 32,511 11,709 8,444 40,184 (a)For additional information, see Note 12—Debt, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.(b)Represents any agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable, legally binding and specifies all significant terms. We expect these purchase obligations will be fulfilled with operating cash flows in the applicable maturity period. The majority of the purchase obligations are market-based contracts, including exchanges and futures, for the purchase of products such as crude oil and raw NGL. The products are used to supply our refineries and fractionators and optimize our supply chain. Product purchase commitments with third parties totaled $31,242 million. In addition, $20,642 million are product purchases from CPChem, mostly for fuel gas and natural gasoline over the remaining contractual term of 81 years, and product purchases of $4,797 million from DCP Midstream entities for NGL over the remaining contractual term of ten years. Purchase obligations of $4,832 million are related to agreements to access and utilize the capacity of third-party equipment and facilities, including pipelines and product terminals, to transport, process, treat, and store products. The remainder is primarily our net share of purchase commitments for materials and services for jointly owned facilities where we are the operator.(c)Excludes pensions and unrecognized income tax benefits. From 2019 through 2023, we expect to contribute an average of $120 million per year to our qualified and nonqualified pension and other postretirement benefit plans in the United States and an average of $25 million per year to our non-U.S. plans. The U.S. five-year average consists of approximately $60 million for 2019 and $135 million per year for the remaining four years. Our minimum funding in 2019 is expected to be $60 million in the United States and $30 million outside the United States. Unrecognized income tax benefits of $23 million were also excluded because the ultimate disposition and timing of any payments to be made with regard to such amounts are not reasonably estimable.(d)We elected to pay the one-time deemed repatriation income tax on foreign-sourced earnings, recognized as a result of the Tax Act enacted in December 2017, in installments over eight years beginning in 2018. The amount represents the remaining income tax liability.52Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsCapital Spending Millions of Dollars 2019Budget 2018 2017 2016Capital Expenditures and Investments Midstream*$1,936 1,548 771 1,453Chemicals— — — —Refining923 826 853 1,149Marketing and Specialties161 125 108 98Corporate and Other177 140 100 144 $3,197 2,639 1,832 2,844 Selected Equity Affiliates** DCP Midstream$505 484 268 99CPChem572 339 776 987WRB165 156 126 164 $1,242 979 1,170 1,250* 2019 budget includes $303 million of capital expected to be cash funded by noncontrolling interests.** Our share of joint venture’s self-funded capital spending.MidstreamCapital spending in our Midstream segment during the three-year period ended December 31, 2018, included:•Construction activities related to additional Gulf Coast fractionation capacity and Freeport LPG Export Terminal projects.•Construction activities related to increasing storage capacity at our crude oil and refined petroleum products terminal located near Beaumont, Texas.•Development of the Gray Oak Pipeline system, which will provide crude oil transportation from the Permian Basin and Eagle Ford to destinations in the Corpus Christi and Sweeny/Freeport markets on the Texas Gulf Coast. At December 31, 2018, Phillips 66 Partners had a 48.75 percent effective ownership interest in this pipeline system. In February 2019, another party exercised its option to acquire an interest in the pipeline system that reduced Phillips 66 Partners’ effective ownership interest to 42.25 percent.•Development of the Bayou Bridge Pipeline by Phillips 66 Partners’ 40-percent-owned joint venture.•Acquisition by Phillips 66 Partners of certain southeast Louisiana NGL logistics assets comprising approximately 500 miles of pipelines and a storage cavern connecting multiple fractionation facilities, refineries and a petrochemical facility.•Development of the Bakken Pipeline system project, in which Phillips 66 Partners owns a 25 percent interest.•Expansion activities on the Phillips 66 Partners’ 33-percent-owned Sand Hills Pipeline including investment in the transportation of NGL from the Permian Basin to the Texas Gulf Coast. •Construction activities related to Phillips 66 Partners’ new isomerization unit at the Lake Charles Refinery.•Expansion activities on the Phillips 66 Partners’ 50-percent owned STACK Pipeline joint venture.•Construction activities by joint ventures of Phillips 66 Partners in the Bakken production area of North Dakota, including the Palermo Rail Terminal, Sacagawea Crude Pipeline, the New Town injection point, Keene CDP Terminal and Sacagawea Gas Pipeline. •Spending associated with other return, reliability and maintenance projects in our Transportation and NGL business.53Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsDuring the three-year period ended December 31, 2018, DCP Midstream’s self-funded capital expenditures and investments were $1.7 billion on a 100 percent basis. Capital spending during this period was primarily for expansion of owned and joint venture natural gas processing and pipeline capacity. In 2018, REX repaid $550 million of its debt, reducing its total debt to approximately $2 billion. REX funded the repayment through member cash contributions, of which our 25 percent share was approximately $138 million.ChemicalsDuring the three-year period ended December 31, 2018, CPChem had a self-funded capital program, and thus required no new capital infusions from us or our co-venturer. During this period, on a 100 percent basis, CPChem’s capital expenditures and investments were $4.2 billion. Capital spending during this period was primarily for the U.S. Gulf Coast Petrochemicals Project.RefiningCapital spending for the Refining segment during the three-year period ended December 31, 2018, was $2.8 billion, primarily for air emission reduction and clean fuels projects to meet new environmental standards, refinery upgrade projects to increase processing of advantaged crudes and improve product yields, improvements to the operating integrity of key processing units, and safety-related projects. Generally, our equity affiliates in the Refining segment are expected to have self-funding capital programs. During this three-year period, on a 100 percent basis, WRB’s capital expenditures and investments were $892 million.Key projects completed during the three-year period included: •Installation of facilities to improve clean product yield at the Sweeny, Lake Charles, Ponca City, and Bayway refineries, as well as the jointly owned Wood River Refinery.•Installation of facilities to improve processing of advantaged crudes at the Billings and Lake Charles refineries, as well as the jointly owned Wood River Refinery. •Installation of facilities to comply with U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Tier 3 gasoline regulations at the Alliance, Lake Charles, Bayway and Sweeny refineries, as well as the jointly owned Wood River Refinery.•Installation of a crude tank to increase accessibility of waterborne crude at the Los Angeles Refinery.Major construction activities in progress include: •Installation of facilities to comply with EPA Tier 3 gasoline regulations at the Ferndale Refinery.•Installation of facilities to improve product value at the Sweeny and Lake Charles refineries, as well as the jointly owned Borger Refinery.•Installation of facilities for U.K. biofuels compliance at the Humber Refinery.Marketing and SpecialtiesCapital spending for the M&S segment during the three-year period ended December 31, 2018, was primarily for the acquisition and further development of new international retail sites. In addition, capital was used for reliability and maintenance projects at our lubricants and power generation facilities.Corporate and OtherCapital spending for Corporate and Other during the three-year period ended December 31, 2018, was primarily for information technology and facilities.54Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements2019 BudgetOur 2019 capital budget is $3.2 billion including Phillips 66 Partners’ expected capital spending of $0.9 billion. This excludes our portion of planned capital spending by joint ventures DCP Midstream, CPChem and WRB totaling $1.2 billion, all of which is expected to be self-funded. Phillips 66 Partners’ expected capital spending includes $0.3 billion of capital expected to be cash funded by noncontrolling interests.The Midstream capital budget of $1.9 billion includes 300,000 barrels per day of additional fractionation capacity at the Sweeny Hub, as well as ongoing expansion of the Beaumont Terminal and pipeline investments providing integration across our value chain. The Midstream capital budget also includes growth capital at Phillips 66 Partners to support organic projects, including the Gray Oak Pipeline, South Texas Gateway Terminal, Clemens Caverns expansion, an isomerization unit at the Phillips 66 Lake Charles Refinery, and the Sweeny to Pasadena Pipeline. Refining’s capital budget of $0.9 billion is primarily directed toward reliability, safety and environmental projects, as well as high-return projects to enhance the yield of higher-value products, including an upgrade of the fluid catalytic cracking unit at the Sweeny Refinery, and other low-capital, quick-payout projects. In M&S, we plan to invest approximately $0.2 billion of growth and sustaining capital; the investment will further grow and enhance retail sites in Europe. In Corporate and Other, we plan to fund approximately $0.2 billion in projects primarily related to information technology projects, including implementation of a new enterprise resource planning system.ContingenciesA number of lawsuits involving a variety of claims that arose in the ordinary course of business have been filed against us or are subject to indemnifications provided by us. We also may be required to remove or mitigate the effects on the environment of the placement, storage, disposal or release of certain chemical, mineral and petroleum substances at various active and inactive sites. We regularly assess the need for financial recognition or disclosure of these contingencies. In the case of all known contingencies (other than those related to income taxes), we accrue a liability when the loss is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable. If a range of amounts can be reasonably estimated and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount, then the minimum of the range is accrued. We do not reduce these liabilities for potential insurance or third-party recoveries. If applicable, we accrue receivables for probable insurance or other third-party recoveries. In the case of income-tax-related contingencies, we use a cumulative probability-weighted loss accrual in cases where sustaining a tax position is less than certain.Based on currently available information, we believe it is remote that future costs related to known contingent liability exposures will exceed current accruals by an amount that would have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements. As we learn new facts concerning contingencies, we reassess our position both with respect to accrued liabilities and other potential exposures. Estimates particularly sensitive to future changes include contingent liabilities recorded for environmental remediation, tax and legal matters. Estimated future environmental remediation costs are subject to change due to such factors as the uncertain magnitude of cleanup costs, the unknown time and extent of such remedial actions that may be required, and the determination of our liability in proportion to that of other potentially responsible parties. Estimated future costs related to tax and legal matters are subject to change as events evolve and as additional information becomes available during the administrative and litigation processes.Legal and Tax MattersOur legal and tax matters are handled by our legal and tax organizations. These organizations apply their knowledge, experience and professional judgment to the specific characteristics of our cases and uncertain tax positions. We employ a litigation management process to manage and monitor the legal proceedings against us. Our process facilitates the early evaluation and quantification of potential exposures in individual cases and enables the tracking of those cases that have been scheduled for trial and/or mediation. Based on professional judgment and experience in using these litigation management tools and available information about current developments in all our cases, our legal organization regularly assesses the adequacy of current accruals and determines if adjustment of existing accruals, or establishment of new accruals, is required. In the case of income-tax-related contingencies, we monitor tax legislation and court decisions, the status of tax audits and the statute of limitations within which a taxing authority can assert a liability. See Note 21—Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information about income-tax-related contingencies.55Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsEnvironmentalLike other companies in our industry, we are subject to numerous international, federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. Among the most significant of these international and federal environmental laws and regulations are the: •U.S. Federal Clean Air Act, which governs air emissions.•U.S. Federal Clean Water Act, which governs discharges into water bodies.•European Union Regulation for Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH), which governs the manufacture, placing on the market or use of chemicals.•U.S. Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), which imposes liability on generators, transporters and arrangers of hazardous substances at sites where hazardous substance releases have occurred or are threatening to occur.•U.S. Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), which governs the treatment, storage and disposal of solid waste.•U.S. Federal Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA), which requires facilities to report toxic chemical inventories to local emergency planning committees and response departments.•U.S. Federal Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA90), under which owners and operators of onshore facilities and pipelines as well as owners and operators of vessels are liable for removal costs and damages that result from a discharge of oil into navigable waters of the United States.•European Union Trading Directive resulting in the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS), which uses a market-based mechanism to incentivize the reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.These laws and their implementing regulations set limits on emissions and, in the case of discharges to water, establish water quality limits. They also, in most cases, require permits in association with new or modified operations. These permits can require an applicant to collect substantial information in connection with the application process, which can be expensive and time consuming. In addition, there can be delays associated with notice and comment periods and the agency’s processing of the application. Many of the delays associated with the permitting process are beyond the control of the applicant.Many states and foreign countries where we operate also have, or are developing, similar environmental laws and regulations governing these same types of activities. While similar, in some cases these regulations may impose additional, or more stringent, requirements that can add to the cost and difficulty of developing infrastructure and marketing and transporting products across state and international borders. For example, in California the South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD) approved amendments to the Regional Clean Air Incentives Market (RECLAIM) that became effective in 2016, which require a phased reduction of nitrogen oxide emissions through 2022 and affect refineries in the Los Angeles metropolitan area. In 2017, SCAQMD required additional nitrogen dioxide emissions reductions through 2025 and is now promulgating new regulations to replace the RECLAIM program with a traditional command and controls regulatory regime.The ultimate financial impact arising from environmental laws and regulations is neither clearly known nor easily determinable as new standards, such as air emission standards, water quality standards and stricter fuel regulations, continue to evolve. However, environmental laws and regulations, including those that may arise to address concerns about global climate change, are expected to continue to have an increasing impact on our operations in the United States and in other countries in which we operate. Notable areas of potential impacts include air emission compliance and remediation obligations in the United States.An example of this in the fuels area is the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA). It requires fuel producers and importers to provide additional renewable fuels for transportation motor fuels and stipulates a mix of various types to be included through 2022. We have met the increasingly stringent requirements to date while establishing implementation, operating and capital strategies, along with advanced technology development, to address projected future requirements. It is uncertain how various future requirements contained in EISA, and the regulations promulgated thereunder, may be implemented and what their full impact may be on our operations. For the 2019 compliance year, the EPA has set volumes of advanced and total renewable fuel at higher levels than in previous years (the 2019 compliance year volumes are approximately 3 percent higher than those required for the 2018 and 2017 compliance years); it is uncertain if these increased obligations will be achievable by fuel producers and shippers without 56Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statementsdrawing on the RIN bank. EISA requires EPA to reset the statutory volumes if EPA waives the volumes by 20 percent or more for two consecutive years. The 2019 rulemaking triggered this requirement and EPA is currently working on rulemaking that will set volumes for 2020 through 2022. Additionally, we may experience a decrease in demand for refined petroleum products due to the regulatory program as currently promulgated. This program continues to be the subject of possible Congressional review and re-promulgation in revised form, and the EPA’s regulations pertaining to the 2014 through 2018 compliance years are subject to legal challenge, further creating uncertainty regarding renewable fuel volume requirements and obligations. Additionally, the market for RINs has been the subject of fraudulent third-party activity, and it is reasonably possible that some RINs that we have purchased may be determined to be invalid. Should that occur, we could incur costs to replace those fraudulent RINs. Although the cost for replacing any fraudulently marketed RINs is not reasonably estimable at this time, we would not expect to incur the full financial impact of fraudulent RINs replacement costs in any single interim or annual period, and would not expect such costs to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition.We also are subject to certain laws and regulations relating to environmental remediation obligations associated with current and past operations. Such laws and regulations include CERCLA and RCRA and their state equivalents. Remediation obligations include cleanup responsibility arising from petroleum releases from underground storage tanks located at numerous previously and currently owned and/or operated petroleum-marketing outlets throughout the United States. Federal and state laws require contamination caused by such underground storage tank releases be assessed and remediated to meet applicable standards. In addition to other cleanup standards, many states have adopted cleanup criteria for methyl tertiary-butyl ether for both soil and groundwater.At RCRA-permitted facilities, we are required to assess environmental conditions. If conditions warrant, we may be required to remediate contamination caused by prior operations. In contrast to CERCLA, which is often referred to as “Superfund,” the cost of corrective action activities under RCRA corrective action programs typically is borne solely by us. We anticipate increased expenditures for RCRA remediation activities may be required, but such annual expenditures for the near term are not expected to vary significantly from the range of such expenditures we have experienced over the past few years. Longer-term expenditures are subject to considerable uncertainty and may fluctuate significantly.We occasionally receive requests for information or notices of potential liability from the EPA and state environmental agencies alleging that we are a potentially responsible party under CERCLA or an equivalent state statute. On occasion, we also have been made a party to cost recovery litigation by those agencies or by private parties. These requests, notices and lawsuits assert potential liability for remediation costs at various sites that typically are not owned by us, but allegedly contain wastes attributable to our past operations. As of December 31, 2017, we reported that we had been notified of potential liability under CERCLA and comparable state laws at 31 sites within the United States. During 2018, we were notified of one new site, one previously resolved site that was returned to active status, four sites that were deemed resolved and closed, and two sites that were deemed resolved but not closed, leaving 27 unresolved sites with potential liability at December 31, 2018. For most Superfund sites, our potential liability will be significantly less than the total site remediation costs because the percentage of waste attributable to us, versus that attributable to all other potentially responsible parties, is relatively low. Although liability of those potentially responsible is generally joint and several for federal sites and frequently so for state sites, other potentially responsible parties at sites where we are a party typically have had the financial strength to meet their obligations, and where they have not, or where potentially responsible parties could not be located, our share of liability has not increased materially. Many of the sites for which we are potentially responsible are still under investigation by the EPA or the state agencies concerned. Prior to actual cleanup, those potentially responsible normally assess site conditions, apportion responsibility and determine the appropriate remediation. In some instances, we may have no liability or attain a settlement of liability. Actual cleanup costs generally occur after the parties obtain EPA or equivalent state agency approval of a remediation plan. There are relatively few sites where we are a major participant, and given the timing and amounts of anticipated expenditures, neither the cost of remediation at those sites nor such costs at all CERCLA sites, in the aggregate, is expected to have a material adverse effect on our competitive or financial condition.Expensed environmental costs were $690 million in 2018 and are expected to be approximately $740 million and $700 million in 2019 and 2020, respectively. Capitalized environmental costs were $149 million in 2018 and are expected to be approximately $115 million and $125 million, in 2019 and 2020, respectively. This amount does not include capital expenditures made for another purpose that have an indirect benefit on environmental compliance.57Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsAccrued liabilities for remediation activities are not reduced for potential recoveries from insurers or other third parties and are not discounted (except those assumed in a business combination, which we record on a discounted basis).Many of these liabilities result from CERCLA, RCRA and similar state laws that require us to undertake certain investigative and remedial activities at sites where we conduct, or once conducted, operations or at sites where our generated waste was disposed. We also have accrued for a number of sites we identified that may require environmental remediation, but which are not currently the subject of CERCLA, RCRA or state enforcement activities. If applicable, we accrue receivables for probable insurance or other third-party recoveries. In the future, we may incur significant costs under both CERCLA and RCRA. Remediation activities vary substantially in duration and cost from site to site, depending on the mix of unique site characteristics, evolving remediation technologies, diverse regulatory agencies and enforcement policies, and the presence or absence of potentially liable third parties. Therefore, it is difficult to develop reasonable estimates of future site remediation costs.Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, and as with other companies engaged in similar businesses, environmental costs and liabilities are inherent concerns in certain of our operations and products, and there can be no assurance that material costs and liabilities will not be incurred. However, we currently do not expect any material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position as a result of compliance with current environmental laws and regulations.Climate ChangeThere has been a broad range of proposed or promulgated state, national and international laws focusing on GHG emissions reduction, including various regulations proposed or issued by the EPA. These proposed or promulgated laws apply or could apply in states and/or countries where we have interests or may have interests in the future. Laws regulating GHG emissions continue to evolve, and while it is not possible to accurately estimate either a timetable for implementation or our future compliance costs relating to implementation, such laws potentially could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition as a result of increasing costs of compliance, lengthening project implementation and agency reviews, or reducing demand for certain hydrocarbon products. Examples of legislation or precursors for possible regulation that do or could affect our operations include: •EU ETS, which is part of the European Union’s policy to combat climate change and is a key tool for reducing industrial GHG emissions. EU ETS impacts factories, power stations and other installations across all EU member states. •California’s Global Warming Solutions Act, which requires the California Air Resources Board to develop regulations and market mechanisms that will target reduction of California’s GHG emissions by 25 percent by 2020 (as well as SB32, which requires further reduction of California's GHG emissions to 40 percent below the 1990 emission level by 2030, and AB398, which extends the California GHG emission cap-and-trade program through 2030). Other GHG emissions programs in the western U.S. states have been enacted or are under consideration or development, including amendments to California's Low Carbon Fuel Standard, Oregon's Low Carbon Fuel Standard, and Washington's carbon reduction programs.•The U.S. Supreme Court decision in Massachusetts v. EPA, 549 U.S. 497, 127 S. Ct. 1438 (2007), confirming that the EPA has the authority to regulate carbon dioxide as an “air pollutant” under the Federal Clean Air Act.•The EPA’s announcement on March 29, 2010 (published as “Interpretation of Regulations that Determine Pollutants Covered by Clean Air Act Permitting Programs,” 75 Fed. Reg. 17004 (April 2, 2010)), and the EPA’s and U.S. Department of Transportation’s joint promulgation of a Final Rule on April 1, 2010, that triggers regulation of GHGs under the Clean Air Act. These collectively may lead to more climate-based claims for damages, and may result in longer agency review time for development projects to determine the extent of potential climate change. •EPA's 2015 Final Rule regulating GHG emissions from existing fossil fuel-fired electrical generating units under the Federal Clean Air Act, commonly referred to as the Clean Power Plan, which remains the subject of litigation and administrative review.•Carbon taxes in certain jurisdictions.•GHG emission cap and trade programs in certain jurisdictions.In the EU, the first phase of the EU ETS completed at the end of 2007 and Phase II was undertaken from 2008 through 2012. The current phase (Phase III) runs from 2013 through to 2020, with the main changes being reduced allocation of free allowances and increased auctioning of new allowances. Phillips 66 has assets that are subject to the EU ETS, and the company is actively engaged in minimizing any financial impact from the EU ETS.58Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsFrom November 30 to December 12, 2015, more than 190 countries, including the United States, participated in the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris, France. The conference culminated in what is known as the “Paris Agreement,” which, upon certain conditions being met, entered into force on November 4, 2016. The Paris Agreement establishes a commitment by signatory parties to pursue domestic GHG emission reductions. In 2017, the President of the United States announced his intention to withdraw the United States from the Paris Agreement. In the United States, some additional form of regulation is likely to be forthcoming in the future at the state or federal levels with respect to GHG emissions. Such regulation could take any of several forms that may result in the creation of additional costs in the form of taxes, the restriction of output, investments of capital to maintain compliance with laws and regulations, or required acquisition or trading of emission allowances. We are working to continuously improve operational and energy efficiency through resource and energy conservation throughout our operations.Compliance with changes in laws and regulations that create a GHG emission trading program, GHG reduction requirements or carbon taxes could significantly increase our costs, reduce demand for fossil energy derived products, impact the cost and availability of capital and increase our exposure to litigation. Such laws and regulations could also increase demand for less carbon intensive energy sources. An example of one such program is California’s cap and trade program, which was promulgated pursuant to the State’s Global Warming Solutions Act. The program had been limited to certain stationary sources, which include our refineries in California, but beginning in January 2015 was expanded to include emissions from transportation fuels distributed in California. Inclusion of transportation fuels in California’s cap and trade program as currently promulgated has increased our cap and trade program compliance costs. The ultimate impact on our financial performance, either positive or negative, from this and similar programs, will depend on a number of factors, including, but not limited to: •Whether and to what extent legislation or regulation is enacted.•The nature of the legislation or regulation (such as a cap and trade system or a tax on emissions).•The GHG reductions required.•The price and availability of offsets.•The demand for, and amount and allocation of allowances.•Technological and scientific developments leading to new products or services.•Any potential significant physical effects of climate change (such as increased severe weather events, changes in sea levels and changes in temperature).•Whether, and the extent to which, increased compliance costs are ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services.We consider and take into account anticipated future GHG emissions in designing and developing major facilities and projects, and implement energy efficiency initiatives to reduce GHG emissions. Data on our GHG emissions, legal requirements regulating such emissions, and the possible physical effects of climate change on our coastal assets are incorporated into our planning, investment, and risk management decision-making.59Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATESThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP) requires management to select appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. See Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for descriptions of our major accounting policies. Some of these accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent that there is a reasonable likelihood that materially different amounts would have been reported under different conditions, or if different assumptions had been used. The following discussion of critical accounting estimates, along with the discussion of contingencies in this report, address all important accounting areas where the nature of accounting estimates or assumptions could be material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change.ImpairmentsLong-lived assets used in operations are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate a possible significant deterioration in future expected cash flows. If the sum of the undiscounted expected future pre-tax cash flows of an asset group is less than the carrying value, including applicable liabilities, the carrying value is written down to estimated fair value. Individual assets are grouped for impairment purposes based on a judgmental assessment of the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets (for example, at a refinery complex level). Because there usually is a lack of quoted market prices for long-lived assets, the fair value of impaired assets is typically determined using one or more of the following methods: the present value of expected future cash flows using discount rates and other assumptions believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants; a market multiple of earnings for similar assets; or historical market transactions of similar assets, adjusted using principal market participant assumptions when necessary. The expected future cash flows used for impairment reviews and related fair value calculations are based on judgmental assessments of future volumes, commodity prices, operating costs, margins, discount rates and capital project decisions, considering all available information at the date of review.Investments in nonconsolidated entities accounted for under the equity method are assessed for impairment when there are indicators of a loss in value, such as a lack of sustained earnings capacity or a current fair value less than the investment’s carrying amount. When it is determined that an indicated impairment is other than temporary, a charge is recognized for the difference between the investment’s carrying value and its estimated fair value. When determining whether a decline in value is other than temporary, management considers factors such as the length of time and extent of the decline, the investee’s financial condition and near-term prospects, and our ability and intention to retain our investment for a period that allows for recovery. When quoted market prices are not available, the fair value is usually based on the present value of expected future cash flows using discount rates and other assumptions believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants and a market analysis of comparable assets, if appropriate. Different assumptions could affect the timing and the amount of an impairment of an investment in any period.Asset Retirement ObligationsUnder various contracts, permits and regulations, we have legal obligations to remove tangible equipment and restore the land at the end of operations at certain operational sites. Our largest asset removal obligations involve asbestos abatement at refineries. Estimating the timing and cost of future asset removals is difficult. Most of these removal obligations are many years, or decades, in the future, and the contracts and regulations often have vague descriptions of what removal practices and criteria must be met when the removal event actually occurs. Asset removal technologies and costs, regulatory and other compliance considerations, expenditure timing, and other inputs into valuation of the obligation, including discount and inflation rates, are also subject to change.Environmental CostsIn addition to asset retirement obligations discussed above, we have certain obligations to complete environmental-related projects. These projects are primarily related to cleanup at domestic refineries, underground storage sites and non-operated sites. Future environmental remediation costs are difficult to estimate because they are subject to change due to such factors as the uncertain magnitude of cleanup costs, timing and extent of such remedial actions that may be required, and the determination of our liability in proportion to that of other responsible parties.60Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsIntangible Assets and GoodwillAt December 31, 2018, we had $753 million of intangible assets that we have determined to have indefinite useful lives, and therefore are not amortized. The judgmental determination that an intangible asset has an indefinite useful life is continuously evaluated. If, due to changes in facts and circumstances, management determines these intangible assets have finite useful lives, amortization will commence at that time on a prospective basis. As long as these intangible assets are determined to have indefinite lives, they will be subject to at least annual impairment tests that require management’s judgment of their estimated fair value.At December 31, 2018, we had $3.3 billion of goodwill recorded in conjunction with past business combinations. Goodwill is not amortized. Instead, goodwill is subject to at least annual tests for impairment at a reporting unit level. A reporting unit is an operating segment or a component that is one level below an operating segment and they are determined primarily based on the manner in which the business is managed. We perform our annual goodwill impairment test using either a qualitative assessment or a quantitative assessment. As part of our qualitative assessment, we evaluate relevant events and circumstances that could affect the fair value of our reporting units, including macroeconomic conditions, overall industry and market considerations and regulatory changes, as well as company-specific market metrics, performance and events. The evaluation of company-specific events and circumstances includes evaluating changes in our stock price and cost of capital, actual and forecasted financial performance, as well as the effect of significant asset dispositions. If our qualitative assessment indicates it is likely the fair value of a reporting unit has declined below its carrying value (including goodwill), or if we elect not to perform a qualitative assessment, a quantitative assessment is performed.When a quantitative assessment is performed, management applies judgment in determining the estimated fair values of the reporting units because quoted market prices for our reporting units are not available. Management uses available information to make this fair value determination, including estimated cash flows, cost of capital, observed market earnings multiples of comparable companies, our common stock price and associated total company market capitalization. We completed our annual impairment test as of October 1, 2018, and concluded that the fair values of our reporting units continued to exceed their respective carrying values (including goodwill) by significant percentages. A decline in the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting units in the future could result in an impairment. As such, we continue to monitor for indicators of impairment until our next annual impairment test is performed.Tax Assets and LiabilitiesOur operations are subject to various taxes, including federal, state and foreign income taxes, property taxes, and transactional taxes such as excise, sales/use and payroll taxes. We record tax liabilities based on our assessment of existing tax laws and regulations. The recording of tax liabilities requires significant judgment and estimates. We recognize the financial statement effects of an income tax position when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination by a taxing authority. A contingent liability related to a transactional tax claim is recorded if the loss is both probable and estimable. Actual incurred tax liabilities can vary from our estimates for a variety of reasons, including different interpretations of tax laws and regulations and different assessments of the amount of tax due.In determining our income tax expense (benefit), we assess the likelihood our deferred tax assets will be recovered through future taxable income. Valuation allowances reduce deferred tax assets to an amount that will, more likely than not, be realized. Judgment is required in estimating the amount of valuation allowance, if any, that should be recorded against our deferred tax assets. Based on our historical taxable income, our expectations for the future, and available tax-planning strategies, we expect the net deferred tax assets will more likely than not be realized as offsets to reversing deferred tax liabilities and as reductions to future taxable income. If our actual results of operations differ from such estimates or our estimates of future taxable income change, the valuation allowance may need to be revised.New tax laws and regulations, as well as changes to existing tax laws and regulations, are continuously being proposed or promulgated. The implementation of future legislative and regulatory tax initiatives could result in increased income tax liabilities that cannot be predicted at this time.61Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsProjected Benefit Obligations Calculation of the projected benefit obligations for our defined benefit pension and postretirement plans impacts the obligations on the balance sheet and the amount of benefit expense in the income statement. The actuarial calculation of projected benefit obligations and company contribution requirements involves judgment about uncertain future events, including estimated retirement dates, salary levels at retirement, mortality rates, lump-sum election rates, rates of return on plan assets, future interest rates, future health care cost-trend rates, and rates of utilization of health care services by retirees. We engage outside actuarial firms to assist in the calculation of these projected benefit obligations and company contribution requirements due to the specialized nature of these calculations. Due to differing objectives and requirements between financial accounting rules and the pension plan funding regulations promulgated by governmental agencies, the actuarial methods and assumptions for the two purposes differ in certain important respects. Ultimately, we will be required to fund all promised benefits under pension and postretirement benefit plans not funded by plan assets or investment returns, but the judgmental assumptions used in the actuarial calculations significantly affect periodic financial statements and funding patterns over time. Benefit expense is particularly sensitive to the discount rate and return on plan assets assumptions. A one percentage-point decrease in the discount rate assumption used for the plan obligation would increase annual benefit expense by an estimated $50 million, while a one percentage-point decrease in the return on plan assets assumption would increase annual benefit expense by an estimated $30 million. In determining the discount rate, we use yields on high-quality fixed income investments with payments matched to the estimated distributions of benefits from our plans.In 2018 and 2017, the expected weighted-average long-term rate of return for worldwide pension plan assets was approximately 6 percent, while the actual weighted-average rate of return was a negative 4 percent in 2018 and a positive 15 percent in 2017. For the past ten years, our actual weighted-average rate of return for worldwide pension plan assets was 9 percent.62Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsNEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDSIn February 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-02, “Income Statement—Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income.” This ASU allows for the deferred income tax effects stranded in accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) resulting from the Tax Act enacted in December 2017 to be reclassed from AOCI to retained earnings. This ASU is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. Upon adoption on January 1, 2019, we increased retained earnings by approximately $90 million with the offset to accumulated other comprehensive loss on our consolidated balance sheet.In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, “Financial Instruments—Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.” The new standard amends the impairment model to utilize an expected loss methodology in place of the currently used incurred loss methodology, which may result in earlier recognition of losses. Public business entities should apply the guidance in ASU No. 2016-13 for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption will be permitted for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018. We are evaluating the provisions of ASU No. 2016-13, and currently do not expect our adoption to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842).” The new standard establishes a right-of-use (ROU) model that requires a lessee to record a ROU asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months. Leases will continue to be classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement. Similarly, lessors will be required to classify leases as sales-type, finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of income recognition. Classification for both lessees and lessors will be based on an assessment of whether risks and rewards, as well as substantive control have been transferred through a lease contract. The ASU also requires additional disclosures. Public business entities should apply the guidance in ASU No. 2016-02 for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted. We will adopt ASU No. 2016-02 by recognizing a cumulative-effect adjustment to our opening consolidated balance sheet as of our January 1, 2019, adoption date. As of the adoption date, we expect to recognize ROU assets and operating lease liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet of approximately $1.4 billion. The adoption of this ASU is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated statements of income and cash flows. 63Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsNON-GAAP RECONCILIATIONSRefiningOur realized refining margins measure the difference between a) sales and other operating revenues derived from the sale of petroleum products manufactured at our refineries and b) purchase costs of feedstocks, primarily crude oil, used to produce the petroleum products. The realized refining margins are adjusted to include our proportional share of our joint venture refineries’ realized margins, as well as to exclude those items that are not representative of the underlying operating performance of a period, which we call “special items.” The realized refining margins are converted to a per-barrel basis by dividing them by total refinery processed inputs (primarily crude oil) measured on a barrel basis, including our share of inputs processed by our joint venture refineries. Our realized refining margin per barrel is intended to be comparable with industry refining margins, which are known as “crack spreads.” As discussed in “Business Environment,” industry crack spreads measure the difference between market prices for refined petroleum products and crude oil. We believe realized refining margin per barrel calculated on a similar basis as industry crack spreads provides a useful measure of how well we performed relative to benchmark industry margins.The GAAP performance measure most directly comparable to realized refining margin per barrel is the Refining segment’s “income before income taxes per barrel.” Realized refining margin per barrel excludes items that are typically included in a manufacturer’s gross margin, such as depreciation and operating expenses, and other items used to determine income before income taxes, such as general and administrative expenses. It also includes our proportional share of joint venture refineries’ realized refining margins and excludes special items. Because realized refining margin per barrel is calculated in this manner, and because realized refining margin per barrel may be defined differently by other companies in our industry, it has limitations as an analytical tool.

The realized marketing fuel margins are adjusted to exclude those items that are not representative of the underlying operating performance of a period, which we call “special items.” The realized marketing fuel margins are converted to a per-barrel basis by dividing them by sales volumes measured on a barrel basis. We believe realized marketing fuel margin per barrel demonstrates the value uplift our marketing operations provide by optimizing the placement and ultimate sale of our refineries’ fuel production. Within the M&S segment, the GAAP performance measure most directly comparable to realized marketing fuel margin per barrel is the marketing business’ “income before income taxes per barrel.” Realized marketing fuel margin per barrel excludes items that are typically included in gross margin, such as depreciation and operating expenses, and other items used to determine income before income taxes, such as general and administrative expenses.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKFinancial Instrument Market RiskWe and certain of our subsidiaries hold and issue derivative contracts and financial instruments that expose our cash flows or earnings to changes in commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates. We may use financial- and commodity-based derivative contracts to manage the risks produced by changes in the prices of crude oil and related products, natural gas, NGL, and electric power; fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates; or to capture market opportunities.Our use of derivative instruments is governed by an “Authority Limitations” document approved by our Board of Directors, that prohibits the use of highly leveraged derivatives or derivative instruments without sufficient market liquidity for comparable valuations. The Authority Limitations document also establishes Value at Risk (VaR) limits, and compliance with these limits is monitored daily. Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer monitor risks resulting from foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices.Commodity Price RiskWe sell into and receive supply from the worldwide crude oil, refined petroleum product, natural gas, NGL, and electric power markets, exposing our revenues, purchases, cost of operating activities, and cash flows to fluctuations in the prices for these commodities. Generally, our policy is to remain exposed to the market prices of commodities. Consistent with this policy, our Commercial organization uses derivative contracts to convert our exposure from fixed-price sales contracts, often specified in contracts with refined petroleum product customers, back to fluctuating market prices. Conversely, our Commercial organization also uses futures, forwards, swaps and options in various markets to accomplish the following objectives to optimize the value of our supply chain, and this may reduce our exposure to fluctuations in market prices:•Balance physical systems or to meet our refinery requirements and marketing demand. In addition to cash settlement prior to contract expiration, exchange-traded futures contracts may be settled by physical delivery of the commodity.•Manage the risk to our cash flows from price exposures on specific crude oil, refined petroleum product, natural gas, NGL, and electric power transactions.•Enable us to use the market knowledge gained from these activities to capture market opportunities such as moving physical commodities to more profitable locations, storing commodities to capture seasonal or time premiums, and blending commodities to capture quality upgrades. Derivatives may be utilized to optimize these activities.We use a VaR model to estimate the loss in fair value that could potentially result on a single day from the effect of adverse changes in market conditions on the derivative financial instruments and derivative commodity instruments held or issued, including commodity purchase and sales contracts recorded on the balance sheet at December 31, 2018, as derivative instruments. Using the Monte Carlo simulation, a 95 percent confidence level and a one-day holding period, the VaR for those instruments issued or held for trading purposes at December 31, 2018 and 2017, was immaterial to our cash flows and net income. The VaR for instruments held for purposes other than trading at December 31, 2018 and 2017, was also immaterial to our cash flows and net income.68Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsInterest Rate RiskOur use of fixed- or variable-rate debt directly exposes us to interest rate risk. Fixed-rate debt, such as our senior notes, exposes us to changes in the fair value of our debt due to changes in market interest rates. Fixed-rate debt also exposes us to the risk that we may need to refinance maturing debt with new debt at higher rates, or that we may be obligated to pay rates higher than the current market. Variable-rate debt, such as our floating-rate notes or borrowings under our revolving credit facility, exposes us to short-term changes in market rates that impact our interest expense. The following tables provide information about our debt instruments that are sensitive to changes in U.S. interest rates. These tables present principal cash flows and related weighted-average interest rates by expected maturity dates. Weighted-average variable rates are based on effective rates at the reporting date. The carrying amount of our floating-rate debt approximates its fair value. The fair value of the fixed-rate financial instruments is estimated based on observable market prices.

EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW AND BUSINESS ENVIRONMENTPhillips 66 is an energy manufacturing and logistics company with midstream, chemicals, refining, and marketing and specialties businesses. At December 31, 2019, we had total assets of $58.7 billion.Executive OverviewIn 2019, we reported earnings of $3.1 billion and generated $4.8 billion in cash from operating activities. In addition, Phillips 66 Partners LP (Phillips 66 Partners) had net debt issuances of $0.5 billion and received $0.4 billion from its joint venture partners to partially fund the Gray Oak Pipeline capital project. We used available cash primarily for capital expenditures and investments of $3.9 billion, repurchases of our common stock of $1.7 billion, and dividend payments on our common stock of $1.6 billion. We ended 2019 with $1.6 billion of cash and cash equivalents and approximately $5.7 billion of total committed capacity available under our credit facilities.We continue to focus on the following strategic priorities:•Operating Excellence. Our commitment to operating excellence guides everything we do. We are committed to protecting the health and safety of everyone who has a role in our operations and the communities in which we operate. Continuous improvement in safety, environmental stewardship, reliability and cost efficiency is a fundamental requirement for our company and employees. We employ rigorous training and audit programs to drive ongoing improvement in both personal and process safety as we strive for zero incidents. Since we cannot control commodity prices, controlling operating expenses and overhead costs, within the context of our commitment to safety and environmental stewardship, is a high priority. Senior management actively monitors these costs. We are committed to protecting the environment and strive to reduce our environmental footprint throughout our operations. Optimizing utilization rates at our refineries through reliable and safe operations enables us to capture the value available in the market in terms of prices and margins. During 2019, our worldwide refining crude oil capacity utilization rate was 94%. 33Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements•Growth. A disciplined capital allocation process ensures we focus investments on projects that generate competitive returns through the business cycle. Our strategy focuses on investing in growth opportunities in the Midstream and Chemicals segments. Results from our Transportation and NGL businesses in our Midstream segment for 2019 were a reflection of this, as these businesses benefited from higher equity earnings and cash distributions from completed capital projects. In 2020, we have budgeted $2.4 billion for Midstream capital expenditures and investments, including $962 million for Phillips 66 Partners. Capital will be used to continue building out and maintaining our integrated logistics infrastructure network, including pipelines, storage, export and fractionation facilities. In Chemicals, our share of expected self-funded capital spending by Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC (CPChem) is $656 million. CPChem will fund continuing development of petrochemical projects on the U.S. Gulf Coast (USGC) and in Qatar, as well as debottlenecking opportunities on existing assets. •Returns. We plan to enhance Refining returns by increasing throughput of advantaged feedstocks, improving yields, portfolio optimization and an ongoing commitment to operating excellence. Our Refining segment maintained a strong clean product yield and optimized advantaged crude oil throughput at our U.S. refineries in 2019. For 2020, capital in Refining will be directed toward high-return projects to enhance the yield of higher-value products and other high-return, quick-payout projects. Marketing and Specialties (M&S) will continue to develop and enhance our retail network and brands in the United States and Europe. •Distributions. We believe shareholder value is enhanced through, among other things, consistent growth of regular dividends, complemented by share repurchases. We increased our quarterly dividend rate by 13% during 2019, and have increased it every year since the company’s inception in 2012. Regular dividends demonstrate the confidence our Board of Directors and management have in our capital structure and operations’ capability to generate free cash flow throughout the business cycle. In 2019, we repurchased $1.7 billion, or approximately 17 million shares, of our common stock. On October 4, 2019, our Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase program that authorizes us to repurchase up to $3 billion of our common stock, bringing the total amount of share repurchases authorized by our Board of Directors since July 2012 to an aggregate of $15 billion. At the discretion of our Board of Directors, we plan to increase dividends annually and fund our share repurchase programs while continuing to invest in the growth of our business. •High-Performing Organization. We strive to attract, develop and retain individuals with the knowledge and skills to implement our business strategy and who support our values and culture. Throughout the company, we focus on getting results in the right way, embrace our values as a common bond, and believe success is both what we do and how we do it. We encourage collaboration throughout our company, while valuing differences, respecting diversity, and creating a great place to work. We foster an environment of learning and development through structured programs focused on enhancing functional and technical skills where employees are engaged in our business and committed to their own, as well as the company’s, success.34Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsBusiness EnvironmentThe Midstream segment includes our Transportation and Natural Gas Liquids (NGL) businesses. Our Transportation business contains fee-based operations that are not directly exposed to commodity price risk. Our NGL business is directly linked to NGL prices. The Midstream segment also includes our 50% equity investment in DCP Midstream, LLC (DCP Midstream). NGL prices were significantly lower in 2019, compared with 2018, due to higher inventory levels resulting from supply growth and weak winter demand. The Chemicals segment consists of our 50% equity investment in CPChem. The chemicals and plastics industry is mainly a commodity-based industry where the margins for key products are based on supply and demand, as well as cost factors. During 2019, the benchmark high-density polyethylene chain margin further decreased, compared with 2018, due to recent capacity additions, the continued trade policy uncertainty and slower demand growth in Asia.Our Refining segment results are driven by several factors, including refining margins, refinery throughput, feedstock costs, product yields, turnaround activity, and other operating costs. The price of U.S. benchmark crude oil, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) at Cushing, Oklahoma, decreased to an average of $57.02 per barrel during 2019, compared with an average of $64.92 per barrel in 2018, due to continued growth in Permian Basin production and higher inventories as exports failed to keep pace with production growth. In addition, heavy Canadian crude differentials narrowed in 2019, compared with 2018, due primarily to production curtailments implemented by the Alberta Provincial government. Market crack spreads are used as indicators of refining margins and measure the difference between market prices for refined petroleum products and crude oil. During 2019, the market crack spreads slightly decreased in the Atlantic Basin/Europe, Gulf Coast and Central Corridor regions, but increased in the West Coast region, compared with 2018.Results for our M&S segment depend largely on marketing fuel margins, lubricant margins, and other specialty product margins. While M&S margins are primarily driven by market factors, largely determined by the relationship between supply and demand, marketing fuel margins, in particular, are influenced by the trend in spot prices for refined petroleum products. Generally speaking, a downward trend of spot prices has a favorable impact on marketing fuel margins, while an upward trend of spot prices has an unfavorable impact on marketing fuel margins.35Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsRESULTS OF OPERATIONSConsolidated ResultsA summary of income (loss) before income taxes by business segment with a reconciliation to net income attributable to Phillips 66 follows: Millions of Dollars Year Ended December 31 2019 2018 2017 Midstream$684 1,181 638Chemicals879 1,025 716Refining1,986 4,535 2,076Marketing and Specialties1,433 1,557 1,020Corporate and Other(804) (853) (895)Income before income taxes4,178 7,445 3,555Income tax expense (benefit)801 1,572 (1,693)Net income3,377 5,873 5,248Less: net income attributable to noncontrolling interests301 278 142Net income attributable to Phillips 66$3,076 5,595 5,1062019 vs. 2018 Our earnings decreased $2,519 million, or 45%, in 2019, mainly reflecting: •Lower realized refining and marketing margins.•Impairments associated with our investment in DCP Midstream.•Decreased equity in earnings of affiliates in our Refining and Chemicals segments.These decreases were partially offset by:•Lower income tax expense.•Improved results from our NGL and transportation businesses.36Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements2018 vs. 2017 Our earnings increased $489 million, or 10%, in 2018, mainly reflecting: •Higher realized refining and marketing margins.•Higher equity in earnings of affiliates in our Midstream and Chemicals segments.•A lower U.S. federal income tax rate beginning January 1, 2018, as a result of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act) enacted in December 2017. These increases were partially offset by:•A $2,735 million provisional income tax benefit from the enactment of the Tax Act recognized in December 2017, primarily due to the revaluation of deferred income taxes.•A $261 million noncash, after-tax gain from the consolidation of Merey Sweeny, L.P., predecessor to Merey Sweeny LLC (both referred to herein as Merey Sweeny), in 2017.•Higher net income attributable to noncontrolling interests primarily due to the contribution of assets to Phillips 66 Partners in the fourth quarter of 2017.•Higher interest and debt expense.See the “Segment Results” section for additional information on our segment results.37Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsStatement of Income Analysis2019 vs. 2018 Sales and other operating revenues and purchased crude oil and products decreased 4% and 2%, respectively, in 2019. The decreases were mainly driven by lower prices for refined petroleum products, crude oil and NGL. Equity in earnings of affiliates decreased 21% in 2019. The decrease was mainly due to lower margins at WRB Refining LP (WRB) and CPChem, partially offset by improved results from our Transportation and NGL joint venture assets. Lower equity earnings in 2019 also reflected lower-of-cost-or-market inventory write-downs at CPChem and higher goodwill and other asset impairments at DCP Midstream. See the “Segment Results” section for additional information.Other income increased $58 million in 2019. The increase was mainly driven by trading activities not directly related to our physical business. See Note 15—Derivatives and Financial Instruments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information associated with our commodity derivatives. Impairments increased $853 million in 2019. The increase was driven by an $853 million pre-tax impairment associated with our investment in DCP Midstream recognized in the third quarter of 2019. See Note 7—Investments, Loans and Long-Term Receivables, and Note 16—Fair Value Measurements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information associated with this impairment.Interest and debt expense decreased 9% in 2019. The decrease was primarily attributable to higher capitalized interest associated with capital projects under development in our Midstream segment, partially offset by higher debt balances in 2019.Income tax expense (benefit) decreased 49% in 2019. The decrease in income tax expense was primarily attributable to lower income before income taxes. See Note 21—Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for more information regarding our income taxes.38Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements2018 vs. 2017 Sales and other operating revenues and purchased crude oil and products increased 9% and 23%, respectively, in 2018. The increases were mainly due to higher prices for refined petroleum products, crude oil and NGL. The increase in sales and other operating revenues was partially offset by a change in the presentation of excise taxes on sales of refined petroleum products resulting from our adoption of Financial Accounting Standard Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606),” on January 1, 2018. As part of our adoption of this ASU, prospectively from January 1, 2018, our presentation of excise taxes on sales of refined petroleum products changed to a net basis from a gross basis. As a result, the “Sales and other operating revenues” and “Taxes other than income taxes” line items on our consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2018, are not presented on a comparable basis to the year ended December 31, 2017. See Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for further information on our presentation of excise taxes on sales of refined petroleum products and our adoption of this ASU, respectively. Equity in earnings of affiliates increased 55% in 2018, primarily resulting from higher equity in earnings from WRB, CPChem and affiliates in our Midstream segment. •Equity in earnings of WRB increased $483 million, primarily due to higher realized margins driven by improved feedstock advantage.•Equity in earnings of CPChem increased $312 million, primarily due to commencement of full operations at CPChem’s new U.S. Gulf Coast petrochemicals assets and lower hurricane-related costs and downtime in 2018.•Equity in earnings for our Midstream segment increased $222 million, primarily due to higher volumes on affiliate pipelines, including the Bakken Pipeline, which operated for a full year in 2018.Other income decreased $460 million in 2018. We recognized a noncash, pre-tax gain of $423 million in February 2017 related to the consolidation of Merey Sweeny. See Note 6—Business Combinations, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. Taxes other than income taxes decreased 97% in 2018. The decrease was primarily attributable to the change in our presentation of excise taxes on sales of refined petroleum products resulting from our adoption of ASU No. 2014-09 on January 1, 2018. See the “Sales and other operating revenues” section above for further discussion.Interest and debt expense increased 15% in 2018. The increase was due to higher average debt principal balances resulting from our issuance of senior notes totaling $1,500 million in March 2018 and Phillips 66 Partners’ issuance of senior notes totaling $650 million in October 2017.Income tax expense (benefit) was an expense in 2018, compared with a benefit in 2017. The benefit in 2017 was due to the recognition of a provisional income tax benefit of $2,735 million from the enactment of the Tax Act in December 2017. The benefit from the Tax Act was primarily due to the revaluation of deferred income taxes. Excluding this benefit, income tax expense increased in 2018 due to higher income before income taxes, partially offset by the reduction of the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% beginning January 1, 2018, as a result of the Tax Act. See Note 21—Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for more information regarding our income taxes.Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests increased $136 million in 2018, primarily due to the contribution of assets in the fourth quarter of 2017. In October 2017, we contributed to Phillips 66 Partners our 25% ownership interest in both Dakota Access, LLC (Dakota Access) and Energy Transfer Crude Oil Company, LLC (ETCO), and our 100% ownership interest in Merey Sweeny.39Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsSegment ResultsMidstream Year Ended December 31 2019 2018 2017 Millions of DollarsIncome (Loss) Before Income Taxes Transportation$946 770 530NGL and Other522 305 32DCP Midstream(784) 106 76Total Midstream$684 1,181 638 Thousands of Barrels DailyTransportation Volumes Pipelines*3,396 3,441 3,320Terminals3,315 3,153 2,665Operating Statistics NGL fractionated**224 216 186NGL extracted***417 413 374* Pipelines represent the sum of volumes transported through each separately tariffed consolidated pipeline segment. ** Excludes DCP Midstream.*** Includes 100% of DCP Midstream’s volumes.

This segment includes our master limited partnership (MLP), Phillips 66 Partners, as well as our 50% equity investment in DCP Midstream, which includes the operations of its MLP, DCP Midstream, LP (DCP Partners).2019 vs. 2018 Pre-tax income from the Midstream segment decreased $497 million in 2019, compared with 2018, mainly driven by an $853 million pre-tax impairment associated with our investment in DCP Midstream and lower equity earnings from DCP Midstream, partially offset by improved results from our Transportation and NGL and Other businesses. Pre-tax income from our Transportation business increased $176 million in 2019, compared with 2018. The increase was mainly driven by higher volumes and pipeline tariffs from our portfolio of consolidated and joint venture assets.Pre-tax income from our NGL and Other business increased $217 million in 2019, compared with 2018. The increase was mainly due to improved margins and volumes, primarily at the Sweeny Hub, and higher equity earnings from certain pipeline affiliates driven by higher volumes.40Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsPre-tax income from our investment in DCP Midstream decreased $890 million in 2019, compared with 2018. The decrease was primarily due to an $853 million pre-tax impairment associated with our investment in DCP Midstream and lower equity earnings driven by higher goodwill and other asset impairments at DCP Partners in 2019 as described below.In the third quarter of 2019, DCP Partners performed goodwill and other asset impairment assessments based on internal discounted cash flow models that reflected various observable and nonobservable factors, such as prices, volumes, expenses and discount rates. As a result of these assessments, DCP Partners recorded goodwill and other asset impairments that reduced our equity earnings by $47 million, included in the “Equity in earnings of affiliates” line item on our consolidated statement of income.The fair value of our investment in DCP Midstream at September 30, 2019, depended on the market value of DCP Midstream’s general partner interest in DCP Partners and the market value of DCP Partners’ common units. At June 30, 2019, we estimated the fair value of our investment in DCP Midstream was below our book value, but we believed the condition was temporary. The fair value of our investment in DCP Midstream further deteriorated in the third quarter as the market value of DCP Midstream’s general partner interest in DCP Partners and the market value of DCP Partners’ common units declined further. At that time, we concluded the decline in fair value was no longer temporary due to the duration and magnitude of the decline. Accordingly, we recorded an $853 million impairment in the third quarter of 2019. The impairment is included in the “Impairments” line item on our consolidated statement of income and results in our investment in DCP Midstream having a book value of $1,374 million at December 31, 2019. The majority of the difference between the book value of our investment in DCP Midstream and our 50% share of the net assets reported by DCP Midstream is amortized over a 22-year estimated useful life as an annual increase of approximately $40 million to equity earnings. See Note 7—Investments, Loans and Long-Term Receivables, and Note 16—Fair Value Measurements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information on our investment in DCP Midstream.See the “Executive Overview and Business Environment” section for information on market factors impacting 2019 results.2018 vs. 2017 Pre-tax income from the Midstream segment increased $543 million in 2018, compared with 2017, due to improved results across all business lines. Pre-tax income from our Transportation business increased $240 million in 2018, compared with 2017. The increase was mainly driven by higher volumes, tariffs and storage rates from our portfolio of consolidated and joint venture assets. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in equity earnings from Rockies Express Pipeline LLC (REX) due to a favorable settlement recorded in 2017.Pre-tax income from our NGL and Other business increased $273 million in 2018, compared with 2017. The increase was primarily due to the contribution of Merey Sweeny to Phillips 66 Partners in October 2017, inventory impacts, improved cargo margins and volumes, and higher equity earnings from pipeline affiliates due to increased volumes.Pre-tax income from our investment in DCP Midstream increased $30 million in 2018, compared with 2017. The increase was primarily due to higher equity earnings from affiliates as a result of increased volumes, timing of incentive distribution income allocations from DCP Partners, and favorable hedging results. These increases were partially offset by higher asset impairments and operating costs in 2018. 41Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsChemicals Year Ended December 31 2019 2018 2017 Millions of Dollars Income Before Income Taxes$879 1,025 716 Millions of PoundsCPChem Externally Marketed Sales Volumes* Olefins and Polyolefins18,788 18,435 15,870Specialties, Aromatics and Styrenics4,281 4,931 4,618 23,069 23,366 20,488* Represents 100% of CPChem’s outside sales of produced petrochemical products, as well as commission sales from equity affiliates. Olefins and Polyolefins Capacity Utilization (percent)97% 94 87The Chemicals segment consists of our 50% interest in CPChem, which we account for under the equity method. CPChem uses NGL and other feedstocks to produce petrochemicals. These products are then marketed and sold or used as feedstocks to produce plastics and other chemicals. We structure our reporting of CPChem’s operations around two primary business lines: Olefins and Polyolefins (O&P) and Specialties, Aromatics and Styrenics (SA&S). The O&P business line produces and markets ethylene and other olefin products. Ethylene produced is primarily consumed within CPChem for the production of polyethylene, normal alpha olefins and polyethylene pipe. The SA&S business line manufactures and markets aromatics and styrenics products, such as benzene, cyclohexane, styrene and polystyrene. SA&S also manufactures and/or markets a variety of specialty chemical products. Unless otherwise noted, amounts referenced below reflect our net 50% interest in CPChem.2019 vs. 2018 Pre-tax income from the Chemicals segment decreased $146 million in 2019, compared with 2018. The decrease was mainly due to lower polyethylene margins attributable to additional industry capacity and slower demand growth in Asia. In addition, CPChem recorded lower-of-cost-or-market write-downs of LIFO-valued inventories during 2019, and our portion of the write-downs reduced our equity earnings from CPChem by $65 million, pre-tax. The decreases were partially offset by higher polyethylene sales volumes and lower turnaround and maintenance activity during 2019.See the “Executive Overview and Business Environment” section for information on market factors impacting CPChem’s 2019 results.2018 vs. 2017 Pre-tax income from the Chemicals segment increased $309 million in 2018, compared with 2017. The increased results reflected the commencement of full operations at CPChem’s new U.S. Gulf Coast petrochemicals assets in the second quarter of 2018, which resulted in higher production and sales of polyethylene and ethylene, partially offset by lower capitalized interest. Additionally, lower hurricane-related costs and downtime, as well as lower impairment charges, contributed to the increased results in 2018.42Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsRefining Year Ended December 31 2019 2018 2017 Millions of DollarsIncome (Loss) Before Income Taxes Atlantic Basin/Europe$608 567 448Gulf Coast364 1,040 809Central Corridor1,338 2,817 755West Coast(324) 111 64Worldwide$1,986 4,535 2,076 Dollars Per BarrelIncome (Loss) Before Income Taxes Atlantic Basin/Europe$3.11 3.05 2.25Gulf Coast1.24 3.55 2.83Central Corridor12.95 26.50 8.19West Coast(2.49) 0.81 0.48Worldwide2.75 6.29 2.92 Realized Refining Margins* Atlantic Basin/Europe$9.33 10.32 8.25Gulf Coast7.42 9.48 7.07Central Corridor14.91 22.22 12.44West Coast9.18 11.20 10.49Worldwide9.91 12.99 9.13* See the “Non-GAAP Reconciliations” section for a reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, income (loss) before income taxes per barrel.43Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements Thousands of Barrels Daily Year Ended December 31 2019 2018 2017Operating Statistics Refining operations* Atlantic Basin/Europe Crude oil capacity537 537 520Crude oil processed497 477 494Capacity utilization (percent)92% 89 95Refinery production541 514 553Gulf Coast Crude oil capacity764 752 743Crude oil processed725 717 709Capacity utilization (percent)95% 95 95Refinery production804 808 789Central Corridor Crude oil capacity515 493 493Crude oil processed498 507 467Capacity utilization (percent)97% 103 95Refinery production518 530 489West Coast Crude oil capacity364 364 360Crude oil processed323 343 342Capacity utilization (percent)89% 94 95Refinery production354 373 368Worldwide Crude oil capacity2,180 2,146 2,116Crude oil processed2,043 2,044 2,012Capacity utilization (percent)94% 95 95Refinery production2,217 2,225 2,199* Includes our share of equity affiliates. The Refining segment refines crude oil and other feedstocks into petroleum products, such as gasoline, distillates and aviation fuels, at 13 refineries in the United States and Europe. 2019 vs. 2018 Pre-tax income for the Refining segment decreased $2,549 million in 2019, compared with 2018. The decrease was primarily driven by lower realized refining margins and lower refinery production at certain refineries due to turnaround activities and unplanned downtime. In 2019, the decrease in realized refining margins was primarily due to lower feedstock advantage driven by narrowing heavy crude differentials.See the “Executive Overview and Business Environment” section for information on industry crack spreads and other market factors impacting this year’s results.Our worldwide refining crude oil capacity utilization rate was 94% and 95% in 2019 and 2018, respectively. 44Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements2018 vs. 2017 Pre-tax income for the Refining segment increased $2,459 million in 2018, compared with 2017. The increase was primarily due to higher realized refining margins, partially offset by a noncash gain of $423 million recognized from the consolidation of Merey Sweeny in February 2017.The increased realized refining margins were primarily driven by higher feedstock advantage, improved premium coke margins, and increased optimization benefits from using our integrated logistics network to capture market opportunities related to widening Bakken, Canadian and other inland crude differentials. Improved clean product differentials and lower renewable identification number (RIN) costs also benefited margins. These items were partially offset by a decline in market crack spreads. Our worldwide refining crude oil capacity utilization rate was 95% in both 2018 and 2017. 45Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsMarketing and Specialties Year Ended December 31 2019 2018 2017 Millions of DollarsIncome Before Income Taxes Marketing and Other$1,199 1,306 808Specialties234 251 212Total Marketing and Specialties$1,433 1,557 1,020 Dollars Per BarrelIncome Before Income Taxes U.S.$1.22 1.21 0.89International3.58 5.00 2.23 Realized Marketing Fuel Margins* U.S.$1.57 1.62 1.48International4.90 6.87 4.21* See the “Non-GAAP Reconciliations” section for a reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, income before income taxes per barrel.

Corporate overhead and other includes general and administrative expenses, technology costs, environmental costs associated with sites no longer in operation, foreign currency transaction gains and losses and other costs not directly associated with an operating segment. During 2019, Corporate overhead and other decreased $5 million, compared with 2018. 2018 vs. 2017 Net interest expense increased $51 million in 2018, compared with 2017, mainly due to higher average debt principal balances from our issuance of senior notes totaling $1,500 million in March 2018 and Phillips 66 Partners’ issuance of senior notes totaling $650 million in October 2017. This increase was partially offset by higher interest income.Corporate overhead and other decreased $93 million in 2018, compared with 2017, primarily due to lower environmental-related expenses and higher equity earnings from our share of income tax benefits recorded by equity affiliates due to the enactment of the Tax Act in December 2017.47Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsCAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITYFinancial Indicators Millions of Dollars, Except as Indicated 2019 2018 2017 Cash and cash equivalents$1,614 3,019 3,119Net cash provided by operating activities4,808 7,573 3,648Short-term debt547 67 41Total debt11,763 11,160 10,110Total equity27,169 27,153 27,428Percent of total debt to capital*30% 29 27Percent of floating-rate debt to total debt9% 11 11* Capital includes total debt and total equity.To meet our short- and long-term liquidity requirements, we look to a variety of funding sources but rely primarily on cash generated from operating activities.

We used available cash primarily for capital expenditures and investments of $3.9 billion; repurchases of our common stock of $1.7 billion; and dividend payments on our common stock of $1.6 billion. During 2019, cash and cash equivalents decreased $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion.In addition to cash flows from operating activities, we rely on our commercial paper and credit facility programs, asset sales and our ability to issue debt securities to support our short- and long-term liquidity requirements. We believe current cash and cash equivalents and cash generated by operations, together with access to external sources of funds as described below under “Significant Sources of Capital,” will be sufficient to meet our funding requirements in the near and long term, including our capital spending, dividend payments, defined benefit plan contributions, debt repayments and share repurchases. Significant Sources of CapitalOperating ActivitiesDuring 2019, cash generated by operating activities was $4,808 million, a 37% decrease compared with 2018. The decrease was mainly driven by lower realized refining margins and decreased distributions from our equity affiliates, along with unfavorable working capital impacts, partially offset by improved results from our Transportation and NGL and Other businesses. During 2018, cash of $7,573 million was provided by operating activities, a 108% increase compared with 2017. The increase was primarily attributable to higher realized refining and marketing margins, increased distributions from our equity affiliates and lower employee benefit plan contributions. These increases were partially offset by unfavorable working capital impacts primarily driven by the effects of changes in commodity prices and the timing of payments and collections. Our short- and long-term operating cash flows are highly dependent upon refining and marketing margins, NGL prices and chemicals margins. Prices and margins in our industry are typically volatile, and are driven by market conditions over which we have little or no control. Absent other mitigating factors, as these prices and margins fluctuate, we would expect a corresponding change in our operating cash flows.48Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsThe level and quality of output from our refineries also impacts our cash flows. Factors such as operating efficiency, maintenance turnarounds, market conditions, feedstock availability and weather conditions can affect output. We actively manage the operations of our refineries, and any variability in their operations typically has not been as significant to cash flows as that caused by margins and prices. Our worldwide refining crude oil capacity utilization was 94% in 2019 and 95% in both 2018 and 2017.Equity Affiliate Operating DistributionsOur operating cash flows are also impacted by distribution decisions made by our equity affiliates, including CPChem, DCP Midstream and WRB. Over the three years ended December 31, 2019, we received aggregate distributions from our equity affiliates of $6,097 million, including $280 million from DCP Midstream, $2,187 million from CPChem and $1,380 million from WRB. We cannot control the amount or timing of future dividends from equity affiliates; therefore, future dividend payments by these and other equity affiliates are not assured.Phillips 66 PartnersIn 2013, we formed Phillips 66 Partners, a publicly traded MLP, to own, operate, develop and acquire primarily fee-based midstream assets.Ownership and Restructuring TransactionOn August 1, 2019, Phillips 66 Partners completed a restructuring transaction to eliminate the incentive distribution rights (IDRs) held by us and to convert our 2% economic general partner interest into a noneconomic general partner interest in exchange for 101 million Phillips 66 Partners common units. No distributions were made for the general partner interest after August 1, 2019. At December 31, 2019, we owned 170 million Phillips 66 Partners common units, representing 74% of Phillips 66 Partners’ limited partner units. We consolidate Phillips 66 Partners as a variable interest entity for financial reporting purposes. See Note 27—Phillips 66 Partners LP, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information on why we consolidate the partnership. As a result of this consolidation, the public common and preferred unitholders’ interests in Phillips 66 Partners are reflected as noncontrolling interests of $2,228 million in our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2019. Debt and Equity FinancingsDuring the three years ended December 31, 2019, Phillips 66 Partners raised net proceeds of approximately $3 billion from the following third-party debt and equity offerings:•Phillips 66 Partners has authorized an aggregate of $750 million under three $250 million continuous offerings of common units, or at-the-market (ATM) programs. Phillips 66 Partners completed the first two programs in June 2018 and December 2019, respectively, leaving $250 million available under the third program. For the three years ended December 31, 2019, net proceeds of $474 million have been received under these programs.•In September 2019, Phillips 66 Partners received net proceeds of $892 million from the issuance of $300 million of 2.450% Senior Notes due December 2024 and $600 million of 3.150% Senior Notes due December 2029.•In March 2019, Phillips 66 Partners entered into a senior unsecured term loan facility with a borrowing capacity of $400 million due March 20, 2020. Phillips 66 Partners borrowed an aggregate amount of $400 million under the facility during the first half of 2019, which was repaid in full in September 2019. •In October 2017, Phillips 66 Partners received net proceeds of $643 million from the issuance of $500 million of 3.750% Senior Notes due March 2028 and $150 million of 4.680% Senior Notes due February 2045.•In October 2017, Phillips 66 Partners received net proceeds of $737 million from a private placement of 13,819,791 perpetual convertible preferred units, at a price of $54.27 per unit.•In October 2017, Phillips 66 Partners received net proceeds of $295 million from a private placement of 6,304,204 common units, at a price of $47.59 per unit.49Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsPhillips 66 Partners primarily used these net proceeds to fund the cash portion of acquisitions of assets from Phillips 66 and for capital spending and investments. See Note 27—Phillips 66 Partners LP, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information on Phillips 66 Partners.Transfers of Equity InterestsIn December 2018, a third party exercised an option to acquire a 35% interest in Gray Oak Holdings LLC (Holdings LLC), a consolidated subsidiary of Phillips 66 Partners. This transfer did not qualify as a sale under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP) because of certain restrictions placed on the acquirer. The contributions received by Holdings LLC from the third party to cover capital calls from Gray Oak Pipeline, LLC are presented as a long-term obligation on our consolidated balance sheet and as financing cash inflows on our consolidated statement of cash flows until construction of the Gray Oak Pipeline is fully completed and these restrictions expire. During 2019, the third party contributed an aggregate of $342 million into Holdings LLC, and Holdings LLC used these contributions to fund its portion of Gray Oak Pipeline, LLC’s cash calls. In February 2019, Holdings LLC sold a 10% ownership interest in Gray Oak Pipeline, LLC to a third party that exercised a purchase option, for proceeds of $81 million. The proceeds received from this sale are presented as an investing cash inflow on our consolidated statement of cash flows. See Note 7—Investments, Loans and Long-Term Receivables and Note 27—Phillips 66 Partners LP, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information regarding Phillip 66 Partners’ investment in Gray Oak Pipeline, LLC.Credit Facilities and Commercial PaperPhillips 66 has a revolving credit facility that may be used for direct bank borrowings, as support for issuances of letters of credit, or as support for our commercial paper program. On July 30, 2019, this revolving credit agreement was amended and restated to extend the scheduled maturity from October 3, 2021, to July 30, 2024. No other material amendments were made to the agreement, and the overall capacity remains at $5 billion with an option to increase the overall capacity to $6 billion, subject to certain conditions. The facility is with a broad syndicate of financial institutions and contains covenants that are usual and customary for an agreement of this type for comparable commercial borrowers, including a maximum consolidated net debt-to-capitalization ratio of 65%. The agreement has customary events of default, such as nonpayment of principal when due; nonpayment of interest, fees or other amounts; violation of covenants; cross-payment default and cross-acceleration (in each case, to indebtedness in excess of a threshold amount); and a change of control. Borrowings under the facility will incur interest at the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a margin based on the credit rating of our senior unsecured long-term debt as determined from time to time by Standard & Poor’s Financial Services LLC (S&P) and Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. (Moody’s). The facility also provides for customary fees, including administrative agent fees and commitment fees. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, no amount had been drawn under this revolving credit agreement. Phillips 66 has a $5 billion commercial paper program for short-term working capital needs that is supported by our revolving credit facility. Commercial paper maturities are generally limited to 90 days. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, no borrowings were outstanding under the commercial paper program. At February 21, 2020, there was approximately $650 million in borrowings outstanding under the program.50Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsPhillips 66 Partners has a revolving credit facility with a broad syndicate of financial institutions. The revolving credit facility contains covenants that are usual and customary for an agreement of this type for comparable commercial borrowers. At Phillips 66 Partners’ option, outstanding borrowings under this facility bear interest at either i) the Eurodollar rate plus a margin based on its credit rating; or ii) the base rate (as described in the facility agreement) plus a margin based on its credit rating. Eurodollar rate borrowings are due on the facility’s termination date, while base rate borrowings are due the earlier of the facility’s termination date or the fourteenth business day after such borrowings were made. On July 30, 2019, Phillips 66 Partners amended and restated its revolving credit agreement. The agreement extended the scheduled maturity from October 3, 2021, to July 30, 2024. No other material amendments were made to the agreement, and the overall capacity remains at $750 million with an option to increase the overall capacity to $1 billion, subject to certain conditions. At December 31, 2019, Phillips 66 Partners had no borrowings outstanding under this facility; however, $1 million in letters of credit had been issued that were supported by this facility. There was $125 million outstanding under this facility at December 31, 2018.We had approximately $5.7 billion and $5.6 billion of total committed capacity available under our revolving credit facilities at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Other Debt Issuances and FinancingsOn March 1, 2018, Phillips 66 closed on a public offering of $1,500 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured notes consisting of:•$500 million of floating-rate Senior Notes due February 2021. Interest on these notes is equal to the three-month LIBOR plus 0.60% per annum and is payable quarterly in arrears on February 26, May 26, August 26 and November 26, beginning on May 29, 2018. •$800 million of 3.900% Senior Notes due March 2028. Interest on these notes is payable semiannually on March 15 and September 15 of each year, beginning on September 15, 2018.•An additional $200 million of our 4.875% Senior Notes due November 2044. Interest on these notes is payable semiannually on May 15 and November 15 of each year, beginning on May 15, 2018. Phillips 66 used the net proceeds from the issuance of these notes and cash on hand to repay commercial paper borrowings during the first quarter of 2018, and for general corporate purposes. The commercial paper borrowings during the first quarter of 2018, were primarily used to repurchase shares of our common stock. See Note 17—Equity, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information.In addition, we have finance lease obligations primarily related to consignment agreements with a domestic retail marketing joint venture and an oil terminal in the United Kingdom. These leases mature within the next twenty years. The present value of our minimum finance lease payments for these obligations as of December 31, 2019, was $277 million.Availability of Debt and Equity FinancingOur senior unsecured long-term debt has been rated investment grade by S&P (BBB+) and Moody’s (A3). We do not have any ratings triggers on any of our corporate debt that would cause an automatic default, and thereby impact our access to liquidity, in the event of a downgrade of our credit rating. If our credit rating deteriorated to a level prohibiting us from accessing the commercial paper market, we would expect to be able to access funds under our liquidity facilities mentioned above.51Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsOff-Balance Sheet ArrangementsLease Residual Value GuaranteesUnder the operating lease agreement on our headquarters facility in Houston, Texas, we have a residual value guarantee with a maximum future exposure of $554 million at December 31, 2019. The operating lease term ends in June 2021 and provides us the option, at the end of the lease term, to request to renew the lease, purchase the facility or assist the lessor in marketing it for resale. We also have residual value guarantees associated with railcar and airplane leases with maximum potential future payments totaling $372 million at December 31, 2019. These leases have remaining terms of up to four years.Dakota AccessIn March 2019, a wholly owned subsidiary of Dakota Access closed an offering of $2,500 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes. The net proceeds from the issuance of these notes were used to repay amounts outstanding under existing credit facilities of Dakota Access and ETCO. Dakota Access and ETCO have guaranteed repayment of the notes. In addition, Phillips 66 Partners and its co-venturers in Dakota Access provided a Contingent Equity Contribution Undertaking (CECU) in conjunction with the notes offering. Under the CECU, if Dakota Access receives an unfavorable court ruling related to certain disputed construction permits and Dakota Access determines that an equity contribution trigger event has occurred, the venturers may be severally required to make proportionate equity contributions to Dakota Access and ETCO up to an aggregate maximum of approximately $2,525 million. Phillips 66 Partners’ share of the maximum potential equity contributions under the CECU is approximately $631 million.Gray Oak PipelineIn June 2019, Gray Oak Pipeline, LLC entered into a third-party term loan facility with an initial borrowing capacity of $1,230 million, which was increased to $1,317 million in July 2019, and $1,379 million in January 2020, inclusive of accrued interest. Borrowings under the facility are due on June 3, 2022. Phillips 66 Partners and its co-venturers provided a guarantee through an equity contribution agreement requiring proportionate equity contributions to Gray Oak Pipeline, LLC up to the total outstanding loan amount. Under the agreement, Phillips 66 Partners’ maximum potential amount of future obligations is $583 million, plus any additional accrued interest and associated fees, which would be required if the term loan facility is fully utilized and Gray Oak Pipeline, LLC defaults on certain of its obligations thereunder. At December 31, 2019, Gray Oak Pipeline, LLC had outstanding borrowings of $1,170 million, and Phillips 66 Partners’ 42.25% proportionate exposure under the equity contribution agreement was $494 million. Other GuaranteesAt December 31, 2019, we had other guarantees outstanding for our portion of certain joint venture debt obligations and purchase obligations that have remaining terms of up to six years. The maximum potential amount of future payments to third parties under these guarantees was approximately $263 million. Payment would be required if a joint venture defaults on its obligations. See Note 13—Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information on our guarantees.52Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsCapital RequirementsCapital Expenditures and InvestmentsFor information about our capital expenditures and investments, see the “Capital Spending” section below. Debt FinancingOur debt balance at December 31, 2019, was $11.8 billion and our total debt-to-capital ratio was 30%. See Note 12—Debt, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for our annual debt maturities over the next five years and more information on debt repayments.DividendsOn February 5, 2020, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.90 per common share, payable March 2, 2020, to holders of record at the close of business on February 18, 2020. We forecast that our quarterly dividend will continue to increase in 2020.Share RepurchasesOn October 4, 2019, our Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase program that authorizes us to repurchase up to $3 billion of our common stock, bringing the total amount of share repurchases authorized by our Board of Directors since July 2012 to an aggregate of $15 billion. The authorizations do not have expiration dates. The share repurchases are expected to be funded primarily through available cash. The shares under these authorizations are repurchased from time to time in the open market at our discretion, subject to market conditions and other factors, and in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements. Since the inception of our share repurchase programs in 2012 through December 31, 2019, we have repurchased 154 million shares at an aggregate cost of $12 billion. Shares of stock repurchased are held as treasury shares.Employee Benefit Plan ContributionsFor the year ended December 31, 2019, we contributed $57 million to our U.S. employee benefit plans and $28 million to our international employee benefit plans. In 2020, we expect to contribute approximately $75 million to those plans.53Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsContractual ObligationsThe following table summarizes our aggregate contractual fixed and variable obligations as of December 31, 2019: Millions of Dollars Payments Due by Period Total Up to1 Year Years2-3 Years4-5 After5 Years Debt obligations (a)$11,576 525 2,550 300 8,201Finance lease obligations277 19 30 30 198Software obligations10 3 5 2 —Total debt11,863 547 2,585 332 8,399Interest on debt7,323 497 914 779 5,133Operating lease obligations1,409 488 427 195 299Purchase obligations (b)83,449 40,666 7,519 4,382 30,882Other long-term liabilities (c) Asset retirement obligations280 8 39 25 208Accrued environmental costs441 75 118 68 180Repatriation income tax liability (d)90 1 19 41 29Total$104,855 42,282 11,621 5,822 45,130 (a)For additional information, see Note 12—Debt, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.(b)Represents any agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable, legally binding and specifies all significant terms. We expect these purchase obligations will be fulfilled with operating cash flows in the applicable maturity period. The majority of the purchase obligations are market-based contracts, including exchanges and futures, for the purchase of products such as crude oil and raw NGL. The products are used to supply our refineries and fractionators and optimize our supply chain. Product purchase commitments with third parties totaled $36,271 million. In addition, $21,779 million are product purchases from CPChem, mostly for fuel gas and natural gasoline over the remaining contractual term of 80 years, and product purchases of $3,640 million from DCP Midstream for NGL over the remaining contractual term of nine years. Purchase obligations of $6,187 million are related to agreements to access and utilize the capacity of third-party equipment and facilities, including pipelines and product terminals, to transport, process, treat, and store products. The remainder is primarily our net share of purchase commitments for materials and services for jointly owned facilities where we are the operator.(c)Excludes pensions and unrecognized income tax benefits. From 2020 through 2024, we expect to contribute an average of $110 million per year to our qualified and nonqualified pension and other postretirement benefit plans in the United States and an average of $25 million per year to our non-U.S. plans. The U.S. five-year average consists of approximately $50 million for 2020 and $120 million per year for the remaining four years. Our minimum funding in 2020 is expected to be $50 million in the United States and $25 million outside the United States. Unrecognized income tax benefits of $40 million and the associated interest and penalties of $10 million were excluded because the ultimate disposition and timing of any payments to be made with regard to such amounts are not reasonably estimable. Although unrecognized income tax benefits are not a contractual obligation, they represent potential demands on our liquidity.(d)We elected to pay the one-time deemed repatriation income tax on foreign-sourced earnings, recognized as a result of the Tax Act enacted in December 2017, in installments over eight years beginning in 2018. The amount represents the remaining income tax liability.54Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsCapital Spending Our capital expenditures and investments represent consolidated capital spending.

Capital spending during this period was primarily for expansion projects, including construction of the Mewbourn 3 and O’Connor 2 plants, and investments in the expansion of Sand Hills NGL pipeline and the Gulf Coast Express pipeline joint venture, as well as maintenance capital expenditures for existing assets.ChemicalsDuring the three-year period ended December 31, 2019, CPChem had a self-funded capital program that totaled $3.0 billion on a 100% basis. The capital spending was primarily for the development of USGC petrochemical projects, debottlenecking projects on existing assets, and the development of a petrochemicals complex in Qatar.RefiningCapital spending for the Refining segment during the three-year period ended December 31, 2019, was $2.7 billion, primarily for refinery upgrade projects to increase accessibility of advantaged crudes and improve product yields; improvements to the operating integrity of key processing units; and safety-related projects. Our equity affiliates in the Refining segment had self-funding capital programs in 2019. During this three-year period, on a 100% basis, WRB’s capital expenditures and investments were $913 million.Key projects completed during the three-year period included: •Installation of facilities to improve clean product yield at the Lake Charles, Ponca City, and Bayway refineries, as well as the jointly owned Borger and Wood River refineries.•Installation of facilities to improve processing of advantaged crudes at the Billings and Lake Charles refineries.•Installation of facilities to comply with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Tier 3 gasoline regulations at the Bayway, Ferndale, and Sweeny refineries.Major construction activities in progress include: •Installation of facilities to increase production of higher-value petrochemical products and higher-octane gasoline at the Sweeny Refinery.•Installation of facilities to produce biofuels at the Humber Refinery.•Installation of facilities to improve clean product yield at the Bayway and Ponca City refineries, as well as the jointly owned Borger Refinery.56Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsMarketing and SpecialtiesCapital spending for the M&S segment during the three-year period ended December 31, 2019, was primarily for the investment in a retail joint venture with operations primarily on the U.S. West Coast; acquisition, construction and improvement of our international retail sites; and safety and reliability projects at our lubricants facilities.Corporate and OtherCapital spending for Corporate and Other during the three-year period ended December 31, 2019, was primarily for information technology and facilities.2020 BudgetOur 2020 capital budget is $3.8 billion, including $469 million of capital expected to be funded by prospective joint venture partners. Our projected $3.8 billion capital budget excludes our portion of planned capital spending by our major joint ventures DCP Midstream, CPChem and WRB totaling $1.2 billion, all of which is expected to be self-funded. Phillips 66 Partners’ planned capital spending of $962 million, which includes $95 million of capital expected to be funded by joint venture partners, is included in the $3.8 billion capital budget.The Midstream capital budget of $2.4 billion, of which $469 million will be funded by joint venture partners, includes funding for the Liberty and Red Oak crude oil pipeline joint ventures and 450,000 BPD of additional fractionation capacity at the Sweeny Hub. The Midstream capital budget also includes growth capital at Phillips 66 Partners to support organic projects, including the Gray Oak Pipeline, the C2G Pipeline, the South Texas Gateway Terminal, and the Bakken Pipeline, as well as sustaining capital. Refining’s capital budget of $1.0 billion is primarily directed toward reliability, safety and environmental projects, as well as high-return projects to enhance the yield of higher-value products, including upgrades to the fluid catalytic cracking units at the Ponca City and Sweeny refineries, renewable diesel projects and other high-return, quick-payout projects designed to enhance margins. In M&S, our budgeted spending includes approximately $160 million of growth and sustaining capital, primarily to develop and enhance our retail sites in Europe. In Corporate and Other, we plan to fund approximately $205 million in projects primarily related to information technology projects, including an investment in a new enterprise resource planning system.ContingenciesA number of lawsuits involving a variety of claims that arose in the ordinary course of business have been filed against us or are subject to indemnifications provided by us. We also may be required to remove or mitigate the effects on the environment of the placement, storage, disposal or release of certain chemical, mineral and petroleum substances at various active and inactive sites. We regularly assess the need for financial recognition or disclosure of these contingencies. In the case of all known contingencies (other than those related to income taxes), we accrue a liability when the loss is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable. If a range of amounts can be reasonably estimated and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount, then the minimum of the range is accrued. We do not reduce these liabilities for potential insurance or third-party recoveries. If applicable, we accrue receivables for probable insurance or other third-party recoveries. In the case of income tax-related contingencies, we use a cumulative probability-weighted loss accrual in cases where sustaining a tax position is less than certain.Based on currently available information, we believe it is remote that future costs related to known contingent liability exposures will exceed current accruals by an amount that would have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements. As we learn new facts concerning contingencies, we reassess our position both with respect to accrued liabilities and other potential exposures. Estimates particularly sensitive to future changes include contingent liabilities recorded for environmental remediation, tax and legal matters. Estimated future environmental remediation costs are subject to change due to such factors as the uncertain magnitude of cleanup costs, the unknown time and extent of such remedial actions that may be required, and the determination of our liability in proportion to that of other potentially responsible parties. Estimated future costs related to tax and legal matters are subject to change as events evolve and as additional information becomes available during the administrative and litigation processes.57Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsLegal and Tax MattersOur legal and tax matters are handled by our legal and tax organizations. These organizations apply their knowledge, experience and professional judgment to the specific characteristics of our cases and uncertain tax positions. We employ a litigation management process to manage and monitor the legal proceedings. Our process facilitates the early evaluation and quantification of potential exposures in individual cases and enables the tracking of those cases that have been scheduled for trial and/or mediation. Based on professional judgment and experience in using these litigation management tools and available information about current developments in all our cases, our legal organization regularly assesses the adequacy of current accruals and determines if adjustment of existing accruals, or establishment of new accruals, is required. In the case of income tax-related contingencies, we monitor tax legislation and court decisions, the status of tax audits and the statute of limitations within which a taxing authority can assert a liability. See Note 21—Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information about income tax-related contingencies.EnvironmentalWe are subject to international, federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. Among the most significant of these international and federal environmental laws and regulations are the: •U.S. Federal Clean Air Act, which governs air emissions.•U.S. Federal Clean Water Act, which governs discharges into water bodies.•European Union Regulation for Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH), which governs production, marketing and use of chemicals.•U.S. Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), which imposes liability on generators, transporters and arrangers of hazardous substances at sites where hazardous substance releases have occurred or are threatening to occur.•U.S. Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), which governs the treatment, storage and disposal of solid waste.•U.S. Federal Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA), which requires facilities to report toxic chemical inventories to local emergency planning committees and response departments.•U.S. Federal Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA90), under which owners and operators of onshore facilities and pipelines as well as owners and operators of vessels are liable for removal costs and damages that result from a discharge of oil into navigable waters of the United States.•European Union Trading Directive resulting in the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS), which uses a market-based mechanism to incentivize the reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.These laws and their implementing regulations set limits on emissions and, in the case of discharges to water, establish water quality limits. They also, in most cases, require permits in association with new or modified operations. These permits can require an applicant to collect substantial information in connection with the application process, which can be expensive and time consuming. In addition, there can be delays associated with notice and comment periods and the agency’s processing of the application. Many of the delays associated with the permitting process are beyond the control of the applicant.Many states and foreign countries where we operate also have, or are developing, similar environmental laws and regulations governing these same types of activities. While similar, in some cases these regulations may impose additional, or more stringent, requirements that can add to the cost and difficulty of developing infrastructure and marketing and transporting products across state and international borders. For example, in California the South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD) approved amendments to the Regional Clean Air Incentives Market (RECLAIM) that became effective in 2016, which require a phased reduction of nitrogen oxide emissions through 2022, affecting refineries in the Los Angeles metropolitan area. In 2017, SCAQMD required additional nitrogen dioxide emissions reductions through 2025 and is now promulgating new regulations to replace the RECLAIM program with a traditional command and control regulatory regime.58Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsThe ultimate financial impact arising from environmental laws and regulations is neither clearly known nor easily determinable as new standards, such as air emission standards, water quality standards and stricter fuel regulations, continue to evolve. However, environmental laws and regulations, including those that may arise to address concerns about global climate change, are expected to continue to have an increasing impact on our operations in the United States and in other countries in which we operate. Notable areas of potential impacts include air emissions compliance and remediation obligations in the United States.An example of this in the fuels area is the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA). It requires fuel producers and importers to provide additional renewable fuels for transportation motor fuels and stipulates a mix of various types. RINs form the mechanism used by the EPA to record compliance with the Renewable Fuel Standard. If an obligated party has more RINs than it needs to meet its obligation, it may sell or trade the extra RINs, or instead choose to “bank” them for use the following year. We have met the stringent requirements to date while establishing implementation, operating and capital strategies, along with advanced technology development, to address projected future requirements. It is uncertain how various future requirements contained in EISA, and the regulations promulgated thereunder, may be implemented and what their full impact may be on our operations. For the 2020 compliance year, the EPA has set volumes of advanced and total renewable fuel at higher levels than in previous years; it is uncertain if these increased obligations will be achievable by fuel producers and shippers without drawing on the RIN bank. Additionally, we may experience a decrease in demand for refined petroleum products due to the regulatory program as currently promulgated. This program continues to be the subject of possible Congressional review and re-promulgation in revised form, and the EPA’s regulations pertaining to the 2014 through 2019 compliance years are subject to legal challenge, further creating uncertainty regarding renewable fuel volume requirements and obligations. Compliance with the regulation has been further complicated as the market for RINs has been the subject of fraudulent third-party activity, and it is possible that some RINs that we have purchased may be determined to be invalid. Should that occur, we could incur costs to replace those fraudulent RINs. Although the cost for replacing any fraudulently marketed RINs is not reasonably estimable at this time, we would not expect to incur the full financial impact of fraudulent RINs replacement costs in any single interim or annual period, and would not expect such costs to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition.We also are subject to certain laws and regulations relating to environmental remediation obligations associated with current and past operations. Such laws and regulations include CERCLA and RCRA and their state equivalents. Remediation obligations include cleanup responsibility arising from petroleum releases from underground storage tanks located at numerous previously and currently owned and/or operated petroleum-marketing outlets throughout the United States. Federal and state laws require contamination caused by such underground storage tank releases be assessed and remediated to meet applicable standards. In addition to other cleanup standards, many states have adopted cleanup criteria for methyl tertiary-butyl ether for both soil and groundwater.At RCRA-permitted facilities, we are required to assess environmental conditions. If conditions warrant, we may be required to remediate contamination caused by prior operations. In contrast to CERCLA, which is often referred to as “Superfund,” the cost of corrective action activities under RCRA corrective action programs typically is borne solely by us. We anticipate increased expenditures for RCRA remediation activities may be required, but such annual expenditures for the near term are not expected to vary significantly from the range of such expenditures we have experienced over the past few years. Longer-term expenditures are subject to considerable uncertainty and may fluctuate significantly.We occasionally receive requests for information or notices of potential liability from the EPA and state environmental agencies alleging that we are a potentially responsible party under CERCLA or an equivalent state statute. On occasion, we also have been made a party to cost recovery litigation by those agencies or by private parties. These requests, notices and lawsuits assert potential liability for remediation costs at various sites that typically are not owned by us, but allegedly contain wastes attributable to our past operations. As of December 31, 2018, we reported that we had been notified of potential liability under CERCLA and comparable state laws at 27 sites within the United States. During 2019, there were no new sites for which we received notice of potential liability nor were any existing sites deemed resolved and closed, leaving 27 unresolved sites with potential liability at December 31, 2019. 59Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsFor the majority of Superfund sites, our potential liability will be less than the total site remediation costs because the percentage of waste attributable to us, versus that attributable to all other potentially responsible parties, is relatively low. Although liability of those potentially responsible is generally joint and several for federal sites and frequently so for state sites, other potentially responsible parties at sites where we are a party typically have had the financial strength to meet their obligations, and where they have not, or where potentially responsible parties could not be located, our share of liability has not increased materially. Many of the sites for which we are potentially responsible are still under investigation by the EPA or the state agencies concerned. Prior to actual cleanup, those potentially responsible normally assess site conditions, apportion responsibility and determine the appropriate remediation. In some instances, we may have no liability or attain a settlement of liability. Actual cleanup costs generally occur after the parties obtain the EPA or equivalent state agency approval of a remediation plan. There are relatively few sites where we are a major participant, and given the timing and amounts of anticipated expenditures, neither the cost of remediation at those sites nor such costs at all CERCLA sites, in the aggregate, is expected to have a material adverse effect on our competitive or financial condition.Expensed environmental costs were $691 million in 2019 and are expected to be approximately $765 million and $760 million in 2020 and 2021, respectively. Capitalized environmental costs were $133 million in 2019 and are expected to be approximately $155 million and $180 million, in 2020 and 2021, respectively. This amount does not include capital expenditures made for another purpose that have an indirect benefit on environmental compliance.Accrued liabilities for remediation activities are not reduced for potential recoveries from insurers or other third parties and are not discounted (except those assumed in a business combination, which we record on a discounted basis).Many of these liabilities result from CERCLA, RCRA and similar state laws that require us to undertake certain investigative and remedial activities at sites where we conduct, or once conducted, operations or at sites where our generated waste was disposed. We also have accrued for a number of sites we identified that may require environmental remediation, but which are not currently the subject of CERCLA, RCRA or state enforcement activities. If applicable, we accrue receivables for probable insurance or other third-party recoveries. In the future, we may incur significant costs under both CERCLA and RCRA. Remediation activities vary substantially in duration and cost from site to site, depending on the mix of unique site characteristics, evolving remediation technologies, diverse regulatory agencies and enforcement policies, and the presence or absence of potentially liable third parties. Therefore, it is difficult to develop reasonable estimates of future site remediation costs.Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, and as with other companies engaged in similar businesses, environmental costs and liabilities are inherent concerns in certain of our operations and products, and there can be no assurance that those costs and liabilities will not be material. However, we currently do not expect any material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position as a result of compliance with current environmental laws and regulations.Climate ChangeThere has been a broad range of proposed or promulgated state, national and international laws focusing on GHG emissions reduction, including various regulations proposed or issued by the EPA. These proposed or promulgated laws apply or could apply in states and/or countries where we have interests or may have interests in the future. Laws regulating GHG emissions continue to evolve, and while it is not possible to accurately estimate either a timetable for implementation or our future compliance costs relating to implementation, such laws potentially could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition as a result of increasing costs of compliance, lengthening project implementation and agency reviews, or reducing demand for certain hydrocarbon products. Examples of legislation or precursors for possible regulation that do or could affect our operations include: •EU ETS, which is part of the European Union’s policy to combat climate change and is a key tool for reducing industrial GHG emissions. EU ETS impacts factories, power stations and other installations across all EU member states. •California’s Senate Bill No. 32, which requires reduction of California's GHG emissions to 40% below the 1990 emission level by 2030, and Assembly Bills 398, which extends the California GHG emission cap-and-trade program through 2030. Other GHG emissions programs in the western U.S. states have been enacted or are under consideration or development, including amendments to California's Low Carbon Fuel Standard, Oregon's Low Carbon Fuel Standard, and Washington's carbon reduction programs.60Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements•The U.S. Supreme Court decision in Massachusetts v. EPA, 549 U.S. 497, 127 S. Ct. 1438 (2007), confirming that the EPA has the authority to regulate carbon dioxide as an “air pollutant” under the Federal Clean Air Act.•The EPA’s announcement on March 29, 2010 (published as “Interpretation of Regulations that Determine Pollutants Covered by Clean Air Act Permitting Programs,” 75 Fed. Reg. 17004 (April 2, 2010)), and the EPA’s and U.S. Department of Transportation’s joint promulgation of a Final Rule on April 1, 2010, that triggers regulation of GHGs under the Clean Air Act. These collectively may lead to more climate-based claims for damages, and may result in longer agency review time for development projects to determine the extent of potential climate change. •The EPA's 2015 Final Rule regulating GHG emissions from existing fossil fuel-fired electrical generating units under the Federal Clean Air Act, commonly referred to as the Clean Power Plan. The EPA commenced rulemaking in 2017 to rescind the Clean Power Plan and, in August 2018, the EPA proposed the Affordable Clean Energy (ACE) rule as its replacement. The ACE rule has been judicially challenged by environmental organizations and several states and municipalities.•Carbon taxes in certain jurisdictions.•GHG emission cap and trade programs in certain jurisdictions.In the EU, the first phase of the EU ETS completed at the end of 2007 and Phase II was undertaken from 2008 through 2012. The current phase (Phase III) runs from 2013 through to 2020, with the main changes being reduced allocation of free allowances and increased auctioning of new allowances. Phillips 66 has assets that are subject to the EU ETS, and the company is actively engaged in minimizing any financial impact from the EU ETS.From November 30 to December 12, 2015, more than 190 countries, including the United States, participated in the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris, France. The conference culminated in what is known as the “Paris Agreement,” which, upon certain conditions being met, entered into force on November 4, 2016. The Paris Agreement establishes a commitment by signatory parties to pursue domestic GHG emission reductions. In 2017, the President of the United States announced his intention to withdraw the United States from the Paris Agreement. On November 4, 2019, the United States submitted formal notification of its withdrawal to the United Nations, triggering a one-year waiting period to final withdrawal.In the United States, some additional form of regulation is likely to be forthcoming in the future at the state or federal levels with respect to GHG emissions. Such regulation could take any of several forms that may result in additional financial burden in the form of taxes, the restriction of output, investments of capital to maintain compliance with laws and regulations, or required acquisition or trading of emission allowances. Compliance with changes in laws and regulations that create a GHG emission trading program, GHG reduction requirements or carbon taxes could significantly increase our costs, reduce demand for fossil energy derived products, impact the cost and availability of capital and increase our exposure to litigation. Such laws and regulations could also increase demand for less carbon intensive energy sources. An example of one such program is California’s cap and trade program, which was promulgated pursuant to the State’s Global Warming Solutions Act. The program had been limited to certain stationary sources, which include our refineries in California, but beginning in January 2015 was expanded to include emissions from transportation fuels distributed in California. Inclusion of transportation fuels in California’s cap and trade program as currently promulgated has increased our cap and trade program compliance costs. The ultimate impact on our financial performance, either positive or negative, from this and similar programs, will depend on a number of factors, including, but not limited to: •Whether and to what extent legislation or regulation is enacted.•The nature of the legislation or regulation, such as a cap and trade system or a tax on emissions.•The GHG reductions required.•The price and availability of offsets.•The demand for, and amount and allocation of allowances.•Technological and scientific developments leading to new products or services.61Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements•Any potential significant physical effects of climate change, such as increased severe weather events, changes in sea levels and changes in temperature.•Whether, and the extent to which, increased compliance costs are ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services.We consider and take into account anticipated future GHG emissions in designing and developing major facilities and projects, and implement energy efficiency initiatives to reduce GHG emissions. Data on our GHG emissions, legal requirements regulating such emissions, and the possible physical effects of climate change on our coastal assets are incorporated into our planning, investment, and risk management decision-making. We are working to continuously improve operational and energy efficiency through resource and energy conservation throughout our operations.62Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATESThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to select appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. See Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for descriptions of our major accounting policies. Some of these accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent that there is a reasonable likelihood that materially different amounts would have been reported under different conditions, or if different assumptions had been used. The following discussion of critical accounting estimates, along with the discussion of contingencies in this report, address all important accounting areas where the nature of accounting estimates or assumptions could be material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change.ImpairmentsLong-lived assets used in operations are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate a possible significant deterioration in future expected cash flows. If the sum of the undiscounted expected future pre-tax cash flows of an asset group is less than the carrying value, including applicable liabilities, the carrying value is written down to estimated fair value. Individual assets are grouped for impairment purposes based on a judgmental assessment of the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets (for example, at a refinery complex level). Because there usually is a lack of quoted market prices for long-lived assets, the fair value of impaired assets is typically determined using one or more of the following methods: the present value of expected future cash flows using discount rates and other assumptions believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants; a market multiple for similar assets; or historical market transactions including similar assets, adjusted using principal market participant assumptions when necessary. The expected future cash flows used for impairment reviews and related fair value calculations are based on judgmental assessments, including future volumes, commodity prices, operating costs, margins, discount rates and capital project decisions, considering all available information at the date of review.Investments in nonconsolidated entities accounted for under the equity method are assessed for impairment when there are indicators of a loss in value, such as a lack of sustained earnings capacity or a current fair value less than the investment’s carrying amount. When it is determined that an indicated impairment is other than temporary, a charge is recognized for the difference between the investment’s carrying value and its estimated fair value. When determining whether a decline in value is other than temporary, management considers factors such as the duration and extent of the decline, the investee’s financial condition and near-term prospects, and our ability and intention to retain our investment for a period that allows for recovery. When quoted market prices are not available, the fair value is usually based on the present value of expected future cash flows using discount rates and other assumptions believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants and observed market earnings multiples of comparable companies, if appropriate. Different assumptions could affect the timing and the amount of an impairment of an investment in any period.Asset Retirement ObligationsUnder various contracts, permits and regulations, we have legal obligations to remove tangible equipment and restore the land at the end of operations at certain operational sites. Our largest asset removal obligations involve asbestos abatement at refineries. Estimating the timing and cost of future asset removals is difficult. Most of these removal obligations are many years, or decades, in the future, and the contracts and regulations often have vague descriptions of what removal practices and criteria must be met when the removal event actually occurs. Asset removal technologies and costs, regulatory and other compliance considerations, expenditure timing, and other inputs into valuation of the obligation, including discount and inflation rates, are also subject to change.Environmental CostsIn addition to asset retirement obligations discussed above, we have certain obligations to complete environmental-related projects. These projects are primarily related to cleanup at domestic refineries, underground storage sites and nonoperated sites. Future environmental remediation costs are difficult to estimate because they are subject to change due to such factors as the uncertain magnitude of cleanup costs, timing and extent of such remedial actions that may be required, and the determination of our liability in proportion to that of other responsible parties.63Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsIntangible Assets and GoodwillAt December 31, 2019, we had $752 million of intangible assets that we have determined to have indefinite useful lives, and therefore do not amortize. The judgmental determination that an intangible asset has an indefinite useful life is continuously evaluated. If, due to changes in facts and circumstances, management determines these intangible assets have finite useful lives, amortization will commence at that time on a prospective basis. As long as these intangible assets are determined to have indefinite lives, they will be subject to at least annual impairment tests that require management’s judgment of their estimated fair value.At December 31, 2019, we had $3.3 billion of goodwill recorded in conjunction with past business combinations. Goodwill is not amortized. Instead, goodwill is subject to at least annual tests for impairment at a reporting unit level. A reporting unit is an operating segment or a component that is one level below an operating segment and they are determined primarily based on the manner in which the business is managed. We perform our annual goodwill impairment test using a qualitative assessment and a quantitative assessment, if one is deemed necessary. As part of our qualitative assessment, we evaluate relevant events and circumstances that could affect the fair value of our reporting units, including macroeconomic conditions, overall industry and market considerations and regulatory changes, as well as company-specific market metrics, performance and events. The evaluation of company-specific events and circumstances includes evaluating changes in our stock price and cost of capital, actual and forecasted financial performance, as well as the effect of significant asset dispositions. If our qualitative assessment indicates it is likely the fair value of a reporting unit has declined below its carrying value (including goodwill), a quantitative assessment is performed.When a quantitative assessment is performed, management applies judgment in determining the estimated fair values of the reporting units because quoted market prices for our reporting units are not available. Management uses available information to make this fair value determination, including estimated future cash flows, cost of capital, observed market earnings multiples of comparable companies, our common stock price and associated total company market capitalization. We completed our annual qualitative assessment of goodwill as of October 1, 2019, and concluded that the fair values of our reporting units continued to exceed their respective carrying values (including goodwill) by significant percentages. A decline in the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting units in the future could result in an impairment. As such, we continue to monitor for indicators of impairment until our next annual impairment test is performed.Tax Assets and LiabilitiesOur operations are subject to various taxes, including federal, state and foreign income taxes, property taxes, and transactional taxes such as excise, sales/use, value-added and payroll taxes. We record tax liabilities based on our assessment of existing tax laws and regulations. The recording of tax liabilities requires significant judgment and estimates. We recognize the financial statement effects of an income tax position when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination by a taxing authority. A contingent liability related to a transactional tax claim is recorded if the loss is both probable and reasonably estimable. Actual incurred tax liabilities can vary from our estimates for a variety of reasons, including different interpretations of tax laws and regulations and different assessments of the amount of tax due.In determining our income tax expense (benefit), we assess the likelihood our deferred tax assets will be recovered through future taxable income. Valuation allowances reduce deferred tax assets to an amount that will, more likely than not, be realized. Judgment is required in estimating the amount of valuation allowance, if any, that should be recorded against our deferred tax assets. Based on our historical taxable income, our expectations for the future, and available tax-planning strategies, we expect the net deferred tax assets will more likely than not be realized as offsets to reversing deferred tax liabilities and as reductions to future taxable income. If our actual results of operations differ from such estimates or our estimates of future taxable income change, the valuation allowance may need to be revised.New tax laws and regulations, as well as changes to existing tax laws and regulations, are continuously being proposed or promulgated. The implementation of future legislative and regulatory tax initiatives could result in increased income tax liabilities that cannot be predicted at this time.64Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsProjected Benefit Obligations Calculation of the projected benefit obligations for our defined benefit pension and postretirement plans impacts the obligations on the balance sheet and the amount of benefit expense in the income statement. The actuarial calculation of projected benefit obligations and company contribution requirements involves judgment about uncertain future events, including estimated retirement dates, salary levels at retirement, mortality rates, lump-sum election rates, rates of return on plan assets, future interest rates, future health care cost-trend rates, and rates of utilization of health care services by retirees. We engage outside actuarial firms to assist in the calculation of these projected benefit obligations and company contribution requirements due to the specialized nature of these calculations. As financial accounting rules and the pension plan funding regulations promulgated by governmental agencies have different objectives and requirements, the actuarial methods and assumptions for the two purposes differ in certain important respects. Ultimately, we will be required to fund all promised benefits under pension and postretirement benefit plans not funded by plan assets or investment returns, but the judgmental assumptions used in the actuarial calculations significantly affect periodic financial statements and funding patterns over time. Benefit expense is particularly sensitive to the discount rate and return on plan assets assumptions. A one percentage-point decrease in the discount rate assumption used for the plan obligation would increase annual benefit expense by an estimated $55 million, while a one percentage-point decrease in the return on plan assets assumption would increase annual benefit expense by an estimated $35 million. In determining the discount rate, we use yields on high-quality fixed income investments with payments matched to the estimated distributions of benefits from our plans.The expected weighted-average long-term rate of return for worldwide pension plan assets was approximately 6% for both 2019 and 2018, while the actual weighted-average rate of return was 18% in 2019 and negative 4% in 2018. For the past ten years, our actual weighted-average rate of return for worldwide pension plan assets was 9%.65Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsNON-GAAP RECONCILIATIONSRefiningOur realized refining margins measure the difference between a) sales and other operating revenues derived from the sale of petroleum products manufactured at our refineries and b) purchase costs of feedstocks, primarily crude oil, used to produce the petroleum products. The realized refining margins are adjusted to include our proportional share of our joint venture refineries’ realized margins, as well as to exclude those items that are not representative of the underlying operating performance of a period, which we call “special items.” The realized refining margins are converted to a per-barrel basis by dividing them by total refinery processed inputs (primarily crude oil) measured on a barrel basis, including our share of inputs processed by our joint venture refineries. Our realized refining margin per barrel is intended to be comparable with industry refining margins, which are known as “crack spreads.” As discussed in “Business Environment,” industry crack spreads measure the difference between market prices for refined petroleum products and crude oil. We believe realized refining margin per barrel calculated on a similar basis as industry crack spreads provides a useful measure of how well we performed relative to benchmark industry refining margins.The GAAP performance measure most directly comparable to realized refining margin per barrel is the Refining segment’s “income (loss) before income taxes per barrel.” Realized refining margin per barrel excludes items that are typically included in a manufacturer’s gross margin, such as depreciation and operating expenses, and other items used to determine income (loss) before income taxes, such as general and administrative expenses. It also includes our proportional share of joint venture refineries’ realized refining margins and excludes special items. Because realized refining margin per barrel is calculated in this manner, and because realized refining margin per barrel may be defined differently by other companies in our industry, it has limitations as an analytical tool.

The realized marketing fuel margins are adjusted to exclude those items that are not representative of the underlying operating performance of a period, which we call “special items.” The realized marketing fuel margins are converted to a per-barrel basis by dividing them by sales volumes measured on a barrel basis.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKFinancial Instrument Market RiskWe and certain of our subsidiaries are exposed to market risks produced by changes in the prices of crude oil, refined petroleum products, natural gas, NGL and electric power, as well as fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. We and certain of our subsidiaries may hold and use derivative contracts to manage these risks.Commodity Price RiskGenerally, our policy is to remain exposed to the market prices of commodities. Consistent with this policy, we use derivative contracts to convert our exposure from fixed-price sales or purchase contracts, often specified in contracts with refined petroleum product customers, back to floating market prices. We also use futures, forwards, swaps and options in various markets to accomplish the following objectives:•Balance physical systems or to meet our refinery requirements and market demand. In addition to cash settlement prior to contract expiration, exchange-traded futures contracts may be settled by physical delivery of the underlying commodity.•Enable us to use the market knowledge gained from our physical commodity market activities to capture market opportunities, such as moving physical commodities to more profitable locations, storing commodities to capture seasonal or time premiums, and blending commodities to capture quality upgrades. Derivatives may be utilized to optimize these activities. •Manage the risk to our cash flows from price exposures on specific crude oil, refined petroleum product, natural gas and NGL transactions.These objectives optimize the value of our supply chain and may reduce our exposure to fluctuations in market prices.Our use of derivative instruments is governed by an “Authority Limitations” document approved by our Board of Directors, which prohibits the use of highly leveraged derivatives or derivative instruments without sufficient market liquidity for comparable valuations and establishes Value at Risk (VaR) limits. Compliance with these limits is monitored daily by our global risk group. We use a VaR model to estimate the loss in fair value that could potentially result on a single day from the effect of adverse changes in market conditions on the derivative commodity instruments held or issued. Using Monte Carlo simulation, a 95% confidence level and a one-day holding period, the VaR for derivative commodity instruments issued or held at December 31, 2019 and 2018, was immaterial to our cash flows and net income.70Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsInterest Rate RiskOur use of fixed- or variable-rate debt directly exposes us to interest rate risk. Fixed-rate debt, such as our senior notes, exposes us to changes in the fair value of our debt due to changes in market interest rates. Fixed-rate debt also exposes us to the risk that we may need to refinance maturing debt with new debt at higher rates, or that we may be obligated to pay rates higher than the current market. Variable-rate debt, such as our floating-rate notes or borrowings under our revolving credit facility, exposes us to short-term changes in market rates that impact our interest expense. The following tables provide information about our debt instruments that are sensitive to changes in U.S. interest rates. These tables present principal cash flows and related weighted-average interest rates by expected maturity dates. Weighted-average variable rates are based on effective rates at each reporting date. The carrying amount of our floating-rate debt approximates its fair value. The fair value of the fixed-rate financial instruments is estimated based on observable market prices.

1534701,PSX,Phillips 66,2021,"Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSManagement’s Discussion and Analysis is the company’s analysis of its financial performance and financial condition, and of significant trends that may affect future performance. It should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.The terms “earnings” and “loss” refer to net income (loss) attributable to Phillips 66. The terms “before-tax income” or “before-tax loss” refer to income (loss) before income taxes. EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW AND BUSINESS ENVIRONMENTPhillips 66 is an energy manufacturing and logistics company with midstream, chemicals, refining, and marketing and specialties businesses. At December 31, 2020, we had total assets of $54.7 billion.Executive OverviewThe COVID-19 pandemic continues to disrupt economic activities globally. Actions taken by governments to prevent the spread of the disease, including travel and business restrictions, have resulted in substantial decreases in the demand for many refined petroleum products, particularly gasoline and jet fuel. The lack of demand for petroleum products has resulted in low crude oil prices and refining margins. Accordingly, crude oil producers have shut in high cost production, and refiners have reduced crude oil processing rates. During 2020, we took the following significant steps to enhance our liquidity in this challenged margin environment:•Issued $3.75 billion of senior unsecured notes and borrowed a net $500 million under a term loan facility.•Temporarily suspended our share repurchase program.•Reduced consolidated capital spending in 2020 by more than $700 million compared with our original budget.•Exceeded our $500 million cost reduction target in 2020.In 2020, we reported a loss of $4.0 billion and generated $2.1 billion in cash from operating activities. We used available cash and the debt financing noted above to fund capital expenditures and investments of $2.9 billion, pay dividends of $1.6 billion, and repurchase $0.4 billion of our common stock. We ended 2020 with $2.5 billion of cash and cash equivalents and approximately $5.3 billion of total committed capacity available under our credit facilities.Our results in 2020 reflect the adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including asset and investment impairments. These adverse effects may continue to be significant in the near term. The depth and duration of the economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic remain unknown. We continuously monitor our asset and investment portfolio for impairments, as well as optimization opportunities, in this challenging business environment. As such, additional impairments may be required in the future.36Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsWe continue to focus on the following strategic priorities:•Operating Excellence. Our commitment to operating excellence guides everything we do. We are committed to protecting the health and safety of everyone who has a role in our operations and the communities in which we operate. Continuous improvement in safety, environmental stewardship, reliability and cost efficiency is a fundamental requirement for our company and employees. We employ rigorous training and audit programs to drive ongoing improvement in both personal and process safety as we strive for zero incidents. In 2020, we achieved a 0.11 total recordable incident rate—the lowest since our inception. Since we cannot control commodity prices, controlling operating expenses and overhead costs, within the context of our commitment to safety and environmental stewardship, is a high priority. Senior management actively monitors these costs. We are committed to protecting the environment and strive to reduce our environmental footprint throughout our operations. Optimizing utilization rates at our refineries through reliable and safe operations enables us to capture the value available in the market in terms of prices and margins. During 2020, our worldwide refining crude oil capacity utilization rate was 76%, mainly driven by the decrease in market demand for refined petroleum products due to negative impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic. •Growth. A disciplined capital allocation process ensures we invest in projects that are expected to generate competitive returns. Our strategy primarily focuses on investing in growth opportunities in the Midstream and Chemicals segments. In response to the challenging market conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, we reduced our 2021 capital budget to $1.7 billion. We are prioritizing sustaining capital spending and completion of in-progress growth projects, as well as advancing our investments in renewable fuels. In the third quarter of 2020, we announced Rodeo Renewed, a project to reconfigure our San Francisco Refinery in Rodeo, California, to produce renewable fuels. In 2021, we have budgeted $615 million for Midstream capital expenditures and investments, including $305 million for Phillips 66 Partners. Capital will be used to complete near-term committed and optimization projects and to maintain our integrated logistics infrastructure network. In Chemicals, our share of expected self-funded capital spending by CPChem is $410 million. CPChem plans to use its growth capital to fund expansion of its normal alpha olefins production, optimization and debottleneck opportunities in the olefins and polyolefins chains, as well as continuing development of petrochemical projects on the U.S. Gulf Coast and in Qatar. We recently formed an Emerging Energy organization. This group is charged with establishing a lower-carbon business platform that delivers attractive returns. It will focus on opportunities within our portfolio, such as Rodeo Renewed, as well as commercializing emerging energy technologies for a sustainable future.•Returns. We plan to enhance Refining returns by increasing throughput of advantaged feedstocks, improving yields, portfolio optimization and an ongoing commitment to operating excellence. For 2021, capital in Refining will be directed toward high-return projects to enhance the yield of higher-value products and other high-return, quick-payout projects, as well as investments to competitively position the company for a lower-carbon future. M&S will continue to develop and enhance our retail network and brands in the United States and Europe. •Distributions. We believe shareholder value is enhanced through, among other things, consistent growth of regular dividends, complemented by share repurchases. Regular dividends demonstrate the confidence our Board of Directors and management have in our capital structure and operations’ capability to generate free cash flow throughout the business cycle. In 2020, despite the challenging business environment, we maintained stable quarterly dividend distributions to shareholders and repurchased $443 million of common stock before suspending our share repurchase program in March 2020 to preserve liquidity.•High-Performing Organization. We strive to attract, develop and retain individuals with the knowledge and skills to implement our business strategy and who support our values and culture. Throughout the company, we focus on getting results in the right way, embrace our values as a common bond, and believe success is both what we do and how we do it. We encourage collaboration throughout our company, while valuing differences, respecting diversity, and creating a great place to work. We foster an environment of learning and development through structured programs focused on enhancing functional and technical skills where employees are engaged in our business and committed to their own, as well as the company’s, success.37Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsBusiness EnvironmentThe Midstream segment includes our Transportation and NGL businesses. Our Transportation business contains fee-based operations that are not directly exposed to commodity price risk. Our NGL business contains both fee-based operations and operations that are directly impacted by NGL prices. The Midstream segment also includes our 50% equity investment in DCP Midstream. NGL prices were significantly lower in 2020, compared with 2019, due to negative economic impacts caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The Chemicals segment consists of our 50% equity investment in CPChem. The chemicals and plastics industry is mainly a commodity-based industry where the margins for key products are based on supply and demand, as well as cost factors. Compared with 2019, the benchmark high-density polyethylene chain margin was lower in the first three quarters of 2020, before rebounding strongly in the fourth quarter of 2020. The lower margin in the first three quarters of 2020 was mainly due to lower polyethylene sales prices. The significant margin increase in the fourth quarter of 2020 was primarily driven by tight supply caused by hurricane impacts in the Gulf Coast region and a strong global market demand.Our Refining segment results are driven by several factors, including refining margins, refinery throughput, feedstock costs, product yields, turnaround activity, and other operating costs. The price of U.S. benchmark crude oil, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) at Cushing, Oklahoma, decreased to an average of $39.31 per barrel during 2020, compared with an average of $57.02 per barrel in 2019, due to a significant decline in global demand driven by the adverse impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Market crack spreads are used as indicators of refining margins and measure the difference between market prices for refined petroleum products and crude oil. During 2020, the worldwide market crack spreads were significantly lower compared with 2019, mainly driven by a sharp decline in demand for refined petroleum products resulting from the COVID-19 global pandemic.Results for our M&S segment depend largely on marketing fuel and lubricant margins, and sales volumes of our refined petroleum and other specialty products. While M&S margins are primarily driven by market factors, largely determined by the relationship between supply and demand, marketing fuel margins, in particular, are influenced by the trend in spot prices for refined petroleum products. Generally speaking, a downward trend of spot prices has a favorable impact on marketing fuel margins, while an upward trend of spot prices has an unfavorable impact on marketing fuel margins. The global disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic significantly reduced demand for our refined petroleum and specialty products in 2020 compared with 2019.38Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsRESULTS OF OPERATIONSConsolidated ResultsA summary of income (loss) before income taxes by business segment with a reconciliation to net income (loss) attributable to Phillips 66 follows: Millions of DollarsYear Ended December 31 202020192018Midstream$(9)684 1,181 Chemicals635 879 1,025 Refining(6,155)1,986 4,535 Marketing and Specialties1,446 1,433 1,557 Corporate and Other(881)(804)(853)Income (loss) before income taxes(4,964)4,178 7,445 Income tax expense (benefit)(1,250)801 1,572 Net income (loss)(3,714)3,377 5,873 Less: net income attributable to noncontrolling interests261 301 278 Net income (loss) attributable to Phillips 66$(3,975)3,076 5,595 2020 vs. 2019 Our results decreased $7,051 million in 2020, mainly reflecting: •Lower realized refining margins and decreased refinery production.•A goodwill impairment in our Refining segment.•A long-lived asset impairment associated with our plan to reconfigure the San Francisco Refinery into a renewable fuels facility, which impacted our Refining and Midstream segments.•Higher impairments of equity investments in our Midstream segment.These decreases were partially offset by an income tax benefit recognized in 2020, compared with income tax expense recognized in 2019. 2019 vs. 2018 Our earnings decreased $2,519 million in 2019, mainly reflecting: •Lower realized refining and marketing margins.•Impairments associated with our equity investment in DCP Midstream.•Decreased equity in earnings of affiliates in our Refining and Chemicals segments.These decreases were partially offset by:•Lower income tax expense.•Improved results from our NGL and transportation businesses. See the “Segment Results” section for additional information on our segment results.39Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsStatement of Operations Analysis2020 vs. 2019 Sales and other operating revenues and purchased crude oil and products both decreased 40% in 2020. The decreases were mainly due to lower prices and volumes for refined petroleum products and crude oil, reflecting the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Equity in earnings of affiliates decreased 44% in 2020. The decrease was primarily due to lower realized refining margins and decreased refinery production at WRB, and lower margins, partially offset by higher sales volumes, at CPChem. See Chemicals segment analysis in the “Segment Results” section for additional information on CPChem. Net gain on dispositions increased $88 million in 2020. The increase was mainly due to a gain of $84 million associated with a co-venturer’s prior-year acquisition of a 35% interest in Phillips 66 Partners’ consolidated holding company that owns an interest in Gray Oak Pipeline, LLC. See Note 27—Phillips 66 Partners LP, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information.Operating expenses decreased 10% in 2020, primarily driven by our company-wide cost reduction initiatives in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, lower utility costs, and decreased refinery turnaround activities.Impairments increased $3,391 million in 2020. See Note 9—Impairments, and Note 16—Fair Value Measurements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information associated with impairments.We had an income tax benefit of $1,250 million in 2020, compared with income tax expense of $801 million in 2019, primarily due to a net loss in 2020 versus net income in 2019. See Note 21—Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for more information regarding our income taxes.2019 vs. 2018 Sales and other operating revenues and purchased crude oil and products decreased 4% and 2%, respectively, in 2019. The decreases were mainly driven by lower prices for refined petroleum products, crude oil and NGL. Equity in earnings of affiliates decreased 21% in 2019. The decrease was mainly due to lower margins at WRB and CPChem, partially offset by improved results from our Transportation and NGL joint venture assets. Lower equity earnings in 2019 also reflected higher goodwill and other asset impairments at DCP Midstream. See the “Segment Results” section for additional information.Other income increased $58 million in 2019. The increase was mainly driven by trading activities not directly related to our physical business. See Note 15—Derivatives and Financial Instruments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information associated with our commodity derivatives.Impairments increased $853 million in 2019. The increase was driven by an $853 million before-tax impairment associated with our investment in DCP Midstream recognized in the third quarter of 2019. See Note 9—Impairments, and Note 16—Fair Value Measurements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information associated with this impairment.Income tax expense (benefit) decreased 49% in 2019. The decrease in income tax expense was primarily attributable to lower income before income taxes. See Note 21—Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for more information regarding our income taxes.40Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsSegment ResultsMidstream Year Ended December 31 202020192018 Millions of DollarsIncome (Loss) Before Income TaxesTransportation$508 946 770 NGL and Other441 522 305 DCP Midstream(958)(784)106 Total Midstream$(9)684 1,181 Thousands of Barrels DailyTransportation VolumesPipelines*3,005 3,396 3,441 Terminals2,971 3,315 3,153 Operating StatisticsNGL fractionated**249 224 216 NGL extracted***399 417 413 * Pipelines represent the sum of volumes transported through each separately tariffed consolidated pipeline segment. ** Excludes DCP Midstream.*** Includes 100% of DCP Midstream’s volumes.

This segment includes our MLP, Phillips 66 Partners, as well as our 50% equity investment in DCP Midstream, which includes the operations of its MLP, DCP Partners.2020 vs. 2019 Midstream’s results decreased $693 million in 2020, compared with 2019. Results from our Transportation business decreased $438 million in 2020, compared with 2019. The decrease was primarily attributable to before-tax impairments of $300 million, decreased equity earnings, lower pipeline and terminal throughput volumes, and higher operating costs, partially offset by an $84 million before-tax gain recognized in the second quarter of 2020 associated with the Gray Oak Pipeline joint venture.The $300 million before-tax impairments consisted of a $120 million impairment of the pipeline and terminal assets associated with the planned reconfiguration of our San Francisco Refinery into a renewable fuels facility, a $96 million impairment of Phillips 66 Partners’ equity investments in two crude oil logistics joint ventures, and an $84 million impairment of our equity investment in the canceled Red Oak Pipeline project. See Note 9—Impairments, and Note 27—Phillips 66 Partners LP, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information regarding the impairments and the $84 million before-tax gain, respectively.41Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsResults from our NGL and Other business decreased $81 million in 2020, compared with 2019. The decrease was mainly due to lower results from our trading activities and decreased margins, partially offset by higher export cargos and increased fractionation volumes from the startup of Frac 2 and Frac 3 in late 2020, as well as the startup of a new isomerization unit at our Lake Charles Refinery in the second half of 2019.Results from our investment in DCP Midstream decreased $174 million in 2020, compared with 2019. The decrease was primarily due to higher impairment charges, partially offset by the recognition of a larger benefit to our equity earnings from the amortization of the basis difference associated with the impairments and DCP Midstream’s cost reduction initiatives in response to the challenging business environment. See Note 6—Investments, Loans and Long-Term Receivables, and Note 9—Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information regarding the impairments and the associated basis difference amortization related to our investment in DCP Midstream.See the “Executive Overview and Business Environment” section for information on market factors impacting 2020 results.2019 vs. 2018 Before-tax income from the Midstream segment decreased $497 million in 2019, compared with 2018, mainly driven by an $853 million before-tax impairment associated with our investment in DCP Midstream and lower equity earnings from DCP Midstream, partially offset by improved results from our Transportation and NGL and Other businesses. Before-tax income from our Transportation business increased $176 million in 2019, compared with 2018. The increase was mainly driven by higher volumes and pipeline tariffs from our portfolio of consolidated and joint venture assets.Before-tax income from our NGL and Other business increased $217 million in 2019, compared with 2018. The increase was mainly due to improved margins and volumes, primarily at the Sweeny Hub, and higher equity earnings from certain pipeline affiliates driven by higher volumes.Before-tax income from our investment in DCP Midstream decreased $890 million in 2019, compared with 2018. The decrease was primarily due to an $853 million before-tax impairment associated with our investment in DCP Midstream and lower equity earnings driven by higher goodwill and other asset impairments at DCP Partners in 2019.

CPChem uses NGL and other feedstocks to produce petrochemicals. These products are then marketed and sold or used as feedstocks to produce plastics and other chemicals. We structure our reporting of CPChem’s operations around two primary business lines: Olefins and Polyolefins (O&P) and Specialties, Aromatics and Styrenics (SA&S). The O&P business line produces and markets ethylene and other olefin products. Ethylene produced is primarily consumed within CPChem for the production of polyethylene, normal alpha olefins and polyethylene pipe. The SA&S business line manufactures and markets aromatics and styrenics products, such as benzene, cyclohexane, styrene and polystyrene. SA&S also manufactures and/or markets a variety of specialty chemical products. Unless otherwise noted, amounts referenced below reflect our net 50% interest in CPChem.2020 vs. 2019 Before-tax income from the Chemicals segment decreased $244 million in 2020, compared with 2019. The decrease was mainly due to lower margins and decreased earnings from CPChem’s equity affiliates, partially offset by higher sales volumes and a favorable impact from lower-of-cost-or-market adjustments of inventories valued on the last-in-first-out (LIFO) basis attributable to petrochemical product price recovery in 2020. See the “Executive Overview and Business Environment” section for information on market factors impacting CPChem’s 2020 results.2019 vs. 2018 Before-tax income from the Chemicals segment decreased $146 million in 2019, compared with 2018. The decrease was mainly due to lower polyethylene margins attributable to additional industry capacity and slower demand growth in Asia. In addition, CPChem recorded lower-of-cost-or-market write-downs of LIFO-valued inventories during 2019, and our portion of the write-downs reduced our equity earnings from CPChem by $65 million, before-tax. The decreases were partially offset by higher polyethylene sales volumes and lower turnaround and maintenance activity during 2019.43Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsRefining Year Ended December 31 202020192018Millions of DollarsIncome (Loss) Before Income TaxesAtlantic Basin/Europe$(1,224)608 567 Gulf Coast(2,077)364 1,040 Central Corridor(641)1,338 2,817 West Coast(2,213)(324)111 Worldwide$(6,155)1,986 4,535 Dollars Per BarrelIncome (Loss) Before Income TaxesAtlantic Basin/Europe$(7.18)3.11 3.05 Gulf Coast(9.71)1.24 3.55 Central Corridor(6.96)12.95 26.50 West Coast(20.01)(2.49)0.81 Worldwide(10.48)2.75 6.29 Realized Refining Margins*Atlantic Basin/Europe$2.17 9.33 10.32 Gulf Coast1.85 7.42 9.48 Central Corridor7.17 14.91 22.22 West Coast3.43 9.18 11.20 Worldwide3.51 9.91 12.99 * See the “Non-GAAP Reconciliations” section for a reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure to the most directly comparable measure under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), income (loss) before income taxes per barrel.44Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsThousands of Barrels Daily Year Ended December 31 202020192018Operating StatisticsRefining operations*Atlantic Basin/EuropeCrude oil capacity537 537 537 Crude oil processed434 497 477 Capacity utilization (percent)81 %92 89 Refinery production470 541 514 Gulf CoastCrude oil capacity769 764 752 Crude oil processed533 725 717 Capacity utilization (percent)69 %95 95 Refinery production586 804 808 Central CorridorCrude oil capacity530 515 493 Crude oil processed431 498 507 Capacity utilization (percent)81 %97 103 Refinery production446 518 530 West CoastCrude oil capacity364 364 364 Crude oil processed279 323 343 Capacity utilization (percent)77 %89 94 Refinery production301 354 373 WorldwideCrude oil capacity2,200 2,180 2,146 Crude oil processed1,677 2,043 2,044 Capacity utilization (percent)76 %94 95 Refinery production1,803 2,217 2,225 * Includes our share of equity affiliates.The Refining segment refines crude oil and other feedstocks into petroleum products, such as gasoline, distillates and aviation fuels, at 13 refineries in the United States and Europe. 2020 vs. 2019 Results from the Refining segment decreased $8,141 million in 2020, compared with 2019. The decreased results in 2020 were due to:•Lower realized refining margins and decreased refinery production. A sharp decline in demand for refined petroleum products resulting from global economic disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic led to lower market crack spreads and reduced refinery production in 2020. In addition, hurricane impacts contributed to the lower refinery production in the Gulf Coast region in 2020.•A before-tax long-lived asset impairment of $910 million in the third quarter of 2020 associated with our plan to reconfigure the San Francisco Refinery into a renewable fuels facility.•A before-tax goodwill impairment of $1,845 million in the first quarter of 2020.45Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsOur worldwide refining crude oil capacity utilization rate was 76% and 94% in 2020 and 2019, respectively. The lower utilization rate in 2020 was primarily due to reduced refining runs driven by lower demand for refined petroleum products as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as hurricane impacts in the Gulf Coast region. See the “Executive Overview and Business Environment” section for information on industry crack spreads and other market factors impacting this year’s results.2019 vs. 2018 Before-tax income for the Refining segment decreased $2,549 million in 2019, compared with 2018. The decrease was primarily driven by lower realized refining margins and lower refinery production at certain refineries due to turnaround activities and unplanned downtime. In 2019, the decrease in realized refining margins was primarily due to lower feedstock advantage driven by narrowing heavy crude differentials.Our worldwide refining crude oil capacity utilization rate was 94% and 95% in 2019 and 2018, respectively. 46Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsMarketing and Specialties Year Ended December 31202020192018Millions of DollarsIncome Before Income TaxesMarketing and Other$1,271 1,199 1,306 Specialties175 234 251 Total Marketing and Specialties$1,446 1,433 1,557 Dollars Per BarrelIncome Before Income TaxesU.S.$1.42 1.22 1.21 International4.84 3.58 5.00 Realized Marketing Fuel Margins*U.S.$1.87 1.57 1.62 International6.34 4.90 6.87 * See the “Non-GAAP Reconciliations” section for a reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, income before income taxes per barrel.Dollars Per GallonU.S. Average Wholesale Prices*Gasoline$1.56 2.12 2.20 Distillates1.47 2.12 2.29 * On third-party branded refined petroleum product sales, excluding excise taxes.Thousands of Barrels DailyMarketing Refined Petroleum Product SalesGasoline1,021 1,230 1,195 Distillates895 1,104 975 Other17 18 18 1,933 2,352 2,188 The M&S segment purchases for resale and markets refined petroleum products, such as gasoline, distillates and aviation fuels, mainly in the United States and Europe.

The increase was primarily attributable to higher realized marketing fuel margins, partially offset by lower sales volumes for refined petroleum and specialty products driven by decreased demand.See the “Executive Overview and Business Environment” section for information on marketing fuel margins and other market factors impacting 2020 results.2019 vs. 2018 Before-tax income from the M&S segment decreased $124 million in 2019, compared with 2018.

See Note 12—Debt, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information on the debt issuances in 2020. 2019 vs. 2018 Net interest expense decreased $44 million in 2019, compared with 2018, mainly due to higher capitalized interest related to capital projects under development in our Midstream segment, partially offset by higher debt balances in 2019. 48Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsCAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITYFinancial IndicatorsMillions of Dollars, Except as Indicated202020192018Cash and cash equivalents$2,514 1,614 3,019 Net cash provided by operating activities2,111 4,808 7,573 Short-term debt987 547 67 Total debt15,893 11,763 11,160 Total equity21,523 27,169 27,153 Percent of total debt to capital*42 %30 29 Percent of floating-rate debt to total debt12 %9 11 * Capital includes total debt and total equity.To meet our short- and long-term liquidity requirements, we use a variety of funding sources but rely primarily on cash generated from operating activities and debt financing. During 2020, we generated $2.1 billion in cash from operations and had net borrowings of $4.1 billion. We used available cash primarily for capital expenditures and investments of $2.9 billion and dividend payments on our common stock of $1.6 billion. During the first quarter of 2020, we repurchased $443 million of common stock before suspending our share repurchase program in March 2020. During 2020, cash and cash equivalents increased $900 million to $2.5 billion.Significant Sources of CapitalOperating ActivitiesDuring 2020, cash generated by operating activities was $2,111 million, a 56% decrease compared with 2019. The decrease was primarily due to lower realized refining margins, driven by the global economic disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by lower cash income taxes paid. During 2019, cash generated by operating activities was $4,808 million, a 37% decrease compared with 2018. The decrease was mainly driven by lower realized refining margins and decreased distributions from our equity affiliates, along with unfavorable working capital impacts, partially offset by improved results from our Transportation and NGL and Other businesses. Our short- and long-term operating cash flows are highly dependent upon refining and marketing margins, NGL prices and chemicals margins. Prices and margins in our industry are typically volatile, and are driven by market conditions over which we have little or no control. Absent other mitigating factors, as these prices and margins fluctuate, we would expect a corresponding change in our operating cash flows. The recent decline in demand for refined petroleum products has led to a decrease in refining margins. If the global economic disruption associated with the COVID-19 pandemic sustains, we expect refining margins to remain challenged in the near term, all of which could have an unfavorable impact on our future operating cash flows. The level and quality of output from our refineries also impacts our cash flows. Factors such as operating efficiency, maintenance turnarounds, market conditions, feedstock availability and weather conditions can affect output. We actively manage the operations of our refineries, and any variability in their operations typically has not been as significant to cash flows as that caused by margins and prices. However, the recent decline in demand for refined petroleum products has led to a reduction of our refinery production. If the global economic disruption associated with the COVID-19 pandemic sustains, we expect refinery production, along with marketing, transportation and terminaling volumes, to remain challenged in the near term, which could have an unfavorable impact on our future operating cash flows. Our worldwide refining crude oil capacity utilization was 76%, 94% and 95% in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.49Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsEquity Affiliate Operating DistributionsOur operating cash flows are also impacted by distribution decisions made by our equity affiliates, including CPChem, DCP Midstream and WRB. Over the three years ended December 31, 2020, our operating cash flows included aggregate distributions from our equity affiliates of $6,406 million, including $290 million from DCP Midstream, $2,490 million from CPChem and $1,230 million from WRB. We cannot control the amount or timing of future distributions from equity affiliates; therefore, future distributions are not assured.Tax RefundsAn income tax receivable of $1.5 billion is included in the “Accounts and notes receivable” line item on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2020, which reflects tax refunds we expect to receive within the next 12 months. Phillips 66 PartnersIn 2013, we formed Phillips 66 Partners, a publicly traded MLP, to own, operate, develop and acquire primarily fee-based midstream assets.Ownership and Restructuring TransactionOn August 1, 2019, Phillips 66 Partners completed a restructuring transaction to eliminate the incentive distribution rights (IDRs) held by us and to convert our 2% economic general partner interest into a noneconomic general partner interest in exchange for 101 million Phillips 66 Partners common units. No distributions were made for the general partner interest after August 1, 2019. At December 31, 2020, we owned 170 million Phillips 66 Partners common units, representing 74% of Phillips 66 Partners’ limited partner units. We consolidate Phillips 66 Partners as a variable interest entity for financial reporting purposes. See Note 27—Phillips 66 Partners LP, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information on why we consolidate the partnership. As a result of this consolidation, the public common and preferred unitholders’ interests in Phillips 66 Partners are reflected as noncontrolling interests of $2,219 million in our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2020. Debt and Equity FinancingsDuring the three years ended December 31, 2020, Phillips 66 Partners raised net proceeds of approximately $1 billion from the following third-party debt and equity offerings:•In September 2019, Phillips 66 Partners received net proceeds of $892 million from the issuance of $300 million of 2.450% Senior Notes due December 2024 and $600 million of 3.150% Senior Notes due December 2029.•In March 2019, Phillips 66 Partners entered into a senior unsecured term loan facility with a borrowing capacity of $400 million due March 20, 2020. Phillips 66 Partners borrowed an aggregate amount of $400 million under the facility during the first half of 2019, which was repaid in full in September 2019. •Phillips 66 Partners has authorized an aggregate of $750 million under three $250 million continuous offerings of common units, or at-the-market (ATM) programs. Phillips 66 Partners completed the first two programs in June 2018 and December 2019, respectively. For the three years ended December 31, 2020, net proceeds of $303 million have been received under these programs.Phillips 66 Partners primarily used these net proceeds to fund the cash portion of acquisitions of assets from Phillips 66 and for capital spending and investments. See Note 27—Phillips 66 Partners LP, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information regarding Phillips 66 Partners.50Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsTransfers of Equity InterestsGray Oak Pipeline, LLC was formed to develop and construct the Gray Oak Pipeline, which transports crude oil from the Permian and Eagle Ford to Texas Gulf Coast destinations that include Corpus Christi, Texas, and the Sweeny area, including our Sweeny Refinery. Phillips 66 Partners has a consolidated holding company that owns 65% of Gray Oak Pipeline, LLC. In December 2018, a third party acquired a 35% interest in the holding company. Because the holding company’s sole asset was its ownership interest in Gray Oak Pipeline, LLC, which was considered a financial asset, and because certain restrictions were placed on the third party’s ability to transfer or sell its interest in the holding company during the construction of the Gray Oak Pipeline, the legal sale of the 35% interest did not qualify as a sale under GAAP at that time. The Gray Oak Pipeline commenced full operations in the second quarter of 2020, and the restrictions placed on the co-venturer were lifted on June 30, 2020, resulting in the recognition of the sale under GAAP. Accordingly, at June 30, 2020, the co-venturer’s 35% interest in the holding company was recharacterized from a long-term obligation to a noncontrolling interest on our consolidated balance sheet, and the premium of $84 million previously paid by the co-venturer in 2019 was recharacterized from a long-term obligation to a gain in our consolidated statement of operations. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the co-venturer contributed an aggregate of $61 million to the holding company to fund its portion of Gray Oak Pipeline, LLC’s cash calls. Phillips 66 Partners’ effective ownership interest in Gray Oak Pipeline, LLC is 42.25% , after considering the co-venturer’s 35% interest in the consolidated holding company. See Note 6—Investments, Loans and Long-Term Receivables, for further discussion regarding Phillips 66 Partners’ investment in Gray Oak Pipeline, LLC.Revolving Credit Facilities and Commercial PaperPhillips 66 has a $5 billion revolving credit facility which may be used for direct bank borrowings, as support for issuances of letters of credit, and as support for our commercial paper program. We have an option to increase the overall capacity to $6 billion, subject to certain conditions. We also have the option to extend the scheduled maturity of the facility for up to two additional one-year terms after its July 30, 2024, maturity date, subject to, among other things, the consent of the lenders holding the majority of the commitments and of each lender extending its commitment. The facility is with a broad syndicate of financial institutions and contains covenants that are usual and customary for an agreement of this type, including a maximum consolidated net debt-to-capitalization ratio of 65% as of the last day of each fiscal quarter. The facility has customary events of default, such as nonpayment of principal when due; nonpayment of interest, fees or other amounts; and violation of covenants. Outstanding borrowings under the facility bear interest, at our option, at either: (a) the Eurodollar rate in effect from time to time plus the applicable margin; or (b) the reference rate (as described in the facility) plus the applicable margin. The facility also provides for customary fees, including commitment fees. The pricing levels for the commitment fees and interest-rate margins are determined based on the ratings in effect for Phillips 66’s senior unsecured long-term debt from time to time. Phillips 66 may at any time prepay outstanding borrowings under the facility, in whole or in part, without premium or penalty. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, no amount had been drawn under the facility. Phillips 66 also has a $5 billion uncommitted commercial paper program for short-term working capital needs that is supported by our revolving credit facility. Commercial paper maturities are contractually limited to 365 days. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, no borrowings were outstanding under the program. 51Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsPhillips 66 Partners has a $750 million revolving credit facility which may be used for direct bank borrowings and as support for issuances of letters of credit.

The pricing levels for the commitment fees and interest-rate margins are determined based on Phillips 66 Partners’ credit ratings in effect from time to time. Borrowings under this facility may be short-term or long-term in duration, and Phillips 66 Partners may at any time prepay outstanding borrowings under the facility, in whole or in part, without premium or penalty. At December 31, 2020, borrowings of $415 million were outstanding under this facility, compared with no borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2019. At both December 31, 2020 and 2019, $1 million in letters of credit had been issued that were supported by this facility. We had approximately $5.3 billion and $5.7 billion of total committed capacity available under our revolving credit facilities at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Other Debt Issuances and FinancingsSenior Unsecured NotesOn November 18, 2020, Phillips 66 closed its public offering of $1.75 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes consisting of:•$450 million aggregate principal amount of Floating Rate Senior Notes due 2024 (the Floating Rate Notes).•$800 million aggregate principal amount of 0.900% Senior Notes due 2024.•$500 million aggregate principal amount of 1.300% Senior Notes due 2026.The Floating Rate Notes will bear interest at a floating rate, reset quarterly, equal to the three-month London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus 0.62% per year, subject to adjustment. Interest on the Senior Notes due 2024 and 2026 is payable semiannually on February 15 and August 15 of each year, commencing on February 15, 2021. Proceeds received from the public offering of senior unsecured notes on November 18, 2020, were $1.74 billion, net of underwriters’ discounts and commissions, as well as debt issuance costs. On November 19, 2020, a portion of these proceeds were used to repay $500 million of outstanding borrowings under the term loan facility that Phillips 66 entered into in March 2020 (see the “Term Loan Facility” section below for a full description of the term loan facility). In addition, a portion of the proceeds will be used to repay the $500 million aggregate principal amount of our outstanding Floating Rate Senior Notes due February 2021. The remainder of the proceeds are being used for general corporate purposes. 52Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsOn June 10, 2020, Phillips 66 closed its public offering of $1 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes consisting of:•$150 million aggregate principal amount of 3.850% Senior Notes due 2025.•$850 million aggregate principal amount of 2.150% Senior Notes due 2030.On April 9, 2020, Phillips 66 closed its public offering of $1 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes consisting of:•$500 million aggregate principal amount of 3.700% Senior Notes due 2023.•$500 million aggregate principal amount of 3.850% Senior Notes due 2025. Interest on the Senior Notes due 2023 is payable semiannually on April 6 and October 6 of each year, commencing on October 6, 2020. The Senior Notes due 2025 issued on June 10, 2020, constitute a further issuance of the Senior Notes due 2025 originally issued on April 9, 2020. The $650 million in aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes due 2025 is treated as a single class of debt securities. Interest on the Senior Notes due 2025 is payable semiannually on April 9 and October 9 of each year, commencing on October 9, 2020. Interest on the Senior Notes due 2030 is payable semiannually on June 15 and December 15 of each year, commencing on December 15, 2020.Proceeds received from the public offerings of senior unsecured notes on June 10, 2020, and April 9, 2020, were $1,008 million and $993 million, respectively, net of underwriters’ discounts or premiums and commissions, as well as debt issuance costs. These proceeds are being used for general corporate purposes. Term Loan FacilityOn March 19, 2020, Phillips 66 entered into a $1 billion 364-day delayed draw term loan agreement (the Facility) and borrowed $1 billion under the Facility shortly thereafter. On April 6, 2020, Phillips 66 increased the size of the Facility to $2 billion, and in June 2020, the Facility was amended to extend the commitment period to September 19, 2020. We did not draw additional amounts under the Facility before the end of the commitment period or further extend the commitment period. In November 2020, we repaid $500 million of borrowings outstanding under the Facility, and the Facility was amended to extend the maturity date of the remaining $500 million outstanding borrowings from March 18, 2021, to November 20, 2023. Borrowings under the Facility bear interest at a floating rate based on either the Eurodollar rate or the reference rate, plus a margin determined by the credit rating of Phillips 66’s senior unsecured long-term debt. Phillips 66 is using the proceeds for general corporate purposes. Availability of Debt FinancingWe have a BBB+ credit rating, with a negative outlook, from Standard & Poor’s and an A3 credit rating, with a negative outlook, from Moody’s Investors Service. These investment grade ratings have served to lower our borrowing costs and facilitate access to a variety of lenders. We do not have any ratings triggers on any of our corporate debt that would cause an automatic default, and thereby impact our access to liquidity, in the event of a rating downgrade. Failure to maintain strong investment grade ratings could prohibit us from accessing the commercial paper market, although we would expect to be able to access funds under our liquidity facilities mentioned above.53Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsOff-Balance Sheet ArrangementsLease Residual Value GuaranteesIn September 2020, we amended the operating lease agreement for our headquarters facility in Houston, Texas, and extended the lease term from June 2021 to September 2025. Under this agreement, we have the option, at the end of the lease term, to request to renew the lease, purchase the facility or assist the lessor in marketing it for resale. We have a residual value guarantee associated with the operating lease agreement with a maximum potential future exposure of $514 million at December 31, 2020. We also have residual value guarantees associated with railcar and airplane leases with maximum potential future payments totaling $381 million. These operating leases have remaining terms of up to nine years. Dakota Access, LLC (Dakota Access) and Energy Transfer Crude Oil Company, LLC (ETCO)In March 2019, a wholly owned subsidiary of Dakota Access closed an offering of $2.5 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes, consisting of:•$650 million aggregate principal amount of 3.625% Senior Notes due 2022. •$1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 3.900% Senior Notes due 2024. •$850 million aggregate principal amount of 4.625% Senior Notes due 2029.Dakota Access and ETCO have guaranteed repayment of the notes. In addition, Phillips 66 Partners and its coventurers in Dakota Access provided a Contingent Equity Contribution Undertaking (CECU) in conjunction with the notes offering. Under the CECU, the co-venturers may be severally required to make proportionate equity contributions to Dakota Access if there is an unfavorable final judgment in the ongoing litigation related to an easement granted by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) to allow the pipeline to be constructed under Lake Oahe in North Dakota. Contributions may be required if Dakota Access determines that the issues included in any such final judgment cannot be remediated and Dakota Access has or is projected to have insufficient funds to satisfy repayment of the notes. If Dakota Access undertakes remediation to cure issues raised in a final judgment, contributions may be required if any series of the notes become due, whether by acceleration or at maturity, during such time, to the extent Dakota Access has or is projected to have insufficient funds to pay such amounts. At December 31, 2020, Phillips 66 Partners’ share of the maximum potential equity contributions under the CECU was approximately $631 million and the aggregate book value of Phillips 66 Partners’ investments in Dakota Access and ETCO was $577 million.In March 2020, the trial court presiding over this litigation ordered the USACE to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) and requested additional information to enable a decision on whether the Dakota Access Pipeline should be shut down while the EIS is being prepared. In July 2020, the trial court ordered the Dakota Access Pipeline to be shut down and emptied of crude oil within 30 days and that the pipeline should remain shut down pending the preparation of the EIS by the USACE, which the USACE has indicated is expected to take approximately 13 months. Dakota Access filed an appeal and a request for a stay of the order, which was granted. In January 2021, the appellate court affirmed the trial court’s order that: (1) vacated Dakota Access’s easement under Lake Oahe, and (2) directed the USACE to prepare an EIS. The appellate court did not affirm the trial court’s order that the Dakota Access Pipeline be shut down and emptied of crude oil. However, the appellate court acknowledged the precise consequences of the vacated easement remain uncertain. Since the pipeline is now an encroachment, the USACE could seek a shutdown of the pipeline during the preparation of the EIS. Alternatively, the trial court could again issue an injunction that the pipeline be shut down, assuming it makes all findings necessary for injunctive relief. A status hearing is scheduled for April 9, 2021, at which time the parties will discuss the appellate court’s decision and how the USACE plans to proceed given the vacating of the easement. If the pipeline is required to cease operations pending the preparation of the EIS, and should Dakota Access and ETCO not have sufficient funds to pay ongoing expenses, Phillips 66 Partners also could be required to support its share of the ongoing expenses, including scheduled interest payments on the notes of approximately $25 million annually, in addition to the potential obligations under the CECU.54Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsGray Oak Pipeline, LLCGray Oak Pipeline, LLC had a third-party term loan facility with a borrowing capacity of $1,379 million, inclusive of accrued interest. Phillips 66 Partners and its co-venturers provided a guarantee through an equity contribution agreement requiring proportionate equity contributions to Gray Oak Pipeline, LLC up to the total outstanding loan amount, plus any additional accrued interest and associated fees, if Gray Oak Pipeline, LLC defaulted on certain of its obligations thereunder. In September 2020, Gray Oak Pipeline, LLC fully repaid the outstanding balance of the term loan facility, and the associated equity contribution agreement was terminated. See Note 13—Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information on our guarantees.55Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsCapital RequirementsCapital Expenditures and InvestmentsFor information about our capital expenditures and investments, see the “Capital Spending” section below. Debt FinancingOur debt balance at December 31, 2020, was $15.9 billion and our total debt-to-capital ratio was 42%. See Note 12—Debt, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for our annual debt maturities over the next five years and more information on debt repayments.Debt Incurred During 2020As noted in “Significant Sources of Capital,” Phillips 66 received approximately $4.7 billion in proceeds from debt issuances during 2020, while repaying approximately $1.0 billion of debt. Phillips 66 Partners had net borrowings of $415 million under its revolving credit facility during 2020. The net increase in debt of $4.1 billion reflects our response to the COVID-19 pandemic’s negative impacts on our operating cash flows. As economic conditions improve and our operating cash flows return to more typical levels, we will continue to prioritize funding sustaining capital expenditures and the company’s dividend. After these cash flow needs, we expect to prioritize repayment of debt, with an objective of maintaining our investment grade credit ratings and reducing our debt to pre-pandemic levels. We intentionally structured the maturities and call options of our debt issued in 2020 to facilitate these objectives. Additionally, restarting our share repurchase program remains a priority once operating cash flows exceed amounts needed to fulfill the other priorities stated above and assuming our shares are trading below intrinsic value.Joint Venture LoansDuring 2020, we and our co-venturer provided member loans to WRB. At December 31, 2020, our share of the loan balance was $277 million. The need for additional loans to WRB in 2021, as well as WRB’s repayment schedule, will depend on market conditions.DividendsOn February 10, 2021, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.90 per common share, payable March 1, 2021, to holders of record at the close of business on February 22, 2021. We expect that our Board of Directors will continue to declare quarterly dividends in 2021. Share RepurchasesSince July 2012, our Board of Directors has authorized an aggregate of $15 billion of repurchases of our outstanding common stock. The authorizations do not have expiration dates. The share repurchases are expected to be funded primarily through available cash. We are not obligated to repurchase any shares of common stock pursuant to these authorizations and may commence, suspend or terminate repurchases at any time. Since the inception of our share repurchase program in 2012, we have repurchased 159 million shares at an aggregate cost of $12.5 billion. Shares of stock repurchased are held as treasury shares. We suspended share repurchases in mid-March 2020 to preserve liquidity in response to the global economic disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.56Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsContractual ObligationsThe following table summarizes our aggregate contractual fixed and variable obligations as of December 31, 2020:Millions of DollarsPayments Due by Period TotalUp to1 YearYears2-3Years4-5After5 YearsDebt obligations (a)$15,716 965 3,000 2,700 9,051 Finance lease obligations264 16 30 32 186 Software obligations19 6 10 3 — Total debt15,999 987 3,040 2,735 9,237 Interest on debt7,434 568 998 866 5,002 Operating lease obligations1,372 406 455 240 271 Purchase obligations (b)76,887 28,946 9,742 8,099 30,100 Other long-term liabilities (c)Asset retirement obligations309 9 40 29 231 Accrued environmental costs427 70 131 65 161 Repatriation income tax liability (d)88 9 27 52 — Total$102,516 30,995 14,433 12,086 45,002 (a)For additional information, see Note 12—Debt, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.(b)Represents any agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable, legally binding and specifies all significant terms. We expect these purchase obligations will be fulfilled with operating cash flows in the applicable maturity period. The majority of the purchase obligations are market-based contracts, including exchanges and futures, for the purchase of products such as crude oil and raw NGL. The products are used to supply our refineries and fractionators and optimize our supply chain. Product purchase commitments with third parties totaled $29,551 million. Related party purchase commitments totaled $31,729 million and included purchases from CPChem, DCP Midstream and other equity affiliates. Purchase obligations of $4,027 million are related to agreements to access and utilize the capacity of third-party equipment and facilities, including pipelines and product terminals, to transport, process, treat, and store products. The remainder is primarily our net share of purchase commitments for materials and services for jointly owned facilities where we are the operator.(c)Excludes pensions and unrecognized income tax benefits. From 2021 through 2025, we expect to contribute an average of $125 million per year to our qualified and nonqualified pension and other postretirement benefit plans in the United States and an average of $30 million per year to our non-U.S. plans. The U.S. five-year average consists of approximately $40 million for 2021 and $145 million per year for the remaining four years. Our minimum funding in 2021 is expected to be $40 million in the United States and $30 million outside the United States. This amount also excludes unrecognized tax benefits of $56 million because the ultimate disposition and timing of any tax payments to be made with regard to such amounts are not reasonably estimable or the amounts relate to potential refunds. This amount also excludes interest of $5 million. Although unrecognized tax benefits are not a contractual obligation, they represent potential demands on our liquidity. (d)We elected to pay the one-time deemed repatriation income tax on foreign-sourced earnings, recognized as a result of the Tax Act enacted in December 2017, in installments over eight years beginning in 2018. The amount represents the remaining income tax liability. 57Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsCapital Spending Our capital expenditures and investments represent consolidated capital spending. Our adjusted capital spending is a non-GAAP financial measure that demonstrates our net share of capital spending, and reflects an adjustment for the portion of our consolidated capital spending funded by certain joint venture partners.

During 2020, Phillips 66 commenced operations of two new NGL fractionators (Frac 2 and Frac 3) at the Sweeny Hub in Texas. •Contributions by Phillips 66 Partners to fund the Gray Oak Pipeline project and South Texas Gateway Terminal development activities.•Construction activities on Phillips 66 Partners’ C2G Pipeline that will connect its Clemens Caverns storage facility to petrochemical facilities in Gregory, Texas.•Contributions to joint ventures to develop and construct crude oil pipeline systems, including the Liberty Pipeline system.•Construction activities to increase storage and export capacity at our Beaumont Terminal.•Construction of Phillips 66 Partners’ Sweeny to Pasadena refined petroleum product pipeline. •Construction of Phillips 66 Partners’ new isomerization unit at the Lake Charles Refinery. •Contributions to Bayou Bridge Pipeline, LLC, a Phillips 66 Partners’ 40 percent-owned joint venture, for the construction of a pipeline from Nederland, Texas, to Lake Charles, Louisiana, and a pipeline segment from Lake Charles to St. James, Louisiana. •Spending associated with other return, reliability and maintenance projects in our Transportation and NGL businesses.58Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsIn March 2020, the development and construction of our Red Oak Pipeline system and Sweeny Frac 4, as well as Phillips 66 Partners’ Liberty Pipeline system projects, were deferred as a result of the challenging business environment. In the third quarter of 2020, the Red Oak Pipeline project was canceled. We plan to resume construction of Sweeny Frac 4 in the second half of 2021.During the three-year period ended December 31, 2020, DCP Midstream’s self-funded capital expenditures and investments were $2.1 billion on a 100% basis. Capital spending during this period was primarily for expansion projects and maintenance capital expenditures for existing assets. Expansion projects included construction of the Latham II offload facilities, the Cheyenne Connector, and the Mewbourn 3 and O’Connor 2 plants, as well as investments in the Sand Hills, Southern Hills and Gulf Coast Express pipeline joint ventures.ChemicalsDuring the three-year period ended December 31, 2020, CPChem had a self-funded capital program that totaled $2.0 billion on a 100% basis. The capital spending was primarily for the development of U.S. Gulf Coast petrochemical projects, debottlenecking projects on existing assets, and the development of a petrochemicals complex in Qatar.RefiningCapital spending for the Refining segment during the three-year period ended December 31, 2020, was $2.6 billion, primarily for refinery upgrade projects to enhance the yield of high-value products, renewable diesel projects, improvements to the operating integrity of key processing units, and safety-related projects. Key projects completed during the three-year period included: •Installation of facilities to improve clean product yield at the Bayway and Lake Charles refineries, as well as the jointly owned Borger and Wood River refineries.•Installation of facilities to improve product value at the Bayway and Sweeny refineries.•Installation of facilities to improve processing of advantaged crude at the Lake Charles refinery.•Installation of facilities to comply with the EPA Tier 3 gasoline regulations at the Bayway and Ferndale refineries.Marketing and SpecialtiesCapital spending for the M&S segment during the three-year period ended December 31, 2020, was primarily for an investment in a U.S. West Coast retail marketing joint venture, and the acquisition, development and enhancement of retail sites in Europe. Corporate and OtherCapital spending for Corporate and Other during the three-year period ended December 31, 2020, was primarily for information technology and facilities.59Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements2021 BudgetOur 2021 capital budget is $1.7 billion, including $305 million of Phillips 66 Partners’ planned capital spending. Our projected $1.7 billion capital budget excludes our portion of planned capital spending by our major joint ventures DCP Midstream, CPChem and WRB totaling $707 million. Phillips 66 Partners’ planned capital spending of $305 million includes $5 million of capital expected to be funded by a joint venture partner.The Midstream capital budget is $615 million, of which $5 million is expected to be funded by a joint venture partner. The Midstream growth capital budget is directed toward completing near-term committed and optimization projects, including the construction of Sweeny Frac 4 and the completion of the C2G Pipeline. Sustaining capital will be used to enhance asset integrity and reliability. Refining’s capital budget of $776 million includes $521 million of sustaining capital for reliability, safety and environmental projects. The Refining budget includes $255 million for high-return, quick-payout projects to enhance margins by improving clean product yields and reducing feedstock costs, as well as investments to competitively position the company for a lower carbon future. The Refining budget also includes pre-construction engineering and design costs related to the company’s plans to reconfigure the San Francisco Refinery in Rodeo, California, to produce renewable fuels. The M&S capital budget of $116 million primarily reflects the development and improvement of our international retail sites. The Corporate and Other capital budget of $166 million will primarily fund digital transformation projects, including a new enterprise resource planning system.60Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsContingenciesA number of lawsuits involving a variety of claims that arose in the ordinary course of business have been filed against us or are subject to indemnifications provided by us. We also may be required to remove or mitigate the effects on the environment of the placement, storage, disposal or release of certain chemical, mineral and petroleum substances at various active and inactive sites. We regularly assess the need for financial recognition or disclosure of these contingencies. In the case of all known contingencies (other than those related to income taxes), we accrue a liability when the loss is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable. If a range of amounts can be reasonably estimated and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount, then the minimum of the range is accrued. We do not reduce these liabilities for potential insurance or third-party recoveries. If applicable, we accrue receivables for probable insurance or other third-party recoveries. In the case of income tax-related contingencies, we use a cumulative probability-weighted loss accrual in cases where sustaining a tax position is less than certain.Based on currently available information, we believe it is remote that future costs related to known contingent liability exposures will exceed current accruals by an amount that would have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements. As we learn new facts concerning contingencies, we reassess our position both with respect to accrued liabilities and other potential exposures. Estimates particularly sensitive to future changes include contingent liabilities recorded for environmental remediation, tax and legal matters. Estimated future environmental remediation costs are subject to change due to such factors as the uncertain magnitude of cleanup costs, the unknown time and extent of such remedial actions that may be required, and the determination of our liability in proportion to that of other potentially responsible parties. Estimated future costs related to tax and legal matters are subject to change as events evolve and as additional information becomes available during the administrative and litigation processes.Legal and Tax MattersOur legal and tax matters are handled by our legal and tax organizations. These organizations apply their knowledge, experience and professional judgment to the specific characteristics of our cases and uncertain tax positions. We employ a litigation management process to manage and monitor the legal proceedings. Our process facilitates the early evaluation and quantification of potential exposures in individual cases and enables the tracking of those cases that have been scheduled for trial and/or mediation. Based on professional judgment and experience in using these litigation management tools and available information about current developments in all our cases, our legal organization regularly assesses the adequacy of current accruals and determines if adjustment of existing accruals, or establishment of new accruals, is required. In the case of income tax-related contingencies, we monitor tax legislation and court decisions, the status of tax audits and the statute of limitations within which a taxing authority can assert a liability. See Note 21—Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information about income tax-related contingencies.EnvironmentalWe are subject to international, federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. Among the most significant of these international and federal environmental laws and regulations are the: •U.S. Federal Clean Air Act, which governs air emissions.•U.S. Federal Clean Water Act, which governs discharges into water bodies.•European Union Regulation for Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH), which governs production, marketing and use of chemicals.•U.S. Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), which imposes liability on generators, transporters and arrangers of hazardous substances at sites where hazardous substance releases have occurred or are threatening to occur.•U.S. Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), which governs the treatment, storage and disposal of solid waste.•U.S. Federal Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA), which requires facilities to report toxic chemical inventories to local emergency planning committees and response departments.61Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements•U.S. Federal Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA90), under which owners and operators of onshore facilities and pipelines as well as owners and operators of vessels are liable for removal costs and damages that result from a discharge of oil into navigable waters of the United States.•European Union Trading Directive resulting in the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS), which uses a market-based mechanism to incentivize the reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, as well as the United Kingdom Emissions Trading Scheme (UK ETS), which will replace the EU ETS in the United Kingdom beginning April 30, 2021.These laws and their implementing regulations set limits on emissions and, in the case of discharges to water, establish water quality limits. They also, in most cases, require permits in association with new or modified operations. These permits can require an applicant to collect substantial information in connection with the application process, which can be expensive and time consuming. In addition, there can be delays associated with notice and comment periods and the agency’s processing of the application. Many of the delays associated with the permitting process are beyond the control of the applicant.Other foreign countries and many states where we operate also have, or are developing, similar environmental laws and regulations governing these same types of activities. While similar, in some cases these regulations may impose additional, or more stringent, requirements that can add to the cost and difficulty of developing infrastructure and marketing and transporting products across state and international borders. For example, in California the South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD) approved amendments to the Regional Clean Air Incentives Market (RECLAIM) that became effective in 2016, which require a phased reduction of nitrogen oxide emissions through 2022, affecting refineries in the Los Angeles metropolitan area. In 2017, SCAQMD required additional nitrogen dioxide emissions reductions through 2025 and is now promulgating new regulations to replace the RECLAIM program with a traditional command and control regulatory regime.The ultimate financial impact arising from environmental laws and regulations is neither clearly known nor easily determinable as new standards, such as air emission standards, water quality standards and stricter fuel regulations, continue to evolve. However, environmental laws and regulations, including those that may arise to address concerns about global climate change, are expected to continue to have an increasing impact on our operations in the United States and in other countries in which we operate. Notable areas of potential impacts include air emissions compliance and remediation obligations in the United States.An example of this in the fuels area is the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA). It requires fuel producers and importers to provide additional renewable fuels for transportation motor fuels and stipulates a mix of various types. RINs form the mechanism used by the EPA to record compliance with the Renewable Fuel Standard. If an obligated party has more RINs than it needs to meet its obligation, it may sell or trade the extra RINs, or instead choose to “bank” them for use the following year. We have met the stringent requirements to date while establishing implementation, operating and capital strategies, along with advanced technology development, to address projected future requirements. It is uncertain how various future requirements contained in EISA, and the regulations promulgated thereunder, may be implemented and what their full impact may be on our operations. For the 2020 compliance year, the EPA set volumes of advanced and total renewable fuels required to be blended into transportation fuels at higher levels than in previous years; it is uncertain if these increased obligations will be achievable by fuel producers and shippers without drawing on the RIN bank. Additionally, we may experience a decrease in demand for refined petroleum products due to the regulatory program as currently promulgated. This program continues to be the subject of possible Congressional review and re-promulgation in revised form, and the EPA’s regulations pertaining to the 2019 and 2020 compliance years are subject to legal challenge, further creating uncertainty regarding renewable fuel volume requirements and obligations. Uncertainty also exists surrounding compliance year 2021, as the EPA has not yet promulgated standards for that compliance year, although we expect the EPA to follow its past practice of using its authority to reduce the statutorily required volumes under EISA of advanced and total renewable fuels required to be blended into transportation fuels. Compliance with the regulation has been further complicated as the market for RINs has been the subject of fraudulent third-party activity, and it is possible that some RINs that we have purchased may be determined to be invalid. Should that occur, we could incur costs to replace those fraudulent RINs. Although the cost for replacing any fraudulently marketed RINs is not reasonably estimable at this time, we would not expect such costs to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition.62Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsWe also are subject to certain laws and regulations relating to environmental remediation obligations associated with current and past operations. Such laws and regulations include CERCLA and RCRA and their state equivalents. Remediation obligations include cleanup responsibility arising from petroleum releases from underground storage tanks located at numerous previously and currently owned and/or operated petroleum-marketing outlets throughout the United States. Federal and state laws require contamination caused by such underground storage tank releases be assessed and remediated to meet applicable standards. In addition to other cleanup standards, many states have adopted cleanup criteria for methyl tertiary-butyl ether (MTBE) for both soil and groundwater.At RCRA-permitted facilities, we are required to assess environmental conditions. If conditions warrant, we may be required to remediate contamination caused by prior operations. In contrast to CERCLA, which is often referred to as “Superfund,” the cost of corrective action activities under RCRA corrective action programs typically is borne solely by us. We anticipate increased expenditures for RCRA remediation activities may be required, but such annual expenditures for the near term are not expected to vary significantly from the range of such expenditures we have experienced over the past few years. Longer-term expenditures are subject to considerable uncertainty and may fluctuate significantly.We occasionally receive requests for information or notices of potential liability from the EPA and state environmental agencies alleging that we are a potentially responsible party under CERCLA or an equivalent state statute. On occasion, we also have been made a party to cost recovery litigation by those agencies or by private parties. These requests, notices and lawsuits assert potential liability for remediation costs at various sites that typically are not owned by us, but allegedly contain wastes attributable to our past operations. As of December 31, 2019, we reported that we had been notified of potential liability under CERCLA and comparable state laws at 27 sites within the United States. During 2020, we were notified of one previously resolved site that was returned to active status and three sites that were deemed resolved and closed, leaving 25 unresolved sites with potential liability at December 31, 2020. For the majority of Superfund sites, our potential liability will be less than the total site remediation costs because the percentage of waste attributable to us, versus that attributable to all other potentially responsible parties, is relatively low. Although liability of those potentially responsible is generally joint and several for federal sites and frequently so for state sites, other potentially responsible parties at sites where we are a party typically have had the financial strength to meet their obligations, and where they have not, or where potentially responsible parties could not be located, our share of liability has not increased materially. Many of the sites for which we are potentially responsible are still under investigation by the EPA or the state agencies concerned. Prior to actual cleanup, those potentially responsible normally assess site conditions, apportion responsibility and determine the appropriate remediation. In some instances, we may have no liability or attain a settlement of liability. Actual cleanup costs generally occur after the parties obtain the EPA or equivalent state agency approval of a remediation plan. There are relatively few sites where we are a major participant, and given the timing and amounts of anticipated expenditures, neither the cost of remediation at those sites nor such costs at all CERCLA sites, in the aggregate, is expected to have a material adverse effect on our competitive or financial condition.Expensed environmental costs were $610 million in 2020 and are expected to be approximately $720 million per year in 2021 and 2022. Capitalized environmental costs were $131 million in 2020 and are expected to be approximately $105 million and $140 million, in 2021 and 2022, respectively. These amounts do not include capital expenditures made for other purposes that have an indirect benefit on environmental compliance.Accrued liabilities for remediation activities are not reduced for potential recoveries from insurers or other third parties and are not discounted (except those assumed in a business combination, which we record on a discounted basis).Many of these liabilities result from CERCLA, RCRA and similar state laws that require us to undertake certain investigative and remedial activities at sites where we conduct, or once conducted, operations or at sites where our generated waste was disposed. We also have accrued for a number of sites we identified that may require environmental remediation, but which are not currently the subject of CERCLA, RCRA or state enforcement activities. If applicable, we accrue receivables for probable insurance or other third-party recoveries. In the future, we may incur significant costs under both CERCLA and RCRA. Remediation activities vary substantially in duration and cost from site to site, depending on the mix of unique site characteristics, evolving remediation technologies, diverse regulatory agencies and enforcement policies, and the presence or absence of potentially liable third parties. Therefore, it is difficult to develop reasonable estimates of future site remediation costs.63Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsNotwithstanding any of the foregoing, and as with other companies engaged in similar businesses, environmental costs and liabilities are inherent concerns in certain of our operations and products, and there can be no assurance that those costs and liabilities will not be material. However, we currently do not expect any material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position as a result of compliance with current environmental laws and regulations.Climate ChangeThere has been a broad range of proposed or promulgated state, national and international laws focusing on GHG emissions reduction, including various regulations proposed or issued by the EPA. These proposed or promulgated laws apply or could apply in states and/or countries where we have interests or may have interests in the future. Laws regulating GHG emissions continue to evolve, and while it is not possible to accurately estimate either a timetable for implementation or our future compliance costs relating to implementation, such laws potentially could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition as a result of increasing costs of compliance, lengthening project implementation and agency reviews, or reducing demand for certain hydrocarbon products. Examples of legislation or precursors for possible regulation that do or could affect our operations include: •EU ETS, which is part of the European Union’s policy to combat climate change and is a key tool for reducing industrial GHG emissions. EU ETS impacts factories, power stations and other installations across all EU member states. As a result of the United Kingdom’s exit from the European Union (BREXIT), those types of entities in the United Kingdom will be subject to the UK ETS, rather than the EU ETS, beginning April 30, 2021. •California’s Senate Bill No. 32, which requires reduction of California's GHG emissions to 40% below the 1990 emission level by 2030, and Assembly Bill 398, which extends the California GHG emission cap and trade program through 2030. Other GHG emissions programs in the western U.S. states have been enacted or are under consideration or development, including amendments to California's Low Carbon Fuel Standard, Oregon's Low Carbon Fuel Standard, and Washington's carbon reduction programs.•The U.S. Supreme Court decision in Massachusetts v. EPA, 549 U.S. 497, 127 S. Ct. 1438 (2007), confirming that the EPA has the authority to regulate carbon dioxide as an “air pollutant” under the Federal Clean Air Act.•The EPA’s announcement on March 29, 2010 (published as “Interpretation of Regulations that Determine Pollutants Covered by Clean Air Act Permitting Programs,” 75 Fed. Reg. 17004 (April 2, 2010)), and the EPA’s and U.S. Department of Transportation’s joint promulgation of a Final Rule on April 1, 2010, that triggers regulation of GHGs under the Clean Air Act. These collectively may lead to more climate-based claims for damages, and may result in longer agency review time for development projects to determine the extent of potential climate change. •The EPA's 2015 Final Rule regulating GHG emissions from existing fossil fuel-fired electrical generating units under the Federal Clean Air Act, commonly referred to as the Clean Power Plan. The EPA commenced rulemaking in 2017 to rescind the Clean Power Plan and, in August 2018, the EPA proposed the Affordable Clean Energy (ACE) rule as its replacement. On January 19, 2021, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia invalidated the ACE rule and remanded the matter to the EPA, essentially restarting this rulemaking process. •Carbon taxes in certain jurisdictions.•GHG emission cap and trade programs in certain jurisdictions.In the EU, the first phase of the EU ETS completed at the end of 2007. Phase II was undertaken from 2008 through 2012, and Phase III ran from 2013 through to 2020. Phase IV runs from January 1, 2021 through 2030 and sectors covered under the ETS must reduce their GHG emissions by 43% compared to 2005 levels. From April 30, 2021, the United Kingdom will no longer be part of the EU ETS and has launched the UK ETS. Phillips 66 has assets that are subject to the EU ETS and assets that will be subject to the UK ETS.64Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsFrom November 30 to December 12, 2015, more than 190 countries, including the United States, participated in the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris, France. The conference culminated in what is known as the “Paris Agreement,” which, upon certain conditions being met, entered into force on November 4, 2016. The Paris Agreement establishes a commitment by signatory parties to pursue domestic GHG emission reductions. In 2017, President Trump announced his intention to withdraw the United States from the Paris Agreement and that withdrawal became effective on November 4, 2020. On January 20, 2021, President Biden signed the “Acceptance on Behalf of the United States of America,” which allows the United States to rejoin the Paris Agreement. The United States officially rejoined the Paris Agreement in February 2021, which could lead to additional GHG emission reduction requirements for sources in the United States.In the United States, some additional form of regulation is likely to be forthcoming in the future at the state or federal levels with respect to GHG emissions. Such regulation could take any of several forms that may result in additional financial burden in the form of taxes, the restriction of output, investments of capital to maintain compliance with laws and regulations, or required acquisition or trading of emission allowances. Compliance with changes in laws and regulations that create a GHG emission trading program, GHG reduction requirements or carbon taxes could significantly increase our costs, reduce demand for fossil energy derived products, impact the cost and availability of capital and increase our exposure to litigation. Such laws and regulations could also increase demand for less carbon intensive energy sources. An example of one such program is California’s cap and trade program, which was promulgated pursuant to the State’s Global Warming Solutions Act. The program had been limited to certain stationary sources, which include our refineries in California, but beginning in January 2015 was expanded to include emissions from transportation fuels distributed in California. Inclusion of transportation fuels in California’s cap and trade program as currently promulgated has increased our cap and trade program compliance costs. The ultimate impact on our financial performance, either positive or negative, from this and similar programs, will depend on a number of factors, including, but not limited to: •Whether and to what extent legislation or regulation is enacted.•The nature of the legislation or regulation, such as a cap and trade system or a tax on emissions.•The GHG reductions required.•The price and availability of offsets.•The demand for, and amount and allocation of allowances.•Technological and scientific developments leading to new products or services.•Any potential significant physical effects of climate change, such as increased severe weather events, changes in sea levels and changes in temperature.•Whether, and the extent to which, increased compliance costs are ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services.We consider and take into account anticipated future GHG emissions in designing and developing major facilities and projects, and implement energy efficiency initiatives to reduce GHG emissions. Data on our GHG emissions, legal requirements regulating such emissions, and the possible physical effects of climate change on our coastal assets are incorporated into our planning, investment, and risk management decision-making. We are working to continuously improve operational and energy efficiency through resource and energy conservation throughout our operations.65Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATESThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to select appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. See Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for descriptions of our major accounting policies. Some of these accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent that there is a reasonable likelihood that materially different amounts would have been reported under different conditions, or if different assumptions had been used. The following discussion of critical accounting estimates, along with the discussion of contingencies in this report, address all important accounting areas where the nature of accounting estimates or assumptions could be material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change.Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Equity Method InvestmentsLong-lived assets used in operations are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate a possible significant deterioration in future expected cash flows. If the sum of the undiscounted expected future before-tax cash flows of an asset group is less than the carrying value, including applicable liabilities, the carrying value is written down to estimated fair value. Individual assets are grouped for impairment purposes based on a judgmental assessment of the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets. Because there usually is a lack of quoted market prices for long-lived assets, the fair value of impaired assets is typically determined using one or more of the following methods: the present value of expected future cash flows using discount rates and other assumptions believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants; a market multiple for similar assets; historical market transactions including similar assets, adjusted using principal market participant assumptions when necessary; or replacement cost adjusted for physical deterioration and economic obsolescence. The expected future cash flows used for impairment reviews and related fair value calculations are based on judgmental assessments, including future volumes, commodity prices, operating costs, margins, discount rates and capital project decisions, considering all available information at the date of review.Investments in nonconsolidated entities accounted for under the equity method are assessed for impairment when there are indicators of a loss in value, such as a lack of sustained earnings capacity or a current fair value less than the investment’s carrying amount. When it is determined that an indicated impairment is other than temporary, a charge is recognized for the difference between the investment’s carrying value and its estimated fair value. When determining whether a decline in value is other than temporary, management considers factors such as the duration and extent of the decline, the investee’s financial condition and near-term prospects, and our ability and intention to retain our investment for a period that allows for recovery. When quoted market prices are not available, the fair value is usually based on the present value of expected future cash flows using discount rates and other assumptions believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants and observed market earnings multiples of comparable companies, if appropriate. Different assumptions could affect the timing and the amount of an impairment of an investment in any period.See Note 9—Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for information about significant impairments recorded in 2020 and 2019.Asset Retirement ObligationsUnder various contracts, permits and regulations, we have legal obligations to remove tangible equipment and restore the land at the end of operations at certain operational sites. Our largest asset removal obligations involve asbestos abatement at refineries. Estimating the timing and cost of future asset removals is difficult. Most of these removal obligations are many years, or decades, in the future, and the contracts and regulations often have vague descriptions of what removal practices and criteria must be met when the removal event actually occurs. Asset removal technologies and costs, regulatory and other compliance considerations, expenditure timing, and other inputs into valuation of the obligation, including discount and inflation rates, are also subject to change.66Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsEnvironmental CostsIn addition to asset retirement obligations discussed above, we have certain obligations to complete environmental-related projects. These projects are primarily related to cleanup at domestic refineries, underground storage sites and nonoperated sites. Future environmental remediation costs are difficult to estimate because they are subject to change due to such factors as the uncertain magnitude of cleanup costs, timing and extent of such remedial actions that may be required, and the determination of our liability in proportion to that of other responsible parties.Intangible Assets and GoodwillAt December 31, 2020, we had $725 million of intangible assets that we have determined to have indefinite useful lives, and therefore do not amortize. The judgmental determination that an intangible asset has an indefinite useful life is continuously evaluated. If, due to changes in facts and circumstances, management determines these intangible assets have finite useful lives, amortization will commence at that time on a prospective basis. As long as these intangible assets are determined to have indefinite lives, they will be subject to at least annual impairment tests that require management’s judgment of their estimated fair value.At December 31, 2020, we had $1.4 billion of goodwill recorded in conjunction with past business combinations. Goodwill is not amortized. Instead, goodwill is subject to at least annual tests for impairment at a reporting unit level. A reporting unit is an operating segment or a component that is one level below an operating segment, and it is determined primarily based on the manner in which the business is managed.We perform our annual goodwill impairment test using a qualitative assessment and a quantitative assessment, if one is deemed necessary. As part of our qualitative assessment, we evaluate relevant events and circumstances that could affect the fair value of our reporting units, including macroeconomic conditions, overall industry and market considerations and regulatory changes, as well as company-specific market metrics, performance and events. The evaluation of company-specific events and circumstances includes evaluating changes in our stock price and cost of capital, actual and forecasted financial performance, as well as the effect of significant asset dispositions. If our qualitative assessment indicates it is likely the fair value of a reporting unit has declined below its carrying value (including goodwill), a quantitative assessment is performed.When a quantitative assessment is performed, management applies judgment in determining the estimated fair values of the reporting units because quoted market prices for our reporting units are not available. Management uses available information to make this fair value determination, including estimated future cash flows, cost of capital, observed market earnings multiples of comparable companies, our common stock price and associated total company market capitalization. See Note 9—Impairments, and Note 16—Fair Value Measurements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information regarding the goodwill impairment we recorded in the first quarter of 2020. We completed our annual qualitative assessment of goodwill as of October 1, 2020, and concluded that the fair values of our reporting units exceeded their respective carrying values (including goodwill). A decline in the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting units in the future could result in an impairment. As such, we continue to monitor for indicators of impairment until our next annual impairment assessment is performed. 67Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsTax Assets and LiabilitiesOur operations are subject to various taxes, including federal, state and foreign income taxes, property taxes, and transactional taxes such as excise, sales and use, value-added and payroll taxes. We record tax liabilities based on our assessment of existing tax laws and regulations. The recording of tax liabilities requires significant judgment and estimates. We recognize the financial statement effects of an income tax position when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination by a taxing authority. A contingent liability related to a transactional tax claim is recorded if the loss is both probable and reasonably estimable. Actual incurred tax liabilities can vary from our estimates for a variety of reasons, including different interpretations of tax laws and regulations and different assessments of the amount of tax due.In determining our income tax expense (benefit), we assess the likelihood our deferred tax assets will be recovered through future taxable income. Valuation allowances reduce deferred tax assets to an amount that will, more likely than not, be realized. Judgment is required in estimating the amount of valuation allowance, if any, that should be recorded against our deferred tax assets. Based on our historical taxable income, our expectations for the future, and available tax-planning strategies, we expect our net deferred tax assets will more likely than not be realized as offsets to reversing deferred tax liabilities and as reductions to future taxable income. If our actual results of operations differ from such estimates or our estimates of future taxable income change, the valuation allowance may need to be revised.New tax laws and regulations, as well as changes to existing tax laws and regulations, are continuously being proposed or promulgated. The implementation of future legislative and regulatory tax initiatives could result in increased income tax liabilities that cannot be predicted at this time.Projected Benefit Obligations Calculation of the projected benefit obligations for our defined benefit pension and postretirement plans impacts the obligations on the balance sheet and the amount of benefit expense in the statement of operations. The actuarial calculation of projected benefit obligations and company contribution requirements involves judgment about uncertain future events, including estimated retirement dates, salary levels at retirement, mortality rates, lump-sum election rates, rates of return on plan assets, future interest rates, future health care cost-trend rates, and rates of utilization of health care services by retirees. We engage outside actuarial firms to assist in the calculation of these projected benefit obligations and company contribution requirements due to the specialized nature of these calculations. As financial accounting rules and the pension plan funding regulations promulgated by governmental agencies have different objectives and requirements, the actuarial methods and assumptions for the two purposes differ in certain important respects. Ultimately, we will be required to fund all promised benefits under pension and postretirement benefit plans not funded by plan assets or investment returns, but the judgmental assumptions used in the actuarial calculations significantly affect periodic financial statements and funding patterns over time. Benefit expense is particularly sensitive to the discount rate and return on plan assets assumptions. A one percentage-point decrease in the discount rate assumption used for the plan obligation would increase annual benefit expense by an estimated $70 million, while a one percentage-point decrease in the return on plan assets assumption would increase annual benefit expense by an estimated $40 million. In determining the discount rate, we use yields on high-quality fixed income investments with payments matched to the estimated distributions of benefits from our plans.The expected weighted-average long-term rate of return for worldwide pension plan assets was approximately 6% for both 2020 and 2019, while the actual weighted-average rate of return was 12% in 2020 and 18% in 2019. For the past ten years, our actual weighted-average rate of return for worldwide pension plan assets was 9%.68Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsGUARANTOR FINANCIAL INFORMATIONAt December 31, 2020, Phillips 66 had $11 billion of senior unsecured notes outstanding guaranteed by Phillips 66 Company, a direct, wholly owned operating subsidiary of Phillips 66. Phillips 66 conducts substantially all of its operations through subsidiaries, including Phillips 66 Company, and those subsidiaries generate substantially all of its operating income and cash flow. The guarantees are (1) unsecured obligations of Phillips 66 Company, (2) rank equally with all of Phillips 66 Company’s other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness, and (3) are full and unconditional.Summarized financial information of Phillips 66 and Phillips 66 Company (the Obligor Group) is presented on a combined basis. Intercompany transactions among the members of the Obligor Group have been eliminated. The financial information of non-guarantor subsidiaries has been excluded from the summarized financial information.

The realized refining margins are adjusted to include our proportional share of our joint venture refineries’ realized margins, as well as to exclude those items that are not representative of the underlying operating performance of a period, which we call “special items.” The realized refining margins are converted to a per-barrel basis by dividing them by total refinery processed inputs (primarily crude oil) measured on a barrel basis, including our share of inputs processed by our joint venture refineries. Our realized refining margin per barrel is intended to be comparable with industry refining margins, which are known as “crack spreads.” As discussed in “Business Environment,” industry crack spreads measure the difference between market prices for refined petroleum products and crude oil. We believe realized refining margin per barrel calculated on a similar basis as industry crack spreads provides a useful measure of how well we performed relative to benchmark industry refining margins.The GAAP performance measure most directly comparable to realized refining margin per barrel is the Refining segment’s “income (loss) before income taxes per barrel.” Realized refining margin per barrel excludes items that are typically included in a manufacturer’s gross margin, such as depreciation and operating expenses, and other items used to determine income (loss) before income taxes, such as general and administrative expenses. It also includes our proportional share of joint venture refineries’ realized refining margins and excludes special items. Because realized refining margin per barrel is calculated in this manner, and because realized refining margin per barrel may be defined differently by other companies in our industry, it has limitations as an analytical tool.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKFinancial Instrument Market RiskWe and certain of our subsidiaries are exposed to market risks produced by changes in the prices of crude oil, refined petroleum products, natural gas, NGL and electric power, as well as fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. We and certain of our subsidiaries may hold and use derivative contracts to manage these risks.Commodity Price RiskGenerally, our policy is to remain exposed to the market prices of commodities. Consistent with this policy, we use derivative contracts to convert our exposure from fixed-price sales or purchase contracts, often specified in contracts with refined petroleum product customers, back to floating market prices. We also use futures, forwards, swaps and options in various markets to accomplish the following objectives:•Balance physical systems or meet our refinery requirements and market demand. In addition to cash settlement prior to contract expiration, certain exchange-traded futures may be settled by physical delivery of the underlying commodity.•Enable us to use the market knowledge gained from our physical commodity market activities to capture market opportunities, such as moving physical commodities to more profitable locations, storing commodities to capture seasonal or time premiums, and blending commodities to capture quality upgrades. Derivatives may be utilized to optimize these activities. •Manage the risk to our cash flows from price exposures on specific crude oil, refined petroleum product, natural gas and NGL transactions.These objectives optimize the value of our supply chain and may reduce our exposure to fluctuations in market prices.Our use of derivative instruments is governed by an “Authority Limitations” document approved by our Board of Directors. This document prohibits the use of highly leveraged derivatives or derivative instruments without sufficient market liquidity for comparable valuations, and establishes Value at Risk (VaR) limits. Compliance with these limits is monitored daily by our global risk group. We use a VaR model to estimate the loss in fair value that could potentially result on a single day from the effect of adverse changes in market conditions on the derivative commodity instruments held or issued. Using Monte Carlo simulation, a 95% confidence level and a one-day holding period, the VaR for derivative commodity instruments issued or held at December 31, 2020 and 2019, was immaterial to our cash flows and results of operations.74Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsInterest Rate RiskOur use of fixed- or variable-rate debt directly exposes us to interest rate risk. Fixed-rate debt, such as our senior notes, exposes us to changes in the fair value of our debt due to changes in market interest rates. Fixed-rate debt also exposes us to the risk that we may need to refinance maturing debt with new debt at higher rates, or that we may be obligated to pay rates higher than the current market. Variable-rate debt, such as our floating-rate notes or borrowings under our revolving credit facility, exposes us to short-term changes in market rates that impact our interest expense. The following tables provide information about our debt instruments that are sensitive to changes in U.S. interest rates. These tables present principal cash flows and related weighted-average interest rates by expected maturity dates. Weighted-average variable rates are based on effective rates at each reporting date. The carrying amount of our floating-rate debt approximates its fair value. The fair value of the fixed-rate financial instruments is estimated based on observable market prices.Millions of Dollars, Except as IndicatedExpected Maturity DateFixed Rate MaturityAverage Interest RateFloating Rate MaturityAverage Interest RateYear-End 20202021$— — %$965 1.05 %20222,000 4.30 — — 2023500 3.70 500 1.40 20241,100 1.32 450 0.84 20251,150 3.74 — — Remaining years9,026 4.22 25 0.76 Total$13,776 $1,940 Fair value$15,597 $1,940 Millions of Dollars, Except as IndicatedExpected Maturity DateFixed Rate MaturityAverage Interest RateFloating Rate MaturityAverage Interest RateYear-End 20192020$— — %$525 2.69 %2021— — 550 2.46 20222,000 4.30 — — 2023— — — — 2024300 2.45 — — Remaining years8,176 4.57 25 2.39 Total$10,476 $1,100 Fair value$11,813 $1,100 Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer monitor risks resulting from commodity prices, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSManagement’s Discussion and Analysis is the company’s analysis of its financial performance and financial condition, and of significant trends that may affect future performance. It should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.The terms “earnings” and “loss” as used in Management’s Discussion and Analysis refer to net income (loss) attributable to Phillips 66. The terms “results,” “before-tax income” or “before-tax loss” as used in Management’s Discussion and Analysis refer to income (loss) before income taxes. EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW AND BUSINESS ENVIRONMENTPhillips 66 is an energy manufacturing and logistics company with midstream, chemicals, refining, and marketing and specialties businesses. At December 31, 2021, we had total assets of $55.6 billion.Executive OverviewWe reported earnings of $1.3 billion and generated $6.0 billion in cash from operating activities for the full year of 2021. During 2021, we used available cash to fund capital expenditures and investments of $1.9 billion, pay dividends on our common stock of $1.6 billion, and pay down $1.5 billion in debt. We ended 2021 with $3.1 billion of cash and cash equivalents and approximately $5.7 billion of total committed capacity available under our credit facilities.Our reported earnings for 2021 continued to reflect the ongoing impacts of the disruption to global economic activities caused by the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, primarily on our Refining segment. However, through 2021 global refined petroleum product demand steadily recovered due to the easing of pandemic restrictions and the administration of COVID-19 vaccines. Consequently, margins and utilization for our Refining segment, margins and sales volumes for our Marketing and Specialities (M&S) segment, and throughput volumes for our Transportation business improved. In addition, equity earnings from our Chemicals segment increased significantly due to higher margins driven by strong demand and tight product supply. However, as uncertainty remains regarding the ongoing impact of the pandemic on the global economy, we will continue to be disciplined in our allocation of capital and monitor the performance of our portfolio. In 2021, we progressed strategic initiatives to position Phillips 66 for a lower-carbon future as a part of our commitment to play an important role in addressing climate change. In September 2021, we announced a set of company-wide greenhouse gas (GHG) emission intensity reduction targets that we consider to be impactful, attainable and measurable. By 2030, we expect to reduce GHG emission intensity by 30% for Scope 1 and 2 emissions from our operations and by 15% for Scope 3 emissions from our energy products, below 2019 levels. Also in September 2021, we acquired a 16% interest in NOVONIX Limited (NOVONIX), a company that develops technology and supplies materials for lithium-ion batteries. In October 2021, we entered into a definitive merger agreement with Phillips 66 Partners to acquire all of the limited partner interests in Phillips 66 Partners not already owned by us on the closing date of the transaction. The agreement provides for an all-stock transaction in which each outstanding Phillips 66 Partners common unitholder would receive 0.50 shares of Phillips 66 common stock for each Phillips 66 Partners common unit. Phillips 66 Partners’ perpetual convertible preferred units would be converted into common units at a premium to the original issuance price prior to exchange for Phillips 66 common stock. This merger is expected to close in March 2022, subject to customary closing conditions. Upon closing, Phillips 66 Partners will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Phillips 66 and will no longer be a publicly traded partnership. See Note 27—Phillips 66 Partners LP, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information on the pending merger transaction.38Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsWe continue to focus on the following strategic priorities:•Operating Excellence. Our commitment to operating excellence guides everything we do. We are committed to protecting the health and safety of everyone who has a role in our operations and the communities in which we operate. Continuous improvement in safety, environmental stewardship, reliability and cost efficiency is a fundamental requirement for our company and employees. We employ rigorous training and audit programs to drive ongoing improvement in both personal and process safety as we strive for zero incidents. In 2021, we achieved a 0.12 total recordable rate. Since we cannot control commodity prices, controlling operating expenses and overhead costs, within the context of our commitment to safety and environmental stewardship, is a high priority. Senior management actively monitors these costs and assesses opportunities for permanent cost reductions. We are committed to protecting the environment and strive to reduce our environmental footprint throughout our operations. Optimizing utilization rates and product yield at our refineries through reliable and safe operations enables us to capture the value available in the market in terms of prices and margins. During 2021, our worldwide refining crude oil capacity utilization rate was 84% and our worldwide refining clean product yield was 83%. •Growth. A disciplined capital allocation process ensures we invest in projects that are expected to generate competitive returns. Our strategy primarily focuses on investing in returns-focused growth opportunities in the Midstream and Chemicals segments, as well as our investments in renewable fuels projects to advance a lower-carbon future. In 2022, we have budgeted $426 million in growth capital for our Midstream segment, which includes construction completion of Frac 4 at the Sweeny Hub. In Chemicals, our share of expected self-funded growth capital spending by Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC (CPChem) is $502 million. CPChem plans to use its growth capital to fund expansion of its normal alpha olefins production, optimization and debottleneck opportunities in the olefins and polyolefins chains, as well as continuing development of petrochemicals projects in the U.S. Gulf Coast and Qatar. In Refining, we have budgeted $408 million of growth capital, primarily for the reconfiguration of the San Francisco Refinery in Rodeo, California, to a renewable fuels production facility, as part of the Rodeo Renewed project. •Returns. We plan to enhance Refining returns by increasing throughput of advantaged feedstocks, improving yields, optimizing our portfolio, and remaining committed to operating excellence. For 2022, our M&S segment will continue to develop and enhance our retail network, including energy transition opportunities. •Distributions. We believe shareholder value is enhanced through, among other things, a secure, competitive and growing dividend, complemented by share repurchases. In the fourth quarter of 2021, we increased our quarterly dividend by 2% to $0.92 per common share. Regular dividends demonstrate the confidence our Board of Directors and management have in our capital structure and operations’ capability to generate free cash flow throughout the business cycle. We suspended our share repurchase program in March 2020 to preserve liquidity. As operating cash flows improve further, we will prioritize shareholder returns and debt repayment.•High-Performing Organization. We strive to attract, develop and retain individuals with the knowledge and skills to implement our business strategy and who support our values and culture. Throughout the company, we focus on promoting an inclusive workplace that enables our diverse workforce to innovate, create value and deliver extraordinary performance. We also focus on getting results in the right way and embracing our values as a common bond, and we believe success is both what we do and how we do it. We encourage collaboration throughout our company, while valuing differences, respecting diversity, and creating a great place to work. We foster an environment of learning and development through structured programs focused on enhancing functional and technical skills where employees are engaged in our business and committed to their own, as well as the company’s, success.39Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsBusiness EnvironmentThe Midstream segment includes our Transportation and NGL businesses. Our Transportation business contains fee-based operations not directly exposed to commodity price risk. Our NGL business contains both fee-based operations and operations directly impacted by NGL prices. The Midstream segment also includes our 50% equity investment in DCP Midstream. During 2021, NGL prices increased significantly, compared with 2020, due to strong demand as economic activities gradually recovered following the administration of COVID-19 vaccines and the easing of pandemic restrictions. The Chemicals segment consists of our 50% equity investment in CPChem. The chemicals and plastics industry is mainly a commodity-based industry where the margins for key products are based on supply and demand, as well as cost factors. Compared with 2020, the benchmark high-density polyethylene chain margin increased significantly in 2021, due to continued strong demand and tight supply.Our Refining segment results are driven by several factors, including market crack spreads, refinery throughput, feedstock costs, product yields, turnaround activity, and other operating costs. The price of U.S. benchmark crude oil, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) at Cushing, Oklahoma, increased to an average of $67.96 per barrel during 2021, compared with an average of $39.31 per barrel in 2020. Market crack spreads are used as indicators of refining margins and measure the difference between market prices for refined petroleum products and crude oil. Worldwide market crack spreads increased to an average of $17.09 per barrel during 2021, compared with an average of $8.33 per barrel in 2020. The increases in crude oil prices and market crack spreads were primarily driven by a significant increase in demand for refined petroleum products, as economic activities gradually recovered following the administration of COVID-19 vaccines and the easing of pandemic restrictions, as well as tightening supply. In 2021, renewable identification number (RIN) prices increased significantly, compared with 2020.Results for our M&S segment depend largely on marketing fuel and lubricant margins, and sales volumes of our refined petroleum and other specialty products. While marketing fuel and lubricant margins are primarily driven by market factors, largely determined by the relationship between supply and demand, marketing fuel margins, in particular, are influenced by trends in spot prices, and where applicable, retail prices for refined petroleum products in the regions and countries where we operate. In general, a downward trend of spot prices has a favorable impact on marketing fuel margins, while an upward trend of spot prices has an unfavorable impact on marketing fuel margins. The global disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in reduced demand for refined petroleum and specialty products since March 2020. Following the administration of COVID-19 vaccines in 2021 and the easing of pandemic restrictions, demand for refined petroleum and specialty products improved in 2021, compared with 2020.40Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsRESULTS OF OPERATIONSConsolidated ResultsA summary of income (loss) before income taxes by business segment with a reconciliation to net income (loss) attributable to Phillips 66 follows: Millions of DollarsYear Ended December 31 202120202019Midstream$1,610 (9)684 Chemicals1,844 635 879 Refining(2,549)(6,155)1,986 Marketing and Specialties1,809 1,446 1,433 Corporate and Other(974)(881)(804)Income (loss) before income taxes1,740 (4,964)4,178 Income tax expense (benefit)146 (1,250)801 Net income (loss)1,594 (3,714)3,377 Less: net income attributable to noncontrolling interests277 261 301 Net income (loss) attributable to Phillips 66$1,317 (3,975)3,076 2021 vs. 2020 Net income attributable to Phillips 66 for the year ended December 31, 2021, was $1,317 million, compared with a net loss attributable to Phillips 66 of $3,975 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The improvement was primarily due to lower impairments, improved realized refining margins and higher equity earnings from CPChem, partially offset by income tax impacts from improved results.2020 vs. 2019 Net loss attributable to Phillips 66 for the year ended December 31, 2020, was $3,975 million, compared with net income attributable to Phillips 66 of $3,076 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was mainly attributable to:•Lower realized refining margins and decreased refinery production.•A goodwill impairment in our Refining segment.•A long-lived asset impairment associated with our plan to reconfigure the San Francisco Refinery into a renewable fuels production facility, which impacted our Refining and Midstream segments.•Higher impairments of equity investments in our Midstream segment.These decreases were partially offset by an income tax benefit recognized in 2020, compared with income tax expense recognized in 2019. See Note 9—Impairments, and Note 16—Fair Value Measurements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for information on impairments recorded in 2021, 2020 and 2019.See the “Segment Results” section for additional information on our segment results.41Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsStatement of Operations Analysis2021 vs. 2020 Sales and other operating revenues and purchased crude oil and products increased 74% and 77%, respectively, in 2021. These increases were mainly due to higher prices for refined petroleum products, crude oil and NGL, as well as increased volumes for refined petroleum products and crude oil. Equity in earnings of affiliates increased $1,713 million in 2021. The increase was primarily due to higher equity earnings from CPChem mainly driven by increased margins, WRB Refining LP (WRB) resulting from improved realized refining margins and higher refinery production, and Excel Paralubes LLC (Excel) attributable to higher base oil margins. See Chemicals segment analysis in the “Segment Results” section for additional information on CPChem.Net gain on dispositions decreased 83% in 2021, mainly reflecting a before-tax gain of $84 million recognized in the second quarter of 2020 associated with a co-venturer’s acquisition of an ownership interest in the consolidated holding company that owns an interest in Gray Oak Pipeline, LLC. See Note 27—Phillips 66 Partners LP, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information.Other income increased $388 million in 2021, primarily driven by an unrealized gain of $365 million related to the change in fair value of our investment in NOVONIX, which we acquired in the third quarter of 2021.Operating expenses increased 13% in 2021, mainly attributable to higher utility costs driven by increased commodity prices, higher employee-related expenses, and increased maintenance and repair costs.Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 13% in 2021, primarily driven by higher selling expenses due to rising refined petroleum product prices and demand, increased employee-related expenses, and a benefit received from a legal settlement in the first quarter of 2020.Depreciation and amortization increased 15% in 2021, mainly due to asset retirements related to the shutdown of our Alliance Refinery in connection with plans to convert it to a terminal. See Note 7—Properties, Plants and Equipment, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information regarding asset retirements related to our Alliance Refinery. Impairments decreased 65% in 2021. See Note 9—Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information regarding impairments.Taxes other than income taxes decreased 12% in 2021, primarily driven by tax credits received from renewable diesel blending activity at our San Francisco Refinery in 2021, and lower property and franchise taxes.Interest and debt expense increased 16% in 2021, primarily driven by lower capitalized interest due to the completion of capital projects and the placement of assets into service, as well as higher average debt principal balances resulting from new debt issuances in the second and fourth quarters of 2020.We had income tax expense of $146 million in 2021, compared with an income tax benefit of $1,250 million in 2020, primarily due to before-tax income in 2021 versus a before-tax loss in 2020. See Note 21—Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for more information regarding our income taxes.42Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements2020 vs. 2019 Sales and other operating revenues and purchased crude oil and products both decreased 40% in 2020. The decreases were mainly due to lower prices and volumes for refined petroleum products and crude oil, reflecting the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Equity in earnings of affiliates decreased 44% in 2020. The decrease was primarily due to lower realized refining margins and decreased refinery production at WRB, and lower margins, partially offset by higher sales volumes, at CPChem. See Chemicals segment analysis in the “Segment Results” section for additional information on CPChem.Net gain on dispositions increased $88 million in 2020. The increase was mainly due to a gain of $84 million associated with a co-venturer’s prior-year acquisition of a 35% interest in Phillips 66 Partners’ consolidated holding company that owns an interest in Gray Oak Pipeline, LLC. See Note 27—Phillips 66 Partners LP, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information.Operating expenses decreased 10% in 2020, primarily driven by our company-wide cost reduction initiatives in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, lower utility costs, and decreased refinery turnaround activities.Impairments increased $3,391 million in 2020. See Note 9—Impairments, and Note 16—Fair Value Measurements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information associated with impairments.We had an income tax benefit of $1,250 million in 2020, compared with income tax expense of $801 million in 2019, primarily due to a before-tax loss in 2020 versus before-tax income in 2019.

This segment includes our MLP, Phillips 66 Partners, our 50% equity investment in DCP Midstream, which includes the operations of its MLP, DCP Partners, and our 16% investment in NOVONIX.2021 vs. 2020 Results from our Midstream segment increased $1,619 million in 2021, compared with 2020. Results from our Transportation business increased $170 million in 2021, compared with 2020. The increase was primarily due to improved earnings from our equity affiliates, lower asset impairments, and increased pipeline volumes and tariffs. These increases were partially offset by a before-tax gain of $84 million recognized in the second quarter of 2020 associated with a co-venturer’s acquisition of an ownership interest in the consolidated holding company that owns an interest in Gray Oak Pipeline, LLC, and increased depreciation and amortization expense from asset retirements related to the shutdown of the Alliance Refinery in the fourth quarter of 2021. Results from our NGL and Other business increased $306 million in 2021, compared with 2020. The increase in 2021 was primarily driven by a $370 million increase in the value of our investment in NOVONIX, which we acquired in the third quarter of 2021, partially offset by higher utility costs due to increased natural gas prices.44Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsResults from our investment in DCP Midstream increased $1,143 million in 2021, compared with 2020. The increase in 2021 reflects a $1,161 million before-tax impairment of our investment in DCP Midstream recorded in the first quarter of 2020. See Note 9—Impairments, and Note 27—Phillips 66 Partners LP, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information regarding the impairments and the $84 million before-tax gain, respectively.See the “Executive Overview and Business Environment” section for information on market factors impacting 2021 results.2020 vs. 2019 Midstream’s results decreased $693 million in 2020, compared with 2019. Results from our Transportation business decreased $438 million in 2020, compared with 2019. The decrease was primarily attributable to before-tax impairments of $300 million, decreased equity earnings, lower pipeline and terminal throughput volumes, and higher operating costs, partially offset by an $84 million before-tax gain recognized in the second quarter of 2020 associated with the Gray Oak Pipeline joint venture.The $300 million before-tax impairments consisted of a $120 million impairment of the pipeline and terminal assets associated with the planned reconfiguration of our San Francisco Refinery into a renewable fuels production facility, a $96 million impairment of Phillips 66 Partners’ equity investments in two crude oil logistics joint ventures, and an $84 million impairment of our equity investment in the canceled Red Oak Pipeline project. See Note 9—Impairments, and Note 27—Phillips 66 Partners LP, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information regarding the impairments and the $84 million before-tax gain, respectively.Results from our NGL and Other business decreased $81 million in 2020, compared with 2019. The decrease was mainly due to lower results from our trading activities and decreased margins, partially offset by higher export cargos and increased fractionation volumes from the startup of Frac 2 and Frac 3 in late 2020, as well as the startup of a new isomerization unit at our Lake Charles Refinery in the second half of 2019.Results from our investment in DCP Midstream decreased $174 million in 2020, compared with 2019. The decrease was primarily due to higher impairment charges, partially offset by the recognition of a larger benefit to our equity earnings from the amortization of the basis difference associated with the impairments and DCP Midstream’s cost reduction initiatives in response to the challenging business environment.

CPChem uses NGL and other feedstocks to produce petrochemicals. These products are then marketed and sold or used as feedstocks to produce plastics and other chemicals. We structure our reporting of CPChem’s operations around two primary business lines: Olefins and Polyolefins (O&P) and Specialties, Aromatics and Styrenics (SA&S). The O&P business line produces and markets ethylene and other olefin products. Ethylene produced is primarily consumed within CPChem for the production of polyethylene, normal alpha olefins and polyethylene pipe. The SA&S business line manufactures and markets aromatics and styrenics products, such as benzene, cyclohexane, styrene and polystyrene. SA&S also manufactures and/or markets a variety of specialty chemical products. Unless otherwise noted, amounts referenced below reflect our net 50% interest in CPChem.2021 vs. 2020 Before-tax income from the Chemicals segment increased $1,209 million in 2021, compared with 2020. The increase was primarily due to improved margins driven by increased sale prices reflecting strong demand and tight supply, partially offset by higher utility, turnaround, maintenance and repair costs. See the “Executive Overview and Business Environment” section for information on market factors impacting CPChem’s 2021 results.2020 vs. 2019 Before-tax income from the Chemicals segment decreased $244 million in 2020, compared with 2019. The decrease was mainly due to lower margins and decreased earnings from CPChem’s equity affiliates, partially offset by higher sales volumes and a favorable impact from lower-of-cost-or-market adjustments of inventories valued on the last-in-first-out (LIFO) basis attributable to petrochemical product price recovery in 2020. 46Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsRefining Year Ended December 31 202120202019Millions of DollarsIncome (Loss) Before Income TaxesAtlantic Basin/Europe$(36)(1,224)608 Gulf Coast(1,889)(2,077)364 Central Corridor70 (641)1,338 West Coast(694)(2,213)(324)Worldwide$(2,549)(6,155)1,986 Dollars Per BarrelIncome (Loss) Before Income TaxesAtlantic Basin/Europe$(0.19)(7.18)3.11 Gulf Coast(7.84)(9.71)1.24 Central Corridor0.73 (6.96)12.95 West Coast(6.14)(20.01)(2.49)Worldwide(3.99)(10.48)2.75 Realized Refining Margins*Atlantic Basin/Europe$7.48 2.17 9.33 Gulf Coast4.92 1.85 7.42 Central Corridor9.65 7.17 14.91 West Coast7.49 3.43 9.18 Worldwide7.15 3.51 9.91 * See the “Non-GAAP Reconciliations” section for a reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure to the most directly comparable measure under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), income (loss) before income taxes per barrel.47Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsThousands of Barrels Daily Year Ended December 31 202120202019Operating StatisticsRefining operations*Atlantic Basin/EuropeCrude oil capacity537 537 537 Crude oil processed479 434 497 Capacity utilization (percent)89 %81 92 Refinery production522 470 541 Gulf Coast**Crude oil capacity720 769 764 Crude oil processed592 533 725 Capacity utilization (percent)82 %69 95 Refinery production662 586 804 Central CorridorCrude oil capacity531 530 515 Crude oil processed461 431 498 Capacity utilization (percent)87 %81 97 Refinery production476 446 518 West CoastCrude oil capacity364 364 364 Crude oil processed284 279 323 Capacity utilization (percent)78 %77 89 Refinery production308 301 354 WorldwideCrude oil capacity2,152 2,200 2,180 Crude oil processed1,816 1,677 2,043 Capacity utilization (percent)84 %76 94 Refinery production1,968 1,803 2,217 * Includes our share of equity affiliates.** Excludes operating statistics of the Alliance Refinery beginning on October 1, 2021.The Refining segment refines crude oil and other feedstocks into petroleum products, such as gasoline, distillates and aviation fuels, as well as renewable fuels, at 12 refineries in the United States and Europe. Our Alliance Refinery sustained significant impacts from Hurricane Ida in August 2021, and in the fourth quarter of 2021, we announced the shutdown of the refinery in connection with plans to convert it to a terminal. 2021 vs. 2020 Results from the Refining segment increased $3,606 million in 2021, compared with 2020. The improved results in 2021 were primarily due to higher realized refining margins and lower asset impairments, partially offset by increased utility expenses and higher costs related to the shutdown of our Alliance Refinery. The improved realized refining margins in 2021 were mainly attributable to increased market crack spreads, partially offset by higher RIN costs, lower clean product differentials and decreased secondary products margins.Our worldwide refining crude oil capacity utilization rate was 84% and 76% in 2021 and 2020, respectively. The increase in 2021 was primarily driven by improved market demand for refined petroleum products following the administration of COVID-19 vaccines and the easing of pandemic restrictions.

The decreased results in 2020 were due to:•Lower realized refining margins and decreased refinery production. A sharp decline in demand for refined petroleum products resulting from global economic disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic led to lower market crack spreads and reduced refinery production in 2020. In addition, hurricane impacts contributed to the lower refinery production in the Gulf Coast region in 2020.•A before-tax long-lived asset impairment of $910 million in the third quarter of 2020 associated with our plan to reconfigure the San Francisco Refinery into a renewable fuels production facility.•A before-tax goodwill impairment of $1,845 million in the first quarter of 2020.Our worldwide refining crude oil capacity utilization rate was 76% and 94% in 2020 and 2019, respectively. The lower utilization rate in 2020 was primarily due to reduced refining runs driven by lower demand for refined petroleum products as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as hurricane impacts in the Gulf Coast region.

The increase was primarily due to improved realized refining margins, a U.S. federal income tax refund of $1.1 billion received in the second quarter of 2021, and higher cash distributions from our equity affiliates, partially offset by higher operating expenses.During 2020, cash generated by operating activities was $2.1 billion, a 56% decrease compared with 2019. The decrease was primarily due to lower realized refining margins, driven by the global economic disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by lower cash income taxes paid. Our short- and long-term operating cash flows are highly dependent upon refining and marketing margins, NGL prices and chemicals margins. Prices and margins in our industry are typically volatile, and are driven by market conditions over which we have little or no control. Absent other mitigating factors, as these prices and margins fluctuate, we would expect a corresponding change in our operating cash flows. The level and quality of output from our refineries also impact our cash flows. Factors such as operating efficiency, maintenance turnarounds, market conditions, feedstock availability, and weather conditions can affect output. We actively manage the operations of our refineries, and any variability in their operations typically has not been as significant to cash flows as that caused by margins and prices. Our worldwide refining crude oil capacity utilization was 84%, 76% and 94% in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our worldwide refining clean product yield was 83%, 84% and 84% in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.Equity Affiliate Operating DistributionsOur operating cash flows are also impacted by distribution decisions made by our equity affiliates, including CPChem. Over the three years ended December 31, 2021, our operating cash flows included aggregate distributions from our equity affiliates of $6,285 million, including $3,101 million from CPChem. We cannot control the amount or timing of future distributions from equity affiliates; therefore, future distributions are not assured.52Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsTax RefundsWe received a U.S. federal income tax refund of $1.1 billion in the second quarter of 2021. Revolving Credit Facilities and Commercial PaperPhillips 66 has a $5 billion revolving credit facility which may be used for direct bank borrowings, as support for issuances of letters of credit, and as support for our commercial paper program. We have an option to increase the overall capacity to $6 billion, subject to certain conditions. We also have the option to extend the scheduled maturity of the facility for up to two additional one-year terms after its July 30, 2024, maturity date, subject to, among other things, the consent of the lenders holding the majority of the commitments and of each lender extending its commitment. The facility is with a broad syndicate of financial institutions and contains covenants that are usual and customary for an agreement of this type, including a maximum consolidated net debt-to-capitalization ratio of 65% as of the last day of each fiscal quarter. The facility has customary events of default, such as nonpayment of principal when due; nonpayment of interest, fees or other amounts; and violation of covenants. Outstanding borrowings under the facility bear interest, at our option, at either: (a) the Eurodollar rate in effect from time to time plus the applicable margin; or (b) the reference rate (as described in the facility) plus the applicable margin. The facility also provides for customary fees, including commitment fees. The pricing levels for the commitment fees and interest-rate margins are determined based on the ratings in effect for Phillips 66’s senior unsecured long-term debt from time to time. Phillips 66 may at any time prepay outstanding borrowings under the facility, in whole or in part, without premium or penalty. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, no amount had been drawn under the facility. Phillips 66 also has a $5 billion uncommitted commercial paper program for short-term working capital needs that is supported by our revolving credit facility. Commercial paper maturities are contractually limited to 365 days. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, no borrowings were outstanding under the program. Phillips 66 Partners has a $750 million revolving credit facility which may be used for direct bank borrowings and as support for issuances of letters of credit. Phillips 66 Partners has an option to increase the overall capacity to $1 billion, subject to certain conditions. Phillips 66 Partners also has the option to extend the facility for two additional one-year terms after its July 30, 2024, maturity date, subject to, among other things, the consent of the lenders holding the majority of the commitments and of each lender extending its commitment. The facility is with a broad syndicate of financial institutions and contains covenants that are usual and customary for an agreement of this type. The facility has customary events of default, such as nonpayment of principal when due; nonpayment of interest, fees or other amounts; and violation of covenants. Outstanding revolving borrowings under the facility bear interest, at Phillips 66 Partners’ option, at either: (a) the Eurodollar rate in effect from time to time plus the applicable margin; or (b) the reference rate (as described in the facility) plus the applicable margin. The facility also provides for customary fees, including commitment fees. The pricing levels for the commitment fees and interest-rate margins are determined based on Phillips 66 Partners’ credit ratings in effect from time to time. Borrowings under this facility may be short-term or long-term in duration, and Phillips 66 Partners may at any time prepay outstanding borrowings under the facility, in whole or in part, without premium or penalty. At December 31, 2021, no borrowings were outstanding under this facility, compared with borrowings of $415 million at December 31, 2020. At both December 31, 2021 and 2020, $1 million in letters of credit had been issued that were supported by this facility. We had approximately $5.7 billion and $5.3 billion of total committed capacity available under our revolving credit facilities at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. 53Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsOther Debt Issuances and FinancingsSenior Unsecured NotesIn November 2021, Phillips 66 closed its public offering of $1 billion aggregate principal amount of 3.300% senior unsecured notes due 2052. Interest on the Senior Notes due 2052 is payable semiannually on March 15 and September 15 of each year, commencing on March 15, 2022. Proceeds received from the public offering were $982 million, net of underwriters’ discounts and commissions, as well as debt issuance costs. In December 2021, Phillips 66 used the proceeds from this offering, together with cash on hand, to repay $1 billion in aggregate principal amount of its $2 billion 4.300% Senior Notes due April 2022.In November 2020, Phillips 66 closed its public offering of $1.75 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes consisting of:•$450 million aggregate principal amount of Floating Rate Senior Notes due 2024.•$800 million aggregate principal amount of 0.900% Senior Notes due 2024.•$500 million aggregate principal amount of 1.300% Senior Notes due 2026.The Floating Rate Senior Notes bear interest at a floating rate, reset quarterly, equal to the three-month London Interbank Offered Rate plus 0.62% per year, subject to adjustment. In December 2021, we used cash on hand to repay the $450 million Floating Rate Senior Notes due 2024. Interest on the Senior Notes due 2024 and 2026 is payable semiannually on February 15 and August 15 of each year, commencing on February 15, 2021. Proceeds received from the public offering of senior unsecured notes in November 2020 were $1.74 billion, net of underwriters’ discounts and commissions, as well as debt issuance costs. In June 2020, Phillips 66 closed its public offering of $1 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes consisting of:•$150 million aggregate principal amount of 3.850% Senior Notes due 2025.•$850 million aggregate principal amount of 2.150% Senior Notes due 2030.In April 2020, Phillips 66 closed its public offering of $1 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes consisting of:•$500 million aggregate principal amount of 3.700% Senior Notes due 2023.•$500 million aggregate principal amount of 3.850% Senior Notes due 2025. Interest on the Senior Notes due 2023 is payable semiannually on April 6 and October 6 of each year, commencing on October 6, 2020. The Senior Notes due 2025 issued in June 2020 constitute a further issuance of the Senior Notes due 2025 originally issued in April 2020. The $650 million in aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes due 2025 is treated as a single class of debt securities. Interest on the Senior Notes due 2025 is payable semiannually on April 9 and October 9 of each year, commencing on October 9, 2020. Interest on the Senior Notes due 2030 is payable semiannually on June 15 and December 15 of each year, commencing on December 15, 2020. Proceeds received from the public offerings of senior unsecured notes in June and April of 2020 were $1,008 million exclusive of accrued interest received, and $993 million, respectively, net of underwriters’ discounts or premiums and commissions, as well as debt issuance costs. Term Loan FacilityIn March 2020, we entered into a $1 billion 364-day delayed draw term loan agreement (the Facility) and borrowed $1 billion under the Facility shortly thereafter. In November 2020, we repaid $500 million of borrowings outstanding under the Facility, and the Facility was amended to extend the maturity date of the remaining $500 million to November 20, 2023. In September 2021, we repaid the outstanding borrowings of $500 million.54Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsAvailability of Debt FinancingWe have an A3 credit rating, with a stable outlook, from Moody’s Investors Service and a BBB+ credit rating, with a stable outlook, from Standard & Poor’s. In the fourth quarter of 2021, both rating agencies updated their outlooks on our credit ratings from negative to stable. These investment grade ratings have served to lower our borrowing costs and facilitate access to a variety of lenders. We do not have any ratings triggers on any of our corporate debt that would cause an automatic default, and thereby impact our access to liquidity, in the event of a rating downgrade by one or both rating agencies. Failure to maintain investment grade ratings could prohibit us from accessing the commercial paper market, although we would expect to be able to access funds under our liquidity facilities mentioned above.Phillips 66 Partners’ Debt and Equity FinancingsIn 2013, we formed Phillips 66 Partners, a publicly traded MLP, which owns and operates primarily fee-based midstream assets. At December 31, 2021, we owned 170 million Phillips 66 Partners common units, representing a 74% limited partner interest, while the public owned a 26% limited partner interest and 13.5 million perpetual convertible preferred units. We consolidate Phillips 66 Partners as a variable interest entity for financial reporting purposes. As a result of this consolidation, the public common and preferred unitholders’ interests in Phillips 66 Partners are reflected as noncontrolling interests of $2,169 million in our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2021. During the three years ended December 31, 2021, Phillips 66 Partners raised proceeds, primarily used for its capital spending and investments, from the following third-party debt and equity offerings: •In April 2021, Phillips 66 Partners entered into a $450 million term loan agreement and borrowed the full amount. Proceeds from this term loan were primarily used to repay the outstanding borrowings under its $750 million revolving credit facility.•In September 2019, Phillips 66 Partners received net proceeds of $892 million from the issuance of $300 million of 2.450% Senior Notes due December 2024 and $600 million of 3.150% Senior Notes due December 2029.•In March 2019, Phillips 66 Partners entered into a senior unsecured term loan facility with a borrowing capacity of $400 million due March 20, 2020. Phillips 66 Partners borrowed an aggregate amount of $400 million under the facility during the first half of 2019, which was repaid in full in September 2019. •Phillips 66 Partners has authorized an aggregate of $750 million under three $250 million continuous offerings of common units, or at-the-market (ATM) programs. Phillips 66 Partners completed the first two programs in June 2018 and December 2019, respectively. For the three years ended December 31, 2021, net proceeds of $175 million have been received under these programs.See Note 27—Phillips 66 Partners LP, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information regarding Phillips 66 Partners.55Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsOff-Balance Sheet ArrangementsLease Residual Value GuaranteesUnder the operating lease agreement for our headquarters facility in Houston, Texas, we have the option, at the end of the lease term in September 2025, to request to renew the lease, purchase the facility or assist the lessor in marketing it for resale. We have a residual value guarantee associated with the operating lease agreement with a maximum potential future exposure of $514 million at December 31, 2021. We also have residual value guarantees associated with railcar and airplane leases with maximum potential future exposures totaling $221 million. These leases have remaining terms of up to ten years.Dakota Access, LLC (Dakota Access) and Energy Transfer Crude Oil Company, LLC (ETCO)In 2020, the trial court presiding over litigation regarding the Dakota Access Pipeline ordered the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) relating to an easement under Lake Oahe in North Dakota and later vacated the easement. Although the easement has been vacated, the USACE has indicated that it will not take action to stop pipeline operations while it proceeds with the EIS, which is expected to be completed in the second half of 2022. In May 2021, the court denied a request for an injunction to shut down the pipeline while the EIS is being prepared and, in June 2021, dismissed the litigation. It is possible that the litigation could be reopened or new litigation challenging the EIS, once completed, could be filed. In September 2021, Dakota Access filed a writ of certiorari, requesting the U.S. Supreme Court to review the lower court’s judgment that ordered the EIS and vacated the easement. In March 2019, a wholly owned subsidiary of Dakota Access closed an offering of $2.5 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes consisting of:•$650 million aggregate principal amount of 3.625% Senior Notes due 2022. •$1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 3.900% Senior Notes due 2024. •$850 million aggregate principal amount of 4.625% Senior Notes due 2029. Dakota Access and ETCO have guaranteed repayment of the notes. In addition, Phillips 66 Partners and its co-venturers in Dakota Access provided a Contingent Equity Contribution Undertaking (CECU) in conjunction with the notes offering. Under the CECU, the co-venturers may be severally required to make proportionate equity contributions to Dakota Access if there is an unfavorable final judgment in the above mentioned ongoing litigation. Contributions may be required if Dakota Access determines that the issues included in any such final judgment cannot be remediated and Dakota Access has or is projected to have insufficient funds to satisfy repayment of the notes. If Dakota Access undertakes remediation to cure issues raised in a final judgment, contributions may be required if any series of the notes become due, whether by acceleration or at maturity, during such time, to the extent Dakota Access has or is projected to have insufficient funds to pay such amounts. At December 31, 2021, Phillips 66 Partners’ share of the maximum potential equity contributions under the CECU was approximately $631 million.If the pipeline is required to cease operations, and should Dakota Access and ETCO not have sufficient funds to pay ongoing expenses, Phillips 66 Partners also could be required to support its share of the ongoing expenses, including scheduled interest payments on the notes of approximately $25 million annually, in addition to the potential obligations under the CECU.See Note 13—Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information on our guarantees.56Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsCapital RequirementsCapital Expenditures and InvestmentsFor information about our capital expenditures and investments, see the “Capital Spending” section below. Debt FinancingOur debt balance at December 31, 2021, was $14.4 billion and our total debt-to-capital ratio was 40%. In 2021, we paid down $1.5 billion in debt and will continue to prioritize debt reduction in 2022. As our operating cash flows improve further, we expect to reduce our debt to pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels over the next couple of years. See Note 12—Debt, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for our annual debt maturities over the next five years and more information on debt repayments.Joint Venture LoansDuring 2020 and 2021, we and our co-venturer provided member loans to WRB. At December 31, 2021, our share of the outstanding member loan balance, including accrued interest, was $595 million. The need for additional loans to WRB in 2022, as well as WRB’s repayment schedule, will depend on market conditions.DividendsOn February 9, 2022, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.92 per common share, payable March 1, 2022, to holders of record at the close of business on February 22, 2022. We expect that our Board of Directors will continue to declare a competitive and growing dividend in 2022. Share RepurchasesSince July 2012, our board of directors has authorized an aggregate of $15 billion of repurchases of our outstanding common stock. The authorizations do not have expiration dates. The share repurchases are expected to be funded primarily through available cash. We are not obligated to repurchase any shares of common stock pursuant to these authorizations and may commence, suspend or terminate repurchases at any time. Since the inception of our share repurchase program in 2012, we have repurchased 159 million shares at an aggregate cost of $12.5 billion. Shares of stock repurchased are held as treasury shares. We suspended our share repurchase program in March 2020 to preserve liquidity. As operating cash flows improve further, we will prioritize shareholder returns and debt repayment. Pending Merger with Phillips 66 PartnersOn October 26, 2021, we entered into a definitive merger agreement with Phillips 66 Partners to acquire all of the limited partner interests in Phillips 66 Partners not already owned by us on the closing date of the transaction. The agreement provides for an all-stock transaction in which each outstanding Phillips 66 Partners common unitholder would receive 0.50 shares of Phillips 66 common stock for each Phillips 66 Partners common unit. Phillips 66 Partners’ perpetual convertible preferred units would be converted into common units at a premium to the original issuance price prior to exchange for Phillips 66 common stock. This merger is expected to close in March 2022, subject to customary closing conditions. Based on the closing market prices of Phillips 66 common stock and Phillips 66 Partners common units on December 31, 2021, we would issue approximately 44 million shares of our common stock with a value of approximately $3.2 billion on the closing date of this transaction. The number of shares of common stock we will issue and the value of those shares are subject to change until the merger is closed.See Note 27—Phillips 66 Partners LP, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information on the pending merger. 57Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsContractual ObligationsOur contractual obligations primarily consist of purchase obligations, outstanding debt principal and interest obligations, operating and finance lease obligations, and asset retirement and environmental obligations.Purchase ObligationsOur purchase obligations represent agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable, legally binding and specify all significant terms. We expect these purchase obligations will be fulfilled with operating cash flows in the period when due. As of December 31, 2021, our purchase obligations totaled $113.9 billion, with $43.0 billion due within one year. The majority of our purchase obligations are market-based contracts, including exchanges and futures, for the purchase of products such as crude oil and raw NGL. The products are used to supply our refineries and fractionators and optimize our supply chain. At December 31, 2021, product purchase commitments with third parties and related parties were $44.8 billion and $51.3 billion, respectively. The remaining purchase obligations mainly represent agreements to access and utilize the capacity of third-party equipment and facilities, including pipelines and product terminals, to transport, process, treat, and store products, and our net share of purchase commitments for materials and services for jointly owned facilities where we are the operator.Debt Principal and Interest ObligationsAs of December 31, 2021, our aggregate principal amount of outstanding debt was $14.3 billion, with $1.5 billion due within one year. Our obligations for interest on the debt totaled $7.5 billion, with $513 million due within one year. See Note 12—Debt, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information regarding our outstanding debt principal and interest obligations. Finance and Operating Lease ObligationsSee Note 18—Leases, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for information regarding our lease obligations and timing of our expected lease payments.Asset Retirement and Environmental ObligationsSee Note 10—Asset Retirement Obligations and Accrued Environmental Costs, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for information regarding asset retirement and environmental obligations.58Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsCapital Spending Our capital expenditures and investments represent consolidated capital spending.

We completed two NGL fractionators (Sweeny Fracs 2 and 3) which commenced operations in 2020. In 2021, we resumed the construction of Sweeny Frac 4.•Contributions by Phillips 66 Partners to fund the Gray Oak Pipeline project and South Texas Gateway Terminal development activities.•Completion of construction activities on Phillips 66 Partners’ C2G Pipeline, a new 16 inch ethane pipeline that connects Phillips 66 Partners’ Clemens Caverns storage facility to petrochemical facilities in Gregory, Texas, near Corpus Christi. •Investments in NOVONIX and a renewable feedstock processing plant.•Construction of Phillips 66 Partners’ Sweeny to Pasadena refined petroleum product pipeline. •Construction activities to increase storage and export capacity at our Beaumont Terminal.•Contributions to Dakota Access by Phillips 66 Partners for a pipeline optimization project. •Construction of Phillips 66 Partners’ new isomerization unit at the Lake Charles Refinery.59Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements•Contributions to Bayou Bridge Pipeline, LLC, a Phillips 66 Partners’ 40 percent-owned joint venture, for the construction of a pipeline from Nederland, Texas, to Lake Charles, Louisiana, and a pipeline segment from Lake Charles to St. James, Louisiana. •Spending associated with other return, reliability, and maintenance projects in our Transportation and NGL businesses. During the three-year period ended December 31, 2021, DCP Midstream’s self-funded capital expenditures and investments were $1.3 billion on a 100% basis. Capital spending during this period was primarily for expansion projects and maintenance capital expenditures for existing assets. Expansion projects included construction of the Latham II offload facilities, the Cheyenne Connector, and the O’Connor 2 plant, as well as investments in the Sand Hills, Southern Hills and Gulf Coast Express pipeline joint ventures.ChemicalsDuring the three-year period ended December 31, 2021, CPChem had a self-funded capital program that totaled $2.1 billion on a 100% basis. Capital spending was primarily for the development of petrochemical projects on the U.S. Gulf Coast and in the Middle East, as well as sustaining, debottlenecking and optimization projects on existing assets.RefiningCapital spending for the Refining segment during the three-year period ended December 31, 2021, was $2.6 billion, primarily for refinery upgrade projects to enhance the yield of high-value products, renewable diesel projects, improvements to the operating integrity of key processing units, and safety-related projects. Key projects completed during the three-year period included: •Installation of facilities to improve product value at our Ponca City Refinery and facilities to provide flexibility to produce renewable diesel at our San Francisco Refinery.•Installation of facilities to improve clean product yield at the Ponca City and Lake Charles refineries, as well as the jointly owned Borger Refinery.•Installation of facilities to improve product value at the Sweeny, Humber and Los Angeles refineries.•Installation of facilities to improve processing of advantaged crude at the Humber refinery.•Installation of facilities to comply with the EPA Tier 3 gasoline regulations at the Ferndale Refinery.Marketing and SpecialtiesCapital spending for the M&S segment during the three-year period ended December 31, 2021, was primarily for investment in retail marketing joint ventures in the U.S. West Coast and Central regions; the continued acquisition, development and enhancement of retail sites in Europe; and acquisition of a commercial fleet fueling business in California, which will provide further placement opportunities for renewable diesel production to end-use customers.Corporate and OtherCapital spending for Corporate and Other during the three-year period ended December 31, 2021, was primarily for information technology and facilities.60Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements2022 BudgetOur 2022 capital budget is $1.9 billion, including $992 million for sustaining capital and $916 million for growth capital. Approximately 45% of growth capital supports lower-carbon opportunities. Our projected $1.9 billion capital budget excludes our portion of planned capital spending by our major joint ventures CPChem, WRB and DCP Midstream totaling $1.1 billion.The Midstream capital budget of $703 million includes a growth capital budget of $426 million which will be directed toward completing construction of Sweeny Frac 4, repayment of Phillips 66 Partners’ 25% share of Dakota Access’ debt due in 2022, and investment opportunities to advance our lower-carbon efforts. The Midstream capital budget also includes $277 million for sustaining projects. In Refining, the total capital budget of $896 million consists of $488 million for reliability, safety and environmental projects and $408 million of growth capital primarily for the reconfiguration of our San Francisco Refinery as part of the Rodeo Renewed project. The M&S capital budget of $144 million reflects the continued development and enhancement of our retail network, including energy transition opportunities. The Corporate and Other capital budget is $165 million primarily for digital transformation projects.ContingenciesA number of lawsuits involving a variety of claims that arose in the ordinary course of business have been filed against us or are subject to indemnifications provided by us. We also may be required to remove or mitigate the effects on the environment of the placement, storage, disposal or release of certain chemical, mineral and petroleum substances at various active and inactive sites. We regularly assess the need for financial recognition or disclosure of these contingencies. In the case of all known contingencies (other than those related to income taxes), we accrue a liability when the loss is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable. If a range of amounts can be reasonably estimated and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount, then the minimum of the range is accrued. We do not reduce these liabilities for potential insurance or third-party recoveries. If applicable, we accrue receivables for probable insurance or other third-party recoveries. In the case of income tax-related contingencies, we use a cumulative probability-weighted loss accrual in cases where sustaining a tax position is uncertain.Based on currently available information, we believe it is remote that future costs related to known contingent liability exposures will exceed current accruals by an amount that would have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements. As we learn new facts concerning contingencies, we reassess our position both with respect to accrued liabilities and other potential exposures. Estimates particularly sensitive to future changes include contingent liabilities recorded for environmental remediation, tax and legal matters. Estimated future environmental remediation costs are subject to change due to such factors as the uncertain magnitude of cleanup costs, the unknown time and extent of such remedial actions that may be required, and the determination of our liability in proportion to that of other potentially responsible parties. Estimated future costs related to tax and legal matters are subject to change as events evolve and as additional information becomes available during the administrative and litigation processes.Legal and Tax MattersOur legal and tax matters are handled by our legal and tax organizations. These organizations apply their knowledge, experience and professional judgment to the specific characteristics of our cases and uncertain tax positions. We employ a litigation management process to manage and monitor the legal proceedings. Our process facilitates the early evaluation and quantification of potential exposures in individual cases and enables the tracking of those cases that have been scheduled for trial and/or mediation. Based on professional judgment and experience in using these litigation management tools and available information about current developments in all our cases, our legal organization regularly assesses the adequacy of current accruals and determines if adjustment of existing accruals, or establishment of new accruals, is required. In the case of income tax-related contingencies, we monitor tax legislation and court decisions, the status of tax audits and the statute of limitations within which a taxing authority can assert a liability. See Note 21—Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information about income tax-related contingencies.61Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsEnvironmentalWe are subject to numerous international, federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. Among the most significant of these international and federal environmental laws and regulations are the:•U.S. Federal Clean Air Act, which governs air emissions.•U.S. Federal Clean Water Act, which governs discharges into water bodies.•European Union Regulation for Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH), which governs production, marketing and use of chemicals.•U.S. Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), which imposes liability on generators, transporters and arrangers of hazardous substances at sites where hazardous substance releases have occurred or are threatening to occur.•U.S. Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), which governs the treatment, storage and disposal of solid waste.•U.S. Federal Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA), which requires facilities to report toxic chemical inventories to local emergency planning committees and response departments.•U.S. Federal Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA90), under which owners and operators of onshore facilities and pipelines as well as owners and operators of vessels are liable for removal costs and damages that result from a discharge of crude oil into navigable waters of the United States.•European Union Trading Directive resulting in the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS), which uses a market-based mechanism to incentivize the reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, as well as the United Kingdom Emissions Trading Scheme (UK ETS), which replaced the EU ETS in the United Kingdom on January 1, 2021, but the United Kingdom had the obligation and retained the ability to enforce the EU ETS obligations until April 30, 2021.These laws and their implementing regulations set limits on emissions and, in the case of discharges to water, establish water quality limits. They also, in most cases, require permits in association with new or modified operations. These permits can require an applicant to collect substantial information in connection with the application process, which can be expensive and time consuming. In addition, there can be delays associated with notice and comment periods and the agency’s processing of the application. Many of the delays associated with the permitting process are beyond the control of the applicant.Other foreign countries and many states where we operate also have, or are developing, similar environmental laws and regulations governing these same types of activities. While similar, in some cases these regulations may impose additional, or more stringent, requirements that can add to the cost and difficulty of developing infrastructure and marketing and transporting products across state and international borders. For example, in California the South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD) approved amendments to the Regional Clean Air Incentives Market (RECLAIM) that became effective in 2016, which require a phased reduction of nitrogen oxide emissions through 2022, affecting refineries in the Los Angeles metropolitan area. In 2017, SCAQMD required additional nitrogen dioxide emissions reductions through 2025 and, on November 5, 2021, promulgated new regulations to replace the RECLAIM program with a traditional command and control regulatory regime.The ultimate financial impact arising from environmental laws and regulations is neither clearly known nor easily determinable as new standards, such as air emission standards, water quality standards and stricter fuel regulations, continue to evolve. However, environmental laws and regulations, including those that may arise to address concerns about global climate change, are expected to continue to have an increasing impact on our operations in the United States and in other countries in which we operate. Notable areas of potential impacts include air emissions compliance and remediation obligations in the United States.62Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsAn example of this in the fuels area is the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA). It requires fuel producers and importers to provide additional renewable fuels for transportation motor fuels and stipulates a mix of various types. RINs form the mechanism used by the EPA to record compliance with the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS). If an obligated party has more RINs than it needs to meet its obligation, it may sell or trade the extra RINs, or instead choose to “bank” them for use the following year. We have met the requirements to date while establishing implementation, operating and capital strategies, along with advanced technology development, to address projected future renewable volume obligation (RVO) requirements. On December 7, 2021, the EPA proposed RVO for the 2021 and 2022 compliance years, which essentially holds the 2021 RVO to actual volumes of biofuel consumption, while increasing the volumes in 2022. The EPA also re-proposed the compliance year 2020 RVO, also holding them to actual volumes. It is uncertain how various future RVO requirements contained in EISA, and the regulations promulgated thereunder, may be implemented and what their full impact may be on our operations. Additionally, we may experience a decrease in demand for refined petroleum products due to the regulatory program as currently promulgated. This program continues to be the subject of possible Congressional review and re-promulgation in revised form, and the EPA’s final regulations establishing RVO requirements have been and continue to be subject to legal challenge, further creating uncertainty regarding RVO requirements. Compliance with the regulation has been further complicated as the market for RINs has been the subject of fraudulent third-party activity, and it is possible that some RINs that we have purchased may be determined to be invalid. Should that occur, we could incur costs to replace those fraudulent RINs. Although the cost for replacing any fraudulently marketed RINs is not reasonably estimable at this time, we would not expect such costs to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition.We are required to purchase RINs in the open market to satisfy the portion of our obligation under the RFS that is not fulfilled by blending renewable fuels into the motor fuels we produce. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, we incurred expenses of $441 million, $342 million and $111 million, respectively, associated with our obligation to purchase RINs in the open market to comply with the RFS for our wholly owned refineries. These expenses are included in the “Purchased crude oil and products” line item on our consolidated statement of operations. Our jointly owned refineries also incurred expenses associated with the purchase of RINs in the open market, of which our share was $351 million, $133 million and $74 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. These expenses are included in the “Equity in earnings of affiliates” line item on our consolidated statement of operations. The amount of these expenses and fluctuations between periods is primarily driven by the market price of RINs, refinery production, blending activities, and RVO requirements.We also are subject to certain laws and regulations relating to environmental remediation obligations associated with current and past operations. Such laws and regulations include CERCLA and RCRA and their state equivalents. Remediation obligations include cleanup responsibility arising from petroleum releases from underground storage tanks located at numerous previously and currently owned and/or operated petroleum-marketing outlets throughout the United States. Federal and state laws require contamination caused by such underground storage tank releases be assessed and remediated to meet applicable standards. In addition to other cleanup standards, many states have adopted cleanup criteria for methyl tertiary-butyl ether (MTBE) for both soil and groundwater and both the EPA and many states may adopt cleanup standards for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), which may have been a constituent in certain firefighting foams used or stored at or near some of our facilities.At RCRA-permitted facilities, we are required to assess environmental conditions. If conditions warrant, we may be required to remediate contamination caused by prior operations. In contrast to CERCLA, which is often referred to as “Superfund,” the cost of corrective action activities under RCRA corrective action programs typically is borne solely by us. We anticipate increased expenditures for RCRA remediation activities may be required, but such annual expenditures for the near term are not expected to vary significantly from the range of such expenditures we have experienced over the past few years. Longer-term expenditures are subject to considerable uncertainty and may fluctuate significantly.We occasionally receive requests for information or notices of potential liability from the EPA and state environmental agencies alleging that we are a potentially responsible party under CERCLA or an equivalent state statute. On occasion, we also have been made a party to cost recovery litigation by those agencies or by private parties. These requests, notices and lawsuits assert potential liability for remediation costs at various sites that typically are not owned by us, but allegedly contain wastes attributable to our past operations. As of December 31, 2020, we reported that we had been notified of potential liability under CERCLA and comparable state laws at 25 sites within the United States. During 2021, there were no new sites for which we received notice of potential liability nor were any existing sites deemed resolved and closed, leaving 25 unresolved sites with potential liability at December 31, 2021.63Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsFor the majority of Superfund sites, our potential liability will be less than the total site remediation costs because the percentage of waste attributable to us, versus that attributable to all other potentially responsible parties, is relatively low. Although liability of those potentially responsible is generally joint and several for federal sites and frequently so for state sites, other potentially responsible parties at sites where we are a party typically have had the financial strength to meet their obligations, and where they have not, or where potentially responsible parties could not be located, our share of liability has not increased materially. Many of the sites for which we are potentially responsible are still under investigation by the EPA or the state agencies concerned. Prior to actual cleanup, those potentially responsible normally assess site conditions, apportion responsibility and determine the appropriate remediation. In some instances, we may have no liability or attain a settlement of liability. Actual cleanup costs generally occur after the parties obtain the EPA or equivalent state agency approval of a remediation plan. There are relatively few sites where we are a major participant, and given the timing and amounts of anticipated expenditures, neither the cost of remediation at those sites nor such costs at all CERCLA sites, in the aggregate, is expected to have a material adverse effect on our competitive or financial condition.We incur costs related to the prevention, control, abatement or elimination of environmental pollution. Expensed environmental costs were $726 million in 2021 and are expected to be approximately $725 million and $775 million in 2022 and 2023, respectively. Capitalized environmental costs were $96 million in 2021 and are expected to be approximately $115 million and $165 million, in 2022 and 2023, respectively. These amounts do not include capital expenditures made for other purposes that have an indirect benefit on environmental compliance. Accrued liabilities for remediation activities are not reduced for potential recoveries from insurers or other third parties and are not discounted (except those assumed in a business combination, which we record on a discounted basis).Many of these liabilities result from CERCLA, RCRA and similar state laws that require us to undertake certain investigative and remedial activities at sites where we conduct, or once conducted, operations or at sites where our generated waste was disposed. We also have accrued for a number of sites we identified that may require environmental remediation, but which are not currently the subject of CERCLA, RCRA or state enforcement activities. If applicable, we accrue receivables for probable insurance or other third-party recoveries. In the future, we may incur significant costs under both CERCLA and RCRA. Remediation activities vary substantially in duration and cost from site to site, depending on the mix of unique site characteristics, evolving remediation technologies, diverse regulatory agencies and enforcement policies, and the presence or absence of potentially liable third parties. Therefore, it is difficult to develop reasonable estimates of future site remediation costs.Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, and as with other companies engaged in similar businesses, environmental costs and liabilities are inherent concerns in certain of our operations and products, and there can be no assurance that those costs and liabilities will not be material. However, we currently do not expect any material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position as a result of compliance with current environmental laws and regulations.Climate ChangeThere has been a broad range of proposed or promulgated state, national and international laws focusing on GHG emissions reduction, including various regulations proposed or issued by the EPA. These proposed or promulgated laws apply or could apply in states and/or countries where we have interests or may have interests in the future. Laws regulating GHG emissions continue to evolve, and while it is not possible to accurately estimate either a timetable for implementation or our future compliance costs relating to implementation, such laws potentially could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition as a result of increasing costs of compliance, lengthening project implementation and agency reviews, or reducing demand for certain hydrocarbon products. Examples of legislation or precursors for possible regulation that do or could affect our operations include: •EU ETS, which is part of the European Union’s policy to combat climate change and is a key tool for reducing industrial GHG emissions. EU ETS impacts factories, power stations and other installations across all EU member states. As a result of the United Kingdom’s exit from the European Union (BREXIT), those types of entities in the United Kingdom became subject to the UK ETS, rather than the EU ETS, after the EU ETS 2020 scheme year ended on April 30, 2021.64Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements•California’s Senate Bill No. 32, which requires reduction of California's GHG emissions to 40% below the 1990 emission level by 2030, and Assembly Bill 398, which extends the California GHG emission cap and trade program through 2030. Other GHG emissions programs in the western U.S. states have been enacted or are under consideration or development, including amendments to California's Low Carbon Fuel Standard, Oregon's Low Carbon Fuel Standard and Climate Protection Plan, and Washington's carbon reduction programs.•The U.S. Supreme Court decision in Massachusetts v. EPA, 549 U.S. 497, 127 S. Ct. 1438 (2007), confirming that the EPA has the authority to regulate carbon dioxide as an “air pollutant” under the Federal Clean Air Act.•The EPA’s announcement on March 29, 2010 (published as “Interpretation of Regulations that Determine Pollutants Covered by Clean Air Act Permitting Programs,” 75 Fed. Reg. 17004 (April 2, 2010)), and the EPA’s and U.S. Department of Transportation’s joint promulgation of a Final Rule on April 1, 2010, that triggers regulation of GHGs under the Clean Air Act. These collectively may lead to more climate-based claims for damages, and may result in longer agency review time for development projects to determine the extent of potential climate change. •The EPA's 2015 Final Rule regulating GHG emissions from existing fossil fuel-fired electrical generating units under the Federal Clean Air Act, commonly referred to as the Clean Power Plan. The EPA commenced rulemaking in 2017 to rescind the Clean Power Plan and, in August 2018, the EPA proposed the Affordable Clean Energy (ACE) rule as its replacement. On January 19, 2021, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia invalidated the ACE rule and remanded the matter to the EPA, essentially restarting this rulemaking process. •Carbon taxes in certain jurisdictions.•GHG emission cap and trade programs in certain jurisdictions.In the EU, the first phase of the EU ETS completed at the end of 2007. Phase II was undertaken from 2008 through 2012, and Phase III ran from 2013 through to 2020. Phase IV runs from January 1, 2021 through 2030 and sectors covered under the ETS must reduce their GHG emissions by 43% compared to 2005 levels. Since January 1, 2021, the United Kingdom is no longer part of the EU ETS and, instead, has been under the UK ETS. However, the United Kingdom had the obligation and retained the ability to enforce the EU ETS obligations until April 30, 2021. Phillips 66 has assets that are subject to the EU ETS and assets that are subject to the UK ETS.From November 30 to December 12, 2015, more than 190 countries, including the United States, participated in the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris, France. The conference culminated in what is known as the “Paris Agreement,” which, upon certain conditions being met, entered into force on November 4, 2016. The Paris Agreement establishes a commitment by signatory parties to pursue domestic GHG emission reductions. In 2017, President Trump announced his intention to withdraw the United States from the Paris Agreement and that withdrawal became effective on November 4, 2020. On January 20, 2021, President Biden signed the “Acceptance on Behalf of the United States of America,” which allows the United States to rejoin the Paris Agreement. The United States officially rejoined the Paris Agreement in February 2021, which could lead to additional GHG emission reduction requirements for sources in the United States.In the United States, some additional form of regulation is likely to be forthcoming at the state or federal levels with respect to GHG emissions. Such regulation could take any of several forms that may result in additional financial burden in the form of taxes, the restriction of output, investments of capital to maintain compliance with laws and regulations, or required acquisition or trading of emission allowances. Compliance with changes in laws and regulations that create a GHG emission trading program, GHG reduction requirements or carbon taxes could significantly increase our costs, reduce demand for fossil energy derived products, impact the cost and availability of capital and increase our exposure to litigation. Such laws and regulations could also increase demand for less carbon intensive energy sources. 65Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsAn example of one such program is California’s cap and trade program, which was promulgated pursuant to the State’s Global Warming Solutions Act. The program had been limited to certain stationary sources, which include our refineries in California, but beginning in January 2015 was expanded to include emissions from transportation fuels distributed in California. Inclusion of transportation fuels in California’s cap and trade program as currently promulgated has increased our cap and trade program compliance costs. The ultimate impact on our financial performance, either positive or negative, from this and similar programs, will depend on a number of factors, including, but not limited to:•Whether and to what extent legislation or regulation is enacted.•The nature of the legislation or regulation, such as a cap and trade system or a tax on emissions.•The GHG reductions required.•The price and availability of offsets.•The demand for, and amount and allocation of allowances.•Technological and scientific developments leading to new products or services.•Any potential significant physical effects of climate change, such as increased severe weather events, changes in sea levels and changes in temperature.•Whether, and the extent to which, increased compliance costs are ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services.We consider and take into account anticipated future GHG emissions in designing and developing major facilities and projects, and implement energy efficiency initiatives to reduce GHG emissions. Data on our GHG emissions, legal requirements regulating such emissions, and the possible physical effects of climate change on our coastal assets are incorporated into our planning, investment, and risk management decision-making. We are working to continuously improve operational and energy efficiency through resource and energy conservation throughout our operations.In September 2021, we announced a set of company-wide GHG emission intensity reduction targets that we consider to be impactful, attainable and measurable. By 2030, we expect to reduce GHG emission intensity by 30% for Scope 1 and 2 emissions from our operations and by 15% for Scope 3 emissions from our energy products, below 2019 levels.In addition to the disclosures above, we have issued our 2021 Sustainability Report that is accessible on our website and provides more detailed information on our Environmental, Social and Corporate Governance (ESG) initiatives, including detailed information on environmental metrics.66Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATESThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to select appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. See Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for descriptions of our major accounting policies. Some of these accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent that there is a reasonable likelihood that materially different amounts would have been reported under different conditions, or if different assumptions had been used. The following discussion of critical accounting estimates, along with the discussion of contingencies in this report, addresses all important accounting areas where the nature of accounting estimates or assumptions could be material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change.Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Equity Method InvestmentsLong-lived assets used in operations are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate a possible significant deterioration in future expected cash flows. If the sum of the undiscounted expected future before-tax cash flows of an asset group is less than the carrying value, including applicable liabilities, the carrying value is written down to estimated fair value. Individual assets are grouped for impairment purposes based on a judgmental assessment of the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets. Because there usually is a lack of quoted market prices for long-lived assets, the fair value of impaired assets is typically determined using one or more of the following methods: the present value of expected future cash flows using discount rates and other assumptions believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants; a market multiple for similar assets; historical market transactions including similar assets, adjusted using principal market participant assumptions when necessary; or replacement cost adjusted for physical deterioration and economic obsolescence. The expected future cash flows used for impairment reviews and related fair value calculations are based on judgmental assessments, including future volumes, commodity prices, operating costs, margins, discount rates and capital project decisions, considering all available information at the date of review.Investments in nonconsolidated entities accounted for under the equity method are assessed for impairment when there are indicators of a loss in value, such as a lack of sustained earnings capacity or a current fair value less than the investment’s carrying amount. When it is determined that an indicated impairment is other than temporary, a charge is recognized for the difference between the investment’s carrying value and its estimated fair value. When determining whether a decline in value is other than temporary, management considers factors such as the duration and extent of the decline, the investee’s financial condition and near-term prospects, and our ability and intention to retain our investment for a period that allows for recovery. When quoted market prices are not available, the fair value is usually based on the present value of expected future cash flows using discount rates and other assumptions believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants and observed market earnings multiples of comparable companies, if appropriate. Different assumptions could affect the timing and the amount of an impairment of an investment in any period.See Note 9—Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for information about significant impairments recorded in 2021, 2020 and 2019.Asset Retirement ObligationsUnder various contracts, permits and regulations, we have legal obligations to remove tangible long-lived assets and restore the land at the end of operations at certain operational sites. Estimating the timing and cost of future asset removals is difficult. Our recognized asset retirement obligations primarily involve asbestos abatement at our refineries; decommissioning, removal or dismantlement of certain assets at refineries that have or will be shut down; and dismantlement or removal of assets at certain leased international marketing sites. Many of these removal obligations are many years, or decades, in the future, and the contracts and regulations often have vague descriptions of what removal practices and criteria must be met when the removal event actually occurs. Asset removal technologies and costs, regulatory and other compliance considerations, expenditure timing, and other inputs into valuation of the obligation, including discount and inflation rates, are also subject to change.67Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsEnvironmental CostsIn addition to asset retirement obligations discussed above, we have certain obligations to complete environmental-related projects. These projects are primarily related to cleanup at domestic refineries, underground storage sites and nonoperated sites. Future environmental remediation costs are difficult to estimate because they are subject to change due to such factors as the uncertain magnitude of cleanup costs, timing and extent of such remedial actions that may be required, and the determination of our liability in proportion to that of other responsible parties.Intangible Assets and GoodwillAt December 31, 2021, we had $715 million of intangible assets that we have determined to have indefinite useful lives, and therefore do not amortize. The judgmental determination that an intangible asset has an indefinite useful life is continuously evaluated. If, due to changes in facts and circumstances, management determines these intangible assets have finite useful lives, amortization will commence at that time on a prospective basis. As long as these intangible assets are determined to have indefinite lives, they will be subject to at least annual impairment tests that require management’s judgment of their estimated fair value.At December 31, 2021, we had $1.5 billion of goodwill primarily related to past business combinations. Goodwill is not amortized. Instead, goodwill is subject to at least annual tests for impairment at a reporting unit level. A reporting unit is an operating segment or a component that is one level below an operating segment, and it is determined primarily based on the manner in which the business is managed.We perform our annual goodwill impairment test using a qualitative assessment and a quantitative assessment, if one is deemed necessary. As part of our qualitative assessment, we evaluate relevant events and circumstances that could affect the fair value of our reporting units, including macroeconomic conditions, overall industry and market considerations and regulatory changes, as well as company-specific market metrics, performance and events. The evaluation of company-specific events and circumstances includes evaluating changes in our stock price and cost of capital, actual and forecasted financial performance, as well as the effect of significant asset dispositions. If our qualitative assessment indicates it is likely the fair value of a reporting unit has declined below its carrying value (including goodwill), a quantitative assessment is performed.When a quantitative assessment is performed, management applies judgment in determining the estimated fair values of the reporting units because quoted market prices for our reporting units are not available. Management uses available information to make this fair value determination, including estimated future cash flows, cost of capital, observed market earnings multiples of comparable companies, our common stock price and associated total company market capitalization. We completed our annual qualitative assessment of goodwill as of October 1, 2021, and concluded that the fair values of our reporting units exceeded their respective carrying values (including goodwill). A decline in the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting units in the future could result in an impairment. As such, we continue to monitor for indicators of impairment until our next annual impairment assessment is performed. See Note 9—Impairments, and Note 16—Fair Value Measurements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information regarding the goodwill impairment we recorded in the first quarter of 2020. 68Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsTax Assets and LiabilitiesOur operations are subject to various taxes, including federal, state and foreign income taxes, property taxes, and transactional taxes such as excise, sales and use, value-added and payroll taxes. We record tax liabilities based on our assessment of existing tax laws and regulations. The recording of tax liabilities requires significant judgment and estimates. We recognize the financial statement effects of an income tax position when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination by a taxing authority. A contingent liability related to a transactional tax claim is recorded if the loss is both probable and reasonably estimable. Actual incurred tax liabilities can vary from our estimates for a variety of reasons, including different interpretations of tax laws and regulations and different assessments of the amount of tax due.In determining our income tax expense (benefit), we assess the likelihood our deferred tax assets will be recovered through future taxable income. Valuation allowances reduce deferred tax assets to an amount that will, more likely than not, be realized. Judgment is required in estimating the amount of valuation allowance, if any, that should be recorded against our deferred tax assets. Based on our historical taxable income, our expectations for the future, and available tax-planning strategies, we expect our net deferred tax assets will more likely than not be realized as offsets to reversing deferred tax liabilities and as reductions to future taxable income. If our actual results of operations differ from such estimates or our estimates of future taxable income change, the valuation allowance may need to be revised.New tax laws and regulations, as well as changes to existing tax laws and regulations, are continuously being proposed or promulgated. The implementation of future legislative and regulatory tax initiatives could result in increased income tax liabilities that cannot be predicted at this time.Projected Benefit Obligations Calculation of the projected benefit obligations for our defined benefit pension and postretirement plans impacts the obligations on the balance sheet and the amount of benefit expense in the statement of operations. The actuarial calculation of projected benefit obligations and company contribution requirements involves judgment about uncertain future events, including estimated retirement dates, salary levels at retirement, mortality rates, lump-sum election rates, rates of return on plan assets, future interest rates, future health care cost-trend rates, and rates of utilization of health care services by retirees. We engage outside actuarial firms to assist in the calculation of these projected benefit obligations and company contribution requirements due to the specialized nature of these calculations. As financial accounting rules and the pension plan funding regulations promulgated by governmental agencies have different objectives and requirements, the actuarial methods and assumptions for the two purposes differ in certain important respects. Ultimately, we will be required to fund all promised benefits under pension and postretirement benefit plans not funded by plan assets or investment returns, but the judgmental assumptions used in the actuarial calculations significantly affect periodic financial statements and funding patterns over time. Benefit expense is particularly sensitive to the discount rate and return on plan assets assumptions. A one percentage-point decrease in the discount rate assumption used for the plan obligation would increase annual benefit expense by an estimated $60 million, while a one percentage-point decrease in the return on plan assets assumption would increase annual benefit expense by an estimated $40 million. In determining the discount rate, we use yields on high-quality fixed income investments with payments matched to the estimated distributions of benefits from our plans.The expected weighted-average long-term rate of return for worldwide pension plan assets was approximately 6% for both 2021 and 2020, while the actual weighted-average rate of return was 10% in 2021 and 12% in 2020. For the past ten years, our actual weighted-average rate of return for worldwide pension plan assets was 10%.69Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsGUARANTOR FINANCIAL INFORMATIONAt December 31, 2021, Phillips 66 had $10.3 billion of senior unsecured notes outstanding guaranteed by Phillips 66 Company, a direct, wholly owned operating subsidiary of Phillips 66. Phillips 66 conducts substantially all of its operations through subsidiaries, including Phillips 66 Company, and those subsidiaries generate substantially all of its operating income and cash flows. The guarantees (1) are unsecured obligations of Phillips 66 Company, (2) rank equally with all of Phillips 66 Company’s other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness, and (3) are full and unconditional.Summarized financial information of Phillips 66 and Phillips 66 Company (the Obligor Group) is presented on a combined basis. Intercompany transactions among the members of the Obligor Group have been eliminated. The financial information of non-guarantor subsidiaries has been excluded from the summarized financial information. Significant intercompany transactions and receivable/payable balances between the Obligor Group and non-guarantor subsidiaries are presented separately in the summarized financial information.

The realized refining margins are adjusted to include our proportional share of our joint venture refineries’ realized margins, as well as to exclude those items that are not representative of the underlying operating performance of a period, which we call “special items.” The realized refining margins are converted to a per-barrel basis by dividing them by total refinery processed inputs (primarily crude oil) measured on a barrel basis, including our share of inputs processed by our joint venture refineries. Our realized refining margin per barrel is intended to be comparable with industry refining margins, which are known as “crack spreads.” As discussed in “Executive Overview and Business Environment—Business Environment,” industry crack spreads measure the difference between market prices for refined petroleum products and crude oil. We believe realized refining margin per barrel calculated on a similar basis as industry crack spreads provides a useful measure of how well we performed relative to benchmark industry refining margins.The GAAP performance measure most directly comparable to realized refining margin per barrel is the Refining segment’s “income (loss) before income taxes per barrel.” Realized refining margin per barrel excludes items that are typically included in a manufacturer’s gross margin, such as depreciation and operating expenses, and other items used to determine income (loss) before income taxes, such as general and administrative expenses. It also includes our proportional share of joint venture refineries’ realized refining margins and excludes special items. Because realized refining margin per barrel is calculated in this manner, and because realized refining margin per barrel may be defined differently by other companies in our industry, it has limitations as an analytical tool.

The realized marketing fuel margins are adjusted to exclude those items that are not representative of the underlying operating performance of a period, which we call “special items.” The realized marketing fuel margins are converted to a per-barrel basis by dividing them by sales volumes measured on a barrel basis. We believe realized marketing fuel margin per barrel demonstrates the value uplift our marketing operations provide by optimizing the placement and ultimate sale of our refineries’ fuel production.Within the M&S segment, the GAAP performance measure most directly comparable to realized marketing fuel margin per barrel is the marketing business’ “income before income taxes per barrel.” Realized marketing fuel margin per barrel excludes items that are typically included in gross margin, such as depreciation and operating expenses, and other items used to determine income before income taxes, such as general and administrative expenses. Because realized marketing fuel margin per barrel excludes these items, and because realized marketing fuel margin per barrel may be defined differently by other companies in our industry, it has limitations as an analytical tool.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKFinancial Instrument Market RiskWe and certain of our subsidiaries are exposed to market risks produced by changes in the prices of crude oil, refined petroleum product, NGL, natural gas, renewable feedstock and electric power, as well as fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. We and certain of our subsidiaries may hold and use derivative contracts to manage these risks.Commodity Price RiskGenerally, our policy is to remain exposed to the market prices of commodities. Consistent with this policy, we use derivative contracts to convert our exposure from fixed-price sales or purchase contracts, often specified in contracts with refined petroleum product customers, back to floating market prices. We also use futures, forwards, swaps and options in various markets to accomplish the following objectives:•Balance physical systems or meet our refinery requirements and market demand. In addition to cash settlement prior to contract expiration, certain exchange-traded futures may be settled by physical delivery of the underlying commodity.•Enable us to use the market knowledge gained from our physical commodity market activities to capture market opportunities, such as moving physical commodities to more profitable locations, storing commodities to capture seasonal or time premiums, and blending commodities to capture quality upgrades. Derivatives may be utilized to optimize these activities. •Manage the risk to our cash flows from price exposures on specific crude oil, refined petroleum product, NGL, renewable feedstock and natural gas transactions.These objectives optimize the value of our supply chain and may reduce our exposure to fluctuations in market prices.Our use of derivative instruments is governed by an “Authority Limitations” document approved by our Board of Directors. This document prohibits the use of highly leveraged derivatives or derivative instruments without sufficient market liquidity for comparable valuations, and establishes Value at Risk (VaR) limits. Compliance with these limits is monitored daily by our global risk group. We use a VaR model to estimate the loss in fair value that could potentially result on a single day from the effect of adverse changes in market conditions on the derivative commodity instruments held or issued. Using Monte Carlo simulation, a 95% confidence level and a one-day holding period, the VaR for derivative commodity instruments issued or held at December 31, 2021 and 2020, was immaterial to our cash flows and results of operations.75Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsInterest Rate RiskOur use of fixed- or variable-rate debt directly exposes us to interest rate risk. Fixed-rate debt, such as our senior notes, exposes us to changes in the fair value of our debt due to changes in market interest rates. Fixed-rate debt also exposes us to the risk that we may need to refinance maturing debt with new debt at higher rates, or that we may be obligated to pay rates higher than the current market. Variable-rate debt, such as our floating-rate notes or borrowings under our revolving credit facility, exposes us to short-term changes in market rates that impact our interest expense. The following tables provide information about our debt instruments that are sensitive to changes in U.S. interest rates. These tables present principal cash flows and related weighted-average interest rates by expected maturity dates. Weighted-average variable rates are based on effective rates at each reporting date. The carrying amount of our floating-rate debt approximates its fair value. The fair value of the fixed-rate financial instruments is estimated based on observable market prices.Millions of Dollars, Except as IndicatedExpected Maturity DateFixed Rate MaturityAverage Interest RateFloating Rate MaturityAverage Interest RateYear-End 20212022$1,000 4.30 %$450 0.98 %2023500 3.70 — — 20241,100 1.32 — — 20251,150 3.74 — — 20261,000 2.43 — — Remaining years9,026 4.31 25 0.70 Total$13,776 $475 Fair value$15,353 $475 Millions of Dollars, Except as IndicatedExpected Maturity DateFixed Rate MaturityAverage Interest RateFloating Rate MaturityAverage Interest RateYear-End 20202021$— — %$965 1.05 %20222,000 4.30 — — 2023500 3.70 500 1.40 20241,100 1.32 450 0.84 20251,150 3.74 — — Remaining years9,026 4.22 25 0.76 Total$13,776 $1,940 Fair value$15,597 $1,940 Foreign Currency RiskWe are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations related to our international operations.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSManagement’s Discussion and Analysis is the company’s analysis of its financial performance and financial condition, and of significant trends that may affect future performance. It should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.The terms “earnings” and “loss” as used in Management’s Discussion and Analysis refer to net income (loss) attributable to Phillips 66. The terms “results,” “before-tax income” or “before-tax loss” as used in Management’s Discussion and Analysis refer to income (loss) before income taxes. EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW AND BUSINESS ENVIRONMENTPhillips 66 is a diversified energy company with Midstream, Chemicals, Refining, and Marketing and Specialties (M&S) operating segments. At December 31, 2022, we had total assets of $76.4 billion.Executive OverviewWe reported earnings of $11 billion and generated $10.8 billion in cash from operating activities for the full year of 2022. During 2022, we used available cash to pay down $2.4 billion in debt, fund capital expenditures and investments of $2.2 billion, pay dividends on our common stock of $1.8 billion and repurchase $1.5 billion of our common stock. We ended 2022 with $6.1 billion of cash and cash equivalents and approximately $6.7 billion of total committed capacity available under our credit facilities.DCP Midstream, LLC (DCP Midstream) and Gray Oak Holdings LLC (Gray Oak Holdings) MergerOn August 17, 2022, we announced a realignment of our economic and governance interests in DCP Midstream, LP (DCP LP) and Gray Oak Pipeline, LLC (Gray Oak Pipeline) resulting from the merger of DCP Midstream and Gray Oak Holdings. In connection with the merger, we were delegated DCP Midstream’s governance rights over DCP LP and its general partner entities, referred to as DCP Midstream Class A Segment. Additionally, Enbridge Inc., our co-venturer, was delegated governance rights over Gray Oak Pipeline, referred to as DCP Midstream Class B Segment. In connection with the merger of DCP Midstream and Gray Oak Holdings, our NGL and Other business includes DCP Midstream Class A Segment, DCP Sand Hills Pipeline, LLC (DCP Sand Hills) and DCP Southern Hills Pipeline, LLC (DCP Southern Hills). Prior to August 18, 2022, our investments in DCP Midstream, DCP Sand Hills and DCP Southern Hills were accounted for using the equity method. We account for our remaining investment in Gray Oak Pipeline, now held through DCP Midstream Class B Segment, using the equity method.See Note 3—DCP Midstream, LLC and Gray Oak Holdings LLC Merger, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information on the merger of DCP Midstream and Gray Oak Holdings.40Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsDCP LP Public Common Unit Acquisition AgreementOn January 5, 2023, we entered into a definitive agreement with DCP LP, its subsidiaries and its general partner entities, pursuant to which one of our wholly owned subsidiaries will merge with and into DCP LP, with DCP LP surviving as a Delaware limited partnership. Under the terms of the agreement, at the effective time of the merger, each publicly held common unit representing a limited partner interest in DCP LP (other than the common units owned by DCP LP and DCP Midstream GP, LP) issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective time will be converted into the right to receive $41.75 per common unit in cash, without interest. The merger will increase our economic interest in DCP LP from 43.3% to 86.8%. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2023, subject to customary closing conditions. The transaction was unanimously approved by the board of the general partner of DCP LP, based on the unanimous approval and recommendation of its special committee comprised entirely of independent directors after evaluation of the transaction by the special committee in consultation with independent financial and legal advisors. Concurrently with the execution of the agreement, affiliates of Phillips 66, which together own greater than a majority of the outstanding DCP LP common units, delivered their consent to approve the transaction. As a result, DCP LP has not solicited and is not soliciting approval of the transaction by any other holders of DCP LP common units. See Note 29—DCP Midstream Class A Segment, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information on the common unit acquisition agreement.Phillips 66 Partners MergerOn March 9, 2022, we completed the merger between us and Phillips 66 Partners LP (Phillips 66 Partners). The merger resulted in the acquisition of all limited partnership interests in Phillips 66 Partners not already owned by us. Upon closing, Phillips 66 Partners became a wholly owned subsidiary of Phillips 66 and its common units are no longer publicly traded. See Note 30—Phillips 66 Partners LP, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information on this merger transaction.CEO TransitionOn April 12, 2022, Greg C. Garland, announced his intention to retire from his position as Chief Executive Officer of Phillips 66, effective July 1, 2022. Mr. Garland continues to serve as Executive Chairman of the Board with an expected retirement date from this position in 2024. Mark E. Lashier was promoted to the position of President and Chief Executive Officer effective July 1, 2022.We continue to focus on the following strategic priorities:•Operating Excellence. Our commitment to operating excellence guides everything we do. We are committed to protecting the health and safety of everyone who has a role in our operations and the communities in which we operate. Continuous improvement in safety, environmental stewardship, reliability and cost efficiency is a fundamental requirement for our company and employees. We employ rigorous training and audit programs to drive ongoing improvement in both personal and process safety as we strive for zero incidents. In 2022, we achieved a combined workforce total recordable rate of 0.11.Since we cannot control commodity prices, controlling operating expenses and overhead costs, within the context of our commitment to safety and environmental stewardship, is a high priority. We continue to progress our multi-year business transformation initiative focused on identifying and implementing opportunities to improve our cost structure enterprise wide. We are executing on our initiatives to achieve a sustainable run-rate cost reduction of at least $800 million and a sustaining capital reduction of at least $200 million per year by the end of 2023.We are committed to protecting the environment and strive to reduce our environmental footprint throughout our operations. Optimizing utilization rates and product yield at our refineries through reliable and safe operations enables us to capture the value available in the market in terms of prices and margins. During 2022, our worldwide refining crude oil capacity utilization rate was 90% and our worldwide refining clean product yield was 84%.41Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements•Growth. A disciplined capital allocation process ensures we invest in projects that are expected to generate competitive returns. Our strategy primarily focuses on investing in high-return growth opportunities in the Midstream and Chemicals segments, as well as our investments in renewable fuels projects to advance a lower-carbon future. In 2023, we have budgeted $2 billion in capital expenditures and investments, which includes $1.1 billion of growth capital. Approximately 50% of growth capital is expected to support lower-carbon opportunities. In Midstream, we have budgeted $639 million for capital expenditures and investments, of which $310 million is for growth capital projects directed towards enhancing our integrated natural gas liquids (NGL) value chain from wellhead to market. In Refining, we have budgeted $1.1 billion for capital expenditures and investments, of which $448 million is for the continued conversion of the San Francisco Refinery in Rodeo, California into a renewable fuels facility. In Chemicals, our share of expected self-funded capital spending by Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC (CPChem) is $925 million, of which $702 million is for growth capital projects. CPChem plans to use its growth capital to fund development of its petrochemical projects in the U.S. Gulf Coast and Qatar, as well as expand its propylene splitting capacity and normal alpha olefins production.As part of our strategy to grow our Midstream NGL business, on January 5, 2023, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire all of the publicly held common units of DCP LP, which will increase our economic interest in DCP LP from 43.3% to 86.8% at closing. This transaction will be accounted for as an equity transaction and is expected to close in the second quarter of 2023, subject to customary closing conditions. We expect to fund this transaction with a combination of cash and debt.•Returns. We plan to enhance Refining returns by focusing on low-capital, higher-return projects that increase asset reliability, improve market capture and reduce costs. Our M&S segment will continue to develop and enhance our retail network, including energy transition opportunities.•Distributions. We believe shareholder value is enhanced through, among other things, a secure, competitive and growing dividend, complemented by share repurchases. In 2022, we paid $1.8 billion of dividends on our common stock. In the second quarter of 2022, we increased our quarterly dividend by 5% to $0.97 per common share. In the first quarter of 2023, we increased our quarterly dividend by 8% to $1.05 per common share. Regular dividends demonstrate the confidence our Board of Directors and management have in our capital structure and operations’ capability to generate free cash flow throughout the business cycle. In the second quarter of 2022, we resumed repurchasing shares under our share repurchase program. In 2022, we repurchased $1.5 billion, or 16.6 million shares, of our common stock. On November 7, 2022, our Board of Directors approved a $5 billion increase to our share repurchase program, bringing the total amount of share repurchases authorized by our Board of Directors since July 2012 to an aggregate of $20 billion. At the discretion of our Board of Directors, we are targeting to return $10 billion to $12 billion to our shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases in the period from July 1, 2022 through December 31, 2024. The amount and timing of future dividend payments and the level and timing of future share repurchases will depend on various factors including our share price, results of operations, financial condition and cash required for future business plans.•High-Performing Organization. We strive to attract, develop and retain individuals with the knowledge and skills to implement our business strategy and who support our values and culture. Throughout the company, we focus on promoting an inclusive workplace that enables our diverse workforce to innovate, create value and deliver extraordinary performance. We also focus on getting results in the right way and embracing our values as a common bond, and we believe success is both what we do and how we do it. We encourage collaboration throughout our company, while valuing differences, respecting diversity, and creating a great place to work. We foster an environment of learning and development through structured programs focused on enhancing functional and technical skills where employees are engaged in our business and committed to their own, as well as the company’s, success.42Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsBusiness EnvironmentThe Midstream segment includes our Transportation and NGL businesses. Our Transportation business contains fee-based operations not directly exposed to commodity price risk. Our NGL business, including DCP Midstream Class A Segment, DCP Sand Hills and DCP Southern Hills from August 18, 2022, forward, contains both fee-based operations and operations directly impacted by NGL, natural gas and condensate prices. During 2022, NGL and natural gas prices increased, compared with 2021, supported by increasing liquified natural gas exports and higher crude oil prices. The Chemicals segment consists of our 50% equity investment in CPChem. The chemicals and plastics industry is mainly a commodity-based industry where the margins for key products are based on supply and demand, as well as cost factors. Compared with 2021, the benchmark high-density polyethylene chain margin decreased significantly in 2022, due to soft demand and increasing capacity, resulting in lower plant operating rates.Our Refining segment results are driven by several factors, including market crack spreads, refinery throughput, feedstock costs, product yields, turnaround activity, and other operating costs. The price of U.S. benchmark crude oil, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) at Cushing, Oklahoma, increased to an average of $94.44 per barrel during 2022, compared with an average of $67.96 per barrel in 2021. Market crack spreads are used as indicators of refining margins and measure the difference between market prices for refined petroleum products and crude oil. Worldwide market crack spreads increased to an average of $34.26 per barrel during 2022, compared with an average of $17.09 per barrel in 2021. The increases in crude oil prices and market crack spreads were primarily driven by improving demand for refined petroleum products, as economic activities gradually recovered as the impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic moderated, as well as tightening supply due to the Russia-Ukraine war and refinery closures that occurred during the pandemic.Results for our M&S segment depend largely on marketing fuel and lubricant margins and sales volumes of our refined petroleum products. While marketing fuel and lubricant margins are primarily driven by market factors, largely determined by the relationship between supply and demand, marketing fuel margins, in particular, are influenced by trends in spot prices, and where applicable, retail prices for refined petroleum products in the regions and countries where we operate. 43Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsRESULTS OF OPERATIONSBasis of PresentationEffective August 18, 2022, forward, in connection with the merger of DCP Midstream and Gray Oak Holdings we began consolidating the results of DCP Midstream Class A Segment, DCP Sand Hills and DCP Southern Hills. As a result of this transaction, we began presenting the results of DCP Midstream Class A Segment within the results of our NGL and Other business. Prior periods also have been updated to reflect the results of our equity investment in DCP Midstream prior to August 18, 2022, within the results of our NGL and Other business. See Note 3—DCP Midstream, LLC and Gray Oak Holdings LLC Merger, Note 4—Business Combination, and Note 18—Fair Value Measurements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information on the merger of DCP Midstream and Gray Oak Holdings.Effective October 1, 2022, we changed the organizational structure of the internal financial information reviewed by our President and Chief Executive Officer, and determined this resulted in a change in the composition of our operating segments. As part of the realignment, we moved the results and net assets of our Merey Sweeny vacuum distillation and delayed coker units at our Sweeny Refinery and the isomerization unit at our Lake Charles Refinery from our Midstream segment to our Refining segment. Additionally, commissions charged to the Refining segment by the M&S segment related to sales of specialty products were eliminated and the costs of the sales organization were reclassified from the M&S segment to the Refining segment. Further, we are no longer presenting disaggregated business line results for our Chemicals and M&S segments to align with changes in our internal financial reporting.Effective January 1, 2022, we began reporting our investment in NOVONIX Limited (NOVONIX) as a separate business line within our Midstream segment. Previously it was included in our NGL and Other business line.The segment realignment and business line reporting changes are presented for the year ended December 31, 2022, with the prior periods recast for comparability.Consolidated ResultsA summary of income (loss) before income taxes by business segment with a reconciliation to net income (loss) attributable to Phillips 66 follows: Millions of DollarsYear Ended December 31 202220212020Midstream$4,734 1,500 (116)Chemicals856 1,844 635 Refining7,816 (2,353)(6,023)Marketing and Specialties2,402 1,723 1,421 Corporate and Other(1,169)(974)(881)Income (loss) before income taxes14,639 1,740 (4,964)Income tax expense (benefit)3,248 146 (1,250)Net income (loss)11,391 1,594 (3,714)Less: net income attributable to noncontrolling interests367 277 261 Net income (loss) attributable to Phillips 66$11,024 1,317 (3,975)44Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements2022 vs. 2021 Net income attributable to Phillips 66 for the year ended December 31, 2022, was $11,024 million, compared with $1,317 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The improvement was primarily due to higher realized refining margins, an aggregate before-tax gain of $3,013 million recognized in our Midstream segment in connection with the merger of DCP Midstream and Gray Oak Holdings, lower impairments in the Refining segment, and improved international marketing fuel margins. These improvements were partially offset by an increase in income tax expense, lower equity earnings from CPChem, and an unrealized decrease in the fair value of our investment in NOVONIX.2021 vs. 2020 Net income attributable to Phillips 66 for the year ended December 31, 2021, was $1,317 million, compared with net loss attributable to Phillips 66 of $3,975 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The improvement was primarily due to lower impairments, improved realized refining margins and higher equity earnings from CPChem, partially offset by income tax impacts from improved results.See Note 4—Business Combination, and Note 18—Fair Value Measurements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information on the gain recognized in connection with the merger of DCP Midstream and Gray Oak Holdings. See Note 11—Impairments, and Note 18—Fair Value Measurements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for information on impairments recorded in 2021 and 2020. See Note 23—Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information on income taxes.See the “Segment Results” section for additional information on our segment results.45Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsStatement of Operations Analysis2022 vs. 2021 Sales and other operating revenues and purchased crude oil and products increased 52% and 47%, respectively, in 2022. These increases were mainly due to higher prices for refined petroleum products, crude oil and NGL.Other income increased $2,283 million in 2022, primarily due to an aggregate gain of $3,013 million recognized in our Midstream segment in connection with the merger of DCP Midstream and Gray Oak Holdings. The impact of this gain was partially offset by an unrealized investment loss on our investment in NOVONIX, compared with an unrealized gain in 2021. See Note 4—Business Combination, and Note 18—Fair Value Measurements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information on the aggregate gain. See Note 8—Investments, Loans and Long-Term Receivables, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information regarding our investment in NOVONIX.Operating expenses increased 19% in 2022, mainly attributable to higher utility costs driven by increased natural gas and power prices and higher turnaround and other maintenance expenses.Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 24% in 2022, primarily driven by higher employee-related expenses, restructuring costs due to our business transformation and increased selling expenses driven by rising refined petroleum product prices.Impairments decreased 96% in 2022 primarily due to a before-tax impairment of $1,298 million recorded in the third quarter of 2021 associated with our Alliance Refinery. See Note 11—Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information.Taxes other than income taxes increased 29% in 2022, primarily due to tax credits received from renewable diesel blending activity at our San Francisco Refinery in the third quarter of 2021, as well as higher property and other taxes.Income tax expense increased $3,102 million in 2022 primarily due to improved results. See Note 23—Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for more information regarding our income taxes.Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests increased 32% in 2022. The increase was primarily driven by the consolidation of DCP Midstream Class A Segment, DCP Sand Hills and DCP Southern Hills, which resulted in us reflecting the additional noncontrolling interest owned by the public common and preferred unitholders of DCP LP, as well as Enbridge’s noncontrolling interest in DCP Midstream Class A Segment, on our consolidated statement of operations. The increase was partially offset by a decrease due to the merger between us and Phillips 66 Partners that occurred in the first quarter of 2022 and resulted in Phillips 66 Partners becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of Phillips 66. See Note 3—DCP Midstream, LLC and Gray Oak Holdings LLC Merger, and Note 30—Phillips 66 Partners LP, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information on the merger of DCP Midstream and Gray Oak Holdings and the Phillips 66 Partners merger, respectively.46Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements2021 vs. 2020 Sales and other operating revenues and purchased crude oil and products increased 74% and 77%, respectively, in 2021. These increases were mainly due to higher prices for refined petroleum products, crude oil and NGL, as well as increased volumes for refined petroleum products and crude oil. Equity in earnings of affiliates increased $1,713 million in 2021. The increase was primarily due to higher equity earnings from CPChem mainly driven by increased margins, WRB Refining LP (WRB) resulting from improved realized refining margins and higher refinery production, and Excel Paralubes LLC (Excel Paralubes) attributable to higher base oil margins. See Chemicals segment analysis in the “Segment Results” section for additional information on CPChem.Net gain on dispositions decreased 83% in 2021, mainly reflecting a before-tax gain of $84 million recognized in the second quarter of 2020 associated with a co-venturer’s acquisition of an ownership interest in the consolidated holding company that owned an interest in Gray Oak Pipeline. See Note 30—Phillips 66 Partners LP, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information.Other income increased $388 million in 2021, primarily driven by an unrealized gain of $365 million related to the change in fair value of our investment in NOVONIX, which we acquired in the third quarter of 2021. See Note 8—Investments, Loans and Long-Term Receivables, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information on our investment in NOVONIX.Operating expenses increased 13% in 2021, mainly attributable to higher utility costs driven by increased commodity prices, higher employee-related expenses, and increased maintenance and repair costs.Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 13% in 2021, primarily driven by higher selling expenses due to rising refined petroleum product prices and demand, increased employee-related expenses, and a benefit received from a legal settlement in the first quarter of 2020.Depreciation and amortization increased 15% in 2021, mainly due to asset retirements related to the shutdown of our Alliance Refinery. See Note 9—Properties, Plants and Equipment, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information regarding asset retirements related to the Alliance Refinery. Impairments decreased 65% in 2021. See Note 11—Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information regarding impairments.Taxes other than income taxes decreased 12% in 2021, primarily driven by tax credits received from renewable diesel blending activity at our San Francisco Refinery in 2021, and lower property and franchise taxes.Interest and debt expense increased 16% in 2021, primarily driven by lower capitalized interest due to the completion of capital projects and the placement of assets into service, as well as higher average debt principal balances resulting from new debt issuances in the second and fourth quarters of 2020.We had income tax expense of $146 million in 2021, compared with an income tax benefit of $1,250 million in 2020, primarily due to before-tax income in 2021 versus a before-tax loss in 2020.

These activities are mainly in the United States. This segment also includes our investment in NOVONIX.In connection with the merger of DCP Midstream and Gray Oak Holdings, the results of our Transportation business reflect a decrease in our indirect economic interest in Gray Oak Pipeline to 6.5% from August 18, 2022, forward. Prior to August 18, 2022, the Transportation results presented in the table above reflect Gray Oak Holdings’ 65% economic interest in Gray Oak Pipeline. In addition, the results of our NGL and Other business include the consolidated results of DCP Midstream Class A Segment, DCP Sand Hills and DCP Southern Hills from August 18, 2022, forward. Prior to August 18, 2022, our investments in DCP Midstream, DCP Sand Hills and DCP Southern Hills were accounted for using the equity method. As a result of the merger and consolidation, equity earnings from our investment in DCP Midstream prior to the merger have been included with the results of our NGL and Other business.48Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements2022 vs. 2021 Results from our Midstream segment increased $3,234 million in 2022, compared with 2021. Results from our Transportation business increased $498 million in 2022, compared with 2021. The increase was primarily due to a before-tax impairment of $198 million recorded in the first quarter of 2021 related to Phillips 66 Partners’ decision to exit the Liberty Pipeline project, a before-tax gain of $182 million from the transfer of a 35.75% indirect economic interest in Gray Oak Pipeline to our co-venturer as part of the merger of DCP Midstream and Gray Oak Holdings, and lower depreciation and amortization expense from logistic assets that were retired in the fourth quarter of 2021 as part of the planned conversion of the Alliance Refinery to a terminal.Results from our NGL and Other business increased $3,548 million in 2022, compared with 2021. The increase was primarily due to before-tax gains totaling $2,831 million recognized from remeasuring our previously held equity investments in DCP Midstream, DCP Sand Hills and DCP Southern Hills to their fair values in connection with the merger of DCP Midstream and Gray Oak Holdings. Additionally, the increased results reflect the consolidation of DCP Midstream Class A Segment, DCP Sand Hills and DCP Southern Hills from August 18, 2022, forward, as well as improved Sweeny Hub results.In 2022, the fair value of our investment in NOVONIX decreased by $442 million compared with an increase of $370 million in 2021. We acquired this investment in September 2021. See Note 11—Impairments, and Note 8—Investments, Loans and Long-Term Receivables, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information on impairments and our investment in NOVONIX, respectively.

See the “Executive Overview and Business Environment” section for information on market factors impacting 2022 results.2021 vs. 2020 Midstream’s results increased $1,616 million in 2021, compared with 2020. Results from our Transportation business increased $170 million in 2021, compared with 2020. The increase was primarily due to improved earnings from our equity affiliates, lower asset impairments, and increased pipeline volumes and tariffs. These increases were partially offset by a before-tax gain of $84 million recognized in the second quarter of 2020 associated with a co-venturer’s acquisition of an ownership interest in the consolidated holding company that owned an interest in Gray Oak Pipeline, and increased depreciation and amortization expense from logistic assets that were retired in the fourth quarter of 2021 as part of the planned conversion of the Alliance Refinery to a terminal.Results from our NGL and Other business increased $1,076 million in 2021, compared with 2020. The increase in 2021 reflects a $1,161 million before-tax impairment of our investment in DCP Midstream recorded in the first quarter of 2020, partially offset by higher utility costs due to increased natural gas prices. The fair value of our investment in NOVONIX increased $370 million in 2021, compared with 2020.

CPChem uses NGL and other feedstocks to produce petrochemicals. These products are then marketed and sold or used as feedstocks to produce plastics and other chemicals. CPChem produces and markets ethylene and other olefin products. Ethylene produced is primarily consumed within CPChem for the production of polyethylene, normal alpha olefins and polyethylene pipe. CPChem manufactures and markets aromatics and styrenics products, such as benzene, cyclohexane, styrene and polystyrene, as well as manufactures and/or markets a variety of specialty chemical products. Unless otherwise noted, amounts referenced below reflect our net 50% interest in CPChem.2022 vs. 2021 Before-tax income from the Chemicals segment decreased $988 million in 2022, compared with 2021. The decrease was primarily due to lower margins driven by decreased sale prices, higher feedstock and utility costs, as well as decreased results from CPChem’s equity affiliates.See the “Executive Overview and Business Environment” section for information on market factors impacting CPChem’s 2022 results.2021 vs. 2020 Before-tax income from the Chemicals segment increased $1,209 million in 2021, compared with 2020. The increase was primarily due to improved margins driven by increased sale prices reflecting strong demand and tight supply, partially offset by higher utility, turnaround, maintenance and repair costs.50Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsRefining Year Ended December 31 202220212020Millions of DollarsIncome (Loss) Before Income TaxesAtlantic Basin/Europe$2,402 1 (1,207)Gulf Coast2,091 (1,759)(1,964)Central Corridor2,415 72 (642)West Coast908 (667)(2,210)Worldwide$7,816 (2,353)(6,023)Dollars Per BarrelIncome (Loss) Before Income TaxesAtlantic Basin/Europe$12.05 0.01 (7.08)Gulf Coast10.29 (7.30)(9.18)Central Corridor24.64 0.75 (6.97)West Coast7.86 (5.90)(19.98)Worldwide12.69 (3.69)(10.26)Realized Refining Margins*Atlantic Basin/Europe$20.30 7.48 2.17 Gulf Coast18.25 5.65 2.64 Central Corridor24.96 9.65 7.17 West Coast24.31 7.70 3.43 Worldwide21.55 7.42 3.77 * See the “Non-GAAP Reconciliations” section for a reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure to the most directly comparable measure under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), income (loss) before income taxes per barrel.51Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsThousands of Barrels Daily Year Ended December 31 202220212020Operating StatisticsRefining operations*Atlantic Basin/EuropeCrude oil capacity537 537 537 Crude oil processed524 479 434 Capacity utilization (percent)98 %89 81 Refinery production549 522 470 Gulf Coast**Crude oil capacity529 720 769 Crude oil processed488 592 533 Capacity utilization (percent)92 %82 69 Refinery production565 662 586 Central CorridorCrude oil capacity531 531 530 Crude oil processed469 461 431 Capacity utilization (percent)88 %87 81 Refinery production487 476 446 West CoastCrude oil capacity364 364 364 Crude oil processed290 284 279 Capacity utilization (percent)80 %78 77 Refinery production315 308 301 WorldwideCrude oil capacity1,961 2,152 2,200 Crude oil processed1,771 1,816 1,677 Capacity utilization (percent)90 %84 76 Refinery production1,916 1,968 1,803 * Includes our share of equity affiliates.** Excludes operating statistics of the Alliance Refinery beginning on October 1, 2021.The Refining segment refines crude oil and other feedstocks into petroleum products, such as gasoline, distillates and aviation fuels, as well as renewable fuels, at 12 refineries in the United States and Europe. In the fourth quarter of 2021, we shut down our Alliance Refinery.2022 vs. 2021 Results from the Refining segment increased $10,169 million in 2022, compared with 2021. The improved results were primarily due to higher realized refining margins driven by improved market crack spreads, partially offset by higher operating costs. In addition, 2021 included a before-tax impairment of $1,288 million associated with our Alliance Refinery. See Note 11—Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information regarding this impairment.Our worldwide refining crude oil capacity utilization rate was 90% and 84% in 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase in 2022 was primarily driven by improved demand for refined petroleum products due to supply constraints caused by the conflict between Russia and Ukraine and easing of restrictions from the COVID-19 pandemic.See the “Executive Overview and Business Environment” section for information on industry crack spreads and other market factors impacting this year’s results.52Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements2021 vs. 2020 Results from the Refining segment increased $3,670 million in 2021, compared with 2020. The improved results in 2021 were primarily due to higher realized refining margins and lower asset impairments, partially offset by increased utility expenses and higher costs related to the shutdown of our Alliance Refinery. The improved realized refining margins in 2021 were mainly attributable to increased market crack spreads, partially offset by higher RIN costs, lower clean product differentials and decreased secondary products margins. See Note 11—Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information regarding impairments recorded in our Refining segment during 2021 and 2020.Our worldwide refining crude oil capacity utilization rate was 84% and 76% in 2021 and 2020, respectively.

During 2022, we generated $10.8 billion in cash from operations. We used available cash to pay down $2.4 billion in debt, fund capital expenditures and investments of $2.2 billion, pay dividends on our common stock of $1.8 billion and repurchase $1.5 billion of our common stock. During 2022, cash and cash equivalents increased $3 billion to $6.1 billion.Significant Sources of CapitalOperating ActivitiesDuring 2022, cash generated by operating activities was $10.8 billion, a $4.8 billion increase compared with 2021. The increase was primarily due to higher earnings resulting from improved realized refining margins, partially offset by working capital impacts and lower distributions from equity affiliates.During 2021, cash generated by operating activities was $6 billion, a $3.9 billion increase compared with 2020. The increase was primarily due to improved realized refining margins, a U.S. federal income tax refund of $1.1 billion received in the second quarter of 2021, and higher cash distributions from our equity affiliates, partially offset by higher operating expenses.Our short- and long-term operating cash flows are highly dependent upon refining and marketing margins, NGL prices and chemicals margins. Prices and margins in our industry are typically volatile, and are driven by market conditions over which we have little or no control. Absent other mitigating factors, as these prices and margins fluctuate, we would expect a corresponding change in our operating cash flows. The level and quality of output from our refineries also impact our cash flows. Factors such as operating efficiency, maintenance turnarounds, market conditions, feedstock availability, and weather conditions can affect output. We actively manage the operations of our refineries, and any variability in their operations typically has not been as significant to cash flows as that caused by margins and prices. Our worldwide refining crude oil capacity utilization was 90%, 84% and 76% in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Our worldwide refining clean product yield was 84%, 83% and 84% in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.Equity Affiliate Operating DistributionsOur operating cash flows are also impacted by distribution decisions made by our equity affiliates, including CPChem. Over the three years ended December 31, 2022, our operating cash flows included aggregate distributions from our equity affiliates of $6 billion, including $2.8 billion from CPChem. We cannot control the amount of future dividends from equity affiliates; therefore, future dividend payments by these equity affiliates are not assured.56Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsTax RefundsWe received a U.S. federal income tax refund of $1.1 billion in the second quarter of 2021. Credit Facilities and Commercial PaperPhillips 66 and Phillips 66 CompanyOn June 23, 2022, we entered into a new $5 billion revolving credit facility (the Facility) with Phillips 66 Company as the borrower and Phillips 66 as the guarantor and a scheduled maturity date of June 22, 2027. The Facility replaced our previous $5 billion revolving credit facility with Phillips 66 as the borrower and Phillips 66 Company as the guarantor. The Facility contains usual and customary covenants that are similar to the previous revolving credit facility, including a maximum consolidated net debt-to-capitalization ratio of 65% as of the last day of each fiscal quarter. We have the option to increase the overall capacity to $6 billion, subject to certain conditions. We also have the option to extend the scheduled maturity of the Facility for up to two additional one-year terms, subject to, among other things, the consent of the lenders holding the majority of the commitments and of each lender extending its commitment. Outstanding borrowings under the Facility bear interest at either (a) the Adjusted Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) (as described in the Facility) in effect from time to time plus the applicable margin; or (b) the reference rate (as described in the Facility) plus the applicable margin. The Facility also provides for customary fees, including commitment fees. The pricing levels for the commitment fees and interest-rate margins are determined based on the ratings in effect for our senior unsecured long-term debt from time to time. We may at any time prepay outstanding borrowings, in whole or in part, without premium or penalty. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, no amount had been drawn under our revolving credit facilities.Phillips 66 also has a $5 billion uncommitted commercial paper program for short-term working capital needs that is supported by the Facility. Commercial paper maturities are contractually limited to 365 days. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, no borrowings were outstanding under the program. Phillips 66 PartnersIn connection with entering into the Facility, we terminated Phillips 66 Partners’ $750 million revolving credit facility.DCP Midstream Class A SegmentDCP LP has a credit facility under its amended credit agreement (the Credit Agreement), with a borrowing capacity of up to $1.4 billion that matures on March 18, 2027. The Credit Agreement grants DCP LP the option to increase the revolving loan commitment by an aggregate principal amount of up to $500 million and to extend the term for up to two additional one-year periods, subject to requisite lender approval. Indebtedness under the Credit Agreement bears interest at either: (a) an adjusted SOFR (as described in the Credit Agreement) plus the applicable margin; or (b) the base rate (as described in the Credit Agreement) plus the applicable margin. The Credit Agreement also provides for customary fees, including commitment fees. The cost of borrowing under the Credit Agreement is determined by a ratings-based pricing grid based on DCP LP’s credit rating. At December 31, 2022, DCP LP had no borrowings outstanding under the Credit Agreement. At December 31, 2022, $10 million in letters of credit had been issued that are supported by the Credit Agreement.DCP LP has an accounts receivable securitization facility (the Securitization Facility) that provides for up to $350 million of borrowing capacity through August 2024 at an adjusted SOFR and includes an uncommitted option to increase the total commitments under the Securitization Facility by up to an additional $400 million. Under the Securitization Facility, certain of DCP LP’s wholly owned subsidiaries sell or contribute receivables to another of DCP LP’s consolidated subsidiaries, DCP Receivables LLC (DCP Receivables), a bankruptcy-remote special purpose entity created for the sole purpose of the Securitization Facility. At December 31, 2022, $40 million of borrowings were outstanding under the Securitization Facility, which are secured by its accounts receivable at DCP Receivables.57Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsTotal Committed Capacity AvailableAt December 31, 2022, we had approximately $6.7 billion of total committed capacity available under the credit facilities described above. At December 31, 2021, we had approximately $5.7 billion of total committed capacity available under our revolving credit facilities.Other Debt Issuances and FinancingsSenior Unsecured NotesIn November 2021, Phillips 66 closed its public offering of $1 billion aggregate principal amount of 3.300% senior unsecured notes due 2052.

The term loan agreement was repaid upon maturity in April 2022 without premium or penalty.In March 2020, we entered into a $1 billion 364-day delayed draw term loan agreement (the Facility) and borrowed $1 billion under the Facility shortly thereafter. In November 2020, we repaid $500 million of borrowings outstanding under the Facility, and the Facility was amended to extend the maturity date of the remaining $500 million to November 20, 2023. In September 2021, we repaid the outstanding borrowings of $500 million.Phillips 66 Availability of Debt FinancingWe have an A3 credit rating, with a stable outlook, from Moody’s Investors Service and a BBB+ credit rating, with a stable outlook, from Standard & Poor’s. These investment grade ratings have served to lower our borrowing costs and facilitate access to a variety of lenders. We do not have any ratings triggers on any of our corporate debt that would cause an automatic default, and thereby impact our access to liquidity, in the event of a rating downgrade by one or both rating agencies. Failure to maintain investment grade ratings could prohibit us from accessing the commercial paper market, although we would expect to be able to access funds under our liquidity facilities mentioned above.DCP LP Availability of Debt FinancingDCP LP has a BBB+ credit rating, with a stable outlook, from Standard and Poor’s; a BBB- credit rating, with a stable outlook, from Fitch Ratings; and a Ba1 credit rating, with a positive outlook, from Moody’s Investors Service. These ratings facilitate DCP LP access to a variety of lenders. DCP LP does not have any ratings triggers on any of its corporate debt that would cause an automatic default, and thereby impact access to liquidity, in the event of a rating downgrade by one or more rating agencies.59Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsOff-Balance Sheet ArrangementsLease Residual Value GuaranteesUnder the operating lease agreement for our headquarters facility in Houston, Texas, we have the option, at the end of the lease term in September 2025, to request to renew the lease, purchase the facility or assist the lessor in marketing it for resale. We have a residual value guarantee associated with the operating lease agreement with a maximum potential future exposure of $514 million at December 31, 2022. We also have residual value guarantees associated with railcar and airplane leases with maximum potential future exposures totaling $156 million. These leases have remaining terms of five to nine years.Dakota Access, LLC (Dakota Access) and Energy Transfer Crude Oil Company, LLC (ETCO)In 2020, the trial court presiding over litigation brought by the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe (the Tribe) ordered the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) addressing an easement under Lake Oahe in North Dakota. The court later vacated the easement. Although the easement is vacated, the USACE has no plans to stop pipeline operations while it proceeds with the EIS, and the Tribe’s request for a shutdown was denied in May 2021. In June 2021, the trial court dismissed the litigation entirely. Once the EIS is completed, new litigation or challenges may be filed.In February 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court (the Court) denied Dakota Access’ writ of certiorari requesting the Court to review the lower court’s decision to order the EIS and vacate the easement. Therefore, the requirement to prepare the EIS stands. Also in February 2022, the Tribe withdrew as a cooperating agency, causing the USACE to halt the EIS process while the USACE engaged with the Tribe on their reasons for withdrawing. The draft EIS process resumed in August 2022, and release is expected in Spring 2023.Dakota Access and ETCO have guaranteed repayment of senior unsecured notes issued by a wholly owned subsidiary of Dakota Access in March 2019. On April 1, 2022, Dakota Access’ wholly owned subsidiary repaid $650 million aggregate principal amount of its outstanding senior notes upon maturity. We funded our 25% share, or $163 million, with a capital contribution of $89 million in March 2022 and $74 million of distributions we elected not to receive from Dakota Access in the first quarter of 2022. At December 31, 2022, the aggregate principal amount outstanding of Dakota Access’ senior unsecured notes was $1.85 billion.In conjunction with the notes offering, Phillips 66 Partners, now a wholly owned subsidiary of Phillips 66, and its co-venturers in Dakota Access also provided a Contingent Equity Contribution Undertaking (CECU). Under the CECU, the co-venturers may be severally required to make proportionate equity contributions to Dakota Access if there is an unfavorable final judgment in the above-mentioned ongoing litigation. At December 31, 2022, our 25% share of the maximum potential equity contributions under the CECU was approximately $467 million.If the pipeline is required to cease operations, and should Dakota Access and ETCO not have sufficient funds to pay ongoing expenses, we could be required to support our 25% share of the ongoing expenses, including scheduled interest payments on the notes of approximately $20 million annually, in addition to the potential obligations under the CECU at December 31, 2022.See Note 15—Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information on our guarantees.60Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsCapital RequirementsCapital Expenditures and InvestmentsFor information about our capital expenditures and investments, see the “Capital Spending” section below. Debt FinancingOur debt balance at December 31, 2022, was $17.2 billion and our total debt-to-capital ratio was 34%. In December 2022, Phillips 66 repaid its 3.700% senior notes due April 2023 with an aggregate principal amount of $500 million.After our consolidation of DCP Midstream Class A Segment on August 17, 2022, DCP LP repaid $470 million of borrowings under its accounts receivable securitization and revolving credit facilities that were outstanding on the acquisition date.In April 2022, upon maturity, Phillips 66 repaid its 4.300% senior notes with an aggregate principal amount of $1.0 billion and Phillips 66 Partners repaid its $450 million term loan.See Note 14—Debt, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for our annual debt maturities over the next five years and more information on debt repayments.Debt ExchangeOn May 5, 2022, Phillips 66 Company, a wholly owned subsidiary of Phillips 66, completed offers to exchange (the Exchange Offers) all validly tendered notes of seven different series of notes issued by Phillips 66 Partners (collectively, the Old Notes), with an aggregate principal amount of approximately $3.5 billion, for notes issued by Phillips 66 Company (collectively, the New Notes). The New Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Phillips 66 and rank equally with Phillips 66 Company’s other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness, and the guarantees rank equally with Phillips 66’s other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness.Old Notes with an aggregate principal amount of approximately $3.2 billion were tendered in the Exchange Offers. The New Notes have the same interest rates, interest payment dates and maturity dates as the Old Notes. Holders that validly tendered before the end of the early participation period on April 19, 2022 (the Early Participation Date), received New Notes with an aggregate principal amount equivalent to the Old Notes, while holders that validly tendered after the Early Participation Date, but before the Expiration Date, received New Notes with an aggregate principal amount 3% less than the Old Notes. Substantially all of the Old Notes exchanged were tendered during the Early Participation Period.Joint Venture LoansStarting in 2020 and extending through the second quarter of 2022, we and our co-venturer provided member loans to WRB. By December 31, 2022, WRB had repaid all outstanding member loans. At December 31, 2021, our share of the outstanding member loan balance, including accrued interest, was $595 million. The need for additional loans to WRB in 2023 will depend on market conditions.DCP Midstream and Gray Oak Holdings MergerOn August 17, 2022, we and our co-venturer, Enbridge, agreed to merge DCP Midstream and Gray Oak Holdings with DCP Midstream as the surviving entity. As part of the merger, we made a net cash payment of $306 million.DCP LP Public Common Unit Acquisition AgreementOn January 5, 2023, we entered into a definitive agreement with DCP LP, its subsidiaries and its general partner entities, pursuant to which one of our wholly owned subsidiaries will merge with and into DCP LP, with DCP LP surviving as a Delaware limited partnership. Under the terms of the agreement, at the effective time of the merger, each publicly held common unit representing a limited partner interest in DCP LP (other than the common units owned by DCP LP and DCP Midstream GP, LP) issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective time will be converted into the right to receive $41.75 per common unit in cash, without interest. The merger will increase our economic interest in DCP LP from 43.3% to 86.8%. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2023, subject to customary closing conditions. 61Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsIf the merger is successfully completed, we will pay approximately $3.8 billion in cash consideration, which we expect to fund through a combination of cash generated from operating activities and debt. The transaction was unanimously approved by the board of the general partner of DCP LP, based on the unanimous approval and recommendation of its special committee comprised entirely of independent directors after evaluation of the transaction by the special committee in consultation with independent financial and legal advisors. Concurrently with the execution of the agreement, affiliates of Phillips 66, which together own greater than a majority of the outstanding DCP LP common units, delivered their consent to approve the transaction. As a result, DCP LP has not solicited and is not soliciting approval of the transaction by any other holders of DCP LP common units. See Note 3—DCP Midstream, LLC and Gray Oak Holdings LLC Merger and Note 29—DCP Midstream Class A Segment, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information on the merger of DCP Midstream and Gray Oak Holdings.DCP LP Cash Distributions to UnitholdersDCP LP’s partnership agreement requires that, within 45 days after the end of each quarter, DCP LP distributes all available cash. Since the merger on August 18, 2022, DCP LP made cash distributions of $51 million to common unitholders other than Phillips 66, $19 million to Series A preferred unitholders, $6 million to Series B preferred unitholders and $2 million to Series C preferred unitholders.

The distribution on the common units was paid on February 14, 2023, to unitholders of record on February 3, 2023. The Series B distribution will be paid on March 15, 2023, to unitholders of record on March 1, 2023. The Series C distribution will be paid on April 17, 2023, to unitholders of record on April 3, 2023.DCP LP Preferred UnitsDCP LP redeemed its Series A preferred units with an aggregate liquidation preference of $500 million in December 2022. DCP LP funded this redemption from available cash and borrowings under its accounts receivable securitization facility.Merger with Phillips 66 PartnersOn March 9, 2022, we completed a merger between us and Phillips 66 Partners. The merger resulted in the acquisition of all limited partnership interests in Phillips 66 Partners not already owned by us in exchange for 41.8 million shares of Phillips 66 common stock issued from treasury stock. Phillips 66 Partners common unitholders received 0.50 shares of Phillips 66 common stock for each outstanding Phillips 66 Partners common unit. Phillips 66 Partners’ perpetual convertible preferred units were converted into common units at a premium to the original issuance price prior to being exchanged for Phillips 66 common stock. Upon closing, Phillips 66 Partners became a wholly owned subsidiary of Phillips 66 and its common units are no longer publicly traded. See Note 30—Phillips 66 Partners LP, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information on the merger transaction.DividendsOn February 8, 2023, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $1.05 per common share, representing an 8% increase. The dividend is payable March 1, 2023, to holders of record at the close of business on February 21, 2023. 62Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsShare RepurchasesIn March 2020, we announced that we had temporarily suspended our share repurchases to preserve liquidity in response to the global economic disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. We resumed purchasing shares under our share repurchase program in the second quarter of 2022. On November 7, 2022, our Board of Directors approved a $5 billion increase to our share repurchase program. Since July 2012, our Board of Directors has authorized an aggregate of $20 billion of repurchases of our outstanding common stock. The authorizations do not have expiration dates. Future share repurchases are expected to be funded primarily through available cash. We are not obligated to repurchase any shares of common stock pursuant to these authorizations and may commence, suspend or terminate repurchases at any time. In 2022, we repurchased 16.6 million shares at an aggregate cost of $1.5 billion. Since the inception of our share repurchase program in 2012, we have repurchased 175.9 million shares at an aggregate cost of $14 billion. Shares of stock repurchased are held as treasury shares.Employee Benefit Plan ContributionsDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, we contributed $125 million to our U.S. pension and other postretirement benefit plans and $23 million to our international pension plans.Contractual ObligationsOur contractual obligations primarily consist of purchase obligations, outstanding debt principal and interest obligations, operating and finance lease obligations, and asset retirement and environmental obligations.Purchase ObligationsOur purchase obligations represent agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable, legally binding and specify all significant terms. We expect these purchase obligations will be fulfilled with operating cash flows in the period when due. As of December 31, 2022, our purchase obligations totaled $106.5 billion, with $44.4 billion due within one year. The majority of our purchase obligations are market-based contracts, including exchanges and futures, for the purchase of products such as crude oil and raw NGL. The products are used to supply our refineries and fractionators and optimize our supply chain. At December 31, 2022, product purchase commitments with third parties and related parties were $54.6 billion and $26.1 billion, respectively. The remaining purchase obligations mainly represent agreements to access and utilize the capacity of third-party equipment and facilities, including pipelines and product terminals, to transport, process, treat, and store products, and our net share of purchase commitments for materials and services for jointly owned facilities where we are the operator.Debt Principal and Interest ObligationsAs of December 31, 2022, our aggregate principal amount of outstanding debt was $17.2 billion, with $529 million due within one year. Our obligations for interest on the debt totaled $10.2 billion, with $776 million due within one year.

Capital spending was primarily for the development of petrochemical projects on the U.S. Gulf Coast and in the Middle East, as well as sustaining, debottlenecking and optimization projects on existing assets.64Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsRefiningCapital spending for the Refining segment during the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, was $2.5 billion, primarily for refinery upgrade projects to enhance the yield of high-value products, renewable fuels projects, improvements to the operating integrity of key processing units, and safety-related projects. Key projects funded during the three-year period included:•Installation of facilities to improve clean product yield at the Ponca City and Sweeny refineries, as well as the jointly owned Wood River Refinery.•Installation of facilities to improve product value at the Lake Charles Refinery.•Installation of facilities to produce renewable fuels at our San Francisco and Humber refineries.Marketing and SpecialtiesCapital spending for the M&S segment during the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, was primarily for investment in retail marketing joint ventures in the U.S. West Coast and Central regions; the continued acquisition, development and enhancement of retail sites in Europe; and acquisition of a commercial fleet fueling business in California, which will provide further placement opportunities for renewable diesel production to end-use customers.Corporate and OtherCapital spending for Corporate and Other during the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, was primarily for information technology and facilities.2023 BudgetOur 2023 capital budget is $2 billion, including $865 million for sustaining capital and $1.1 billion for growth capital. Approximately 50% of growth capital is expected to support lower-carbon opportunities. Our projected $2 billion capital budget excludes our portion of planned capital spending by our major joint ventures CPChem and WRB totaling $1.1 billion.The Midstream capital budget of $639 million includes a growth capital budget of $310 million which will be directed toward enhancing our integrated NGL value chain from wellhead to market. The Midstream capital budget also includes $329 million for sustaining projects. The Midstream expected spend includes 100% of DCP LP’s sustaining capital of $150 million and $125 million of growth capital. In Refining, the total capital budget of $1.1 billion consists of $389 million for reliability, safety and environmental projects and $729 million for growth capital. Refining’s growth capital includes the continued conversion of the San Francisco Refinery into a renewable fuels facility. The M&S capital budget of $134 million reflects the continued development and enhancement of our retail network, including energy transition opportunities. The Corporate and Other capital budget is $108 million primarily for digital transformation and information technology projects.65Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsContingenciesA number of lawsuits involving a variety of claims that arose in the ordinary course of business have been filed against us or are subject to indemnifications provided by us. We also may be required to remove or mitigate the effects on the environment of the placement, storage, disposal or release of certain chemical, mineral and petroleum substances at various active and inactive sites. We regularly assess the need for financial recognition or disclosure of these contingencies. In the case of all known contingencies (other than those related to income taxes), we accrue a liability when the loss is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable. If a range of amounts can be reasonably estimated and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount, then the minimum of the range is accrued. We do not reduce these liabilities for potential insurance or third-party recoveries. If applicable, we accrue receivables for probable insurance or other third-party recoveries. In the case of income tax-related contingencies, we use a cumulative probability-weighted loss accrual in cases where sustaining a tax position is uncertain.Based on currently available information, we believe it is remote that future costs related to known contingent liability exposures will exceed current accruals by an amount that would have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements. As we learn new facts concerning contingencies, we reassess our position both with respect to accrued liabilities and other potential exposures. Estimates particularly sensitive to future changes include contingent liabilities recorded for environmental remediation, tax and legal matters. Estimated future environmental remediation costs are subject to change due to such factors as the uncertain magnitude of cleanup costs, the unknown time and extent of such remedial actions that may be required, and the determination of our liability in proportion to that of other potentially responsible parties. Estimated future costs related to tax and legal matters are subject to change as events evolve and as additional information becomes available during the administrative and litigation processes.Legal and Tax MattersOur legal and tax matters are handled by our legal and tax organizations. These organizations apply their knowledge, experience and professional judgment to the specific characteristics of our cases and uncertain tax positions. We employ a litigation management process to manage and monitor the legal proceedings. Our process facilitates the early evaluation and quantification of potential exposures in individual cases and enables the tracking of those cases that have been scheduled for trial and/or mediation. Based on professional judgment and experience in using these litigation management tools and available information about current developments in all our cases, our legal organization regularly assesses the adequacy of current accruals and determines if adjustment of existing accruals, or establishment of new accruals, is required. In the case of income tax-related contingencies, we monitor tax legislation and court decisions, the status of tax audits and the statute of limitations within which a taxing authority can assert a liability. See Note 23—Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information about income tax-related contingencies.66Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsEnvironmentalWe are subject to numerous international, federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. Among the most significant of these international and federal environmental laws and regulations are the:•U.S. Federal Clean Air Act, which governs air emissions.•U.S. Federal Clean Water Act, which governs discharges into bodies of water.•European Union Regulation for Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (EU REACH), which governs production, marketing and use of chemicals and the United Kingdom’s legislation for the Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (UK REACH), which replaced EU REACH in the United Kingdom in 2021 following the United Kingdom’s exit from the European Union (BREXIT). •U.S. Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), which imposes liability on generators, transporters and arrangers of hazardous substances at sites where hazardous substance releases have occurred or are threatening to occur.•U.S. Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), which governs the treatment, storage and disposal of solid waste.•U.S. Federal Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA), which requires facilities to report toxic chemical inventories to local emergency planning committees and response departments.•U.S. Federal Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA90), under which owners and operators of onshore facilities and pipelines as well as owners and operators of vessels are liable for removal costs and damages that result from a discharge of crude oil into navigable waters of the United States.•European Union Trading Directive resulting in the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS), which uses a market-based mechanism to incentivize the reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, as well as the United Kingdom Emissions Trading Scheme (UK ETS), which replaced the EU ETS in the United Kingdom in 2021, following BREXIT. These laws and their implementing regulations set limits on emissions and, in the case of discharges to water, establish water quality limits. They also, in most cases, require permits in association with new or modified operations. These permits can require an applicant to collect substantial information in connection with the application process, which can be expensive and time consuming. In addition, there can be delays associated with notice and comment periods and the agency’s processing of the application. Many of the delays associated with the permitting process are beyond the control of the applicant.Other foreign countries and many states where we operate also have, or are developing, similar environmental laws and regulations governing these same types of activities. While similar, in some cases these regulations may impose additional, or more stringent, requirements that can add to the cost and difficulty of developing infrastructure and marketing and transporting products across state and international borders. For example, in California the South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD) approved amendments to the Regional Clean Air Incentives Market (RECLAIM) that became effective in 2016, which require a phased reduction of nitrogen oxide emissions through 2022, affecting refineries in the Los Angeles metropolitan area. In 2017, SCAQMD required additional nitrogen oxide emissions reductions through 2025 and, on November 5, 2021, promulgated new regulations to replace the RECLAIM program with a traditional command and control regulatory regime.The ultimate financial impact arising from environmental laws and regulations is neither clearly known nor easily determinable as new standards, such as air emission standards, water quality standards and stricter fuel regulations, continue to evolve. However, environmental laws and regulations, including those that may arise to address concerns about global climate change, are expected to continue to have an increasing impact on our operations in the United States and in other countries in which we operate. Notable areas of potential impacts include air emissions compliance and remediation obligations in the United States.67Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsAn example of this in the fuels area is the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA). It requires fuel producers and importers to provide additional renewable fuels for transportation motor fuels and stipulates a mix of various types. RINs form the mechanism used by the EPA to record compliance with the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS). If an obligated party has more RINs than it needs to meet its obligation, it may sell or trade the extra RINs, or instead choose to “bank” them for use the following year. We have met the requirements to date while establishing implementation, operating and capital strategies, along with advanced technology development, to address projected future renewable volume obligation (RVO) requirements. On December 1, 2022, the EPA proposed RVO for the 2023, 2024 and 2025 compliance years, as well as RIN generation from renewable electricity utilized as a transportation fuel (eRINs). These standards increase cellulosic volumes, which reflect the EPA’s forecast for increasing eRIN volumes beginning in 2024. They also increase total advanced biofuel volumes, which reflect the EPA’s forecast for increasing eRIN volumes beginning in 2024. In addition, they increase total advanced biofuel volumes from the 5.63 billion gallons established for the 2022 compliance year to 7.43 billion gallons in 2025. If adopted, we may experience a decrease in demand for refined petroleum products and increased program costs if not fully recovered in the market. This program continues to be the subject of possible Congressional review and re-promulgation in revised form, and the EPA’s final regulations establishing RVO requirements have been and continue to be subject to legal challenge, further creating uncertainty regarding RVO requirements.We are required to purchase RINs in the open market to satisfy the portion of our obligation under the RFS that is not fulfilled by blending renewable fuels into the motor fuels we produce. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, we incurred expenses of $478 million, $441 million and $342 million, respectively, associated with our obligation to purchase RINs in the open market to comply with the RFS for our wholly owned refineries. These expenses are included in the “Purchased crude oil and products” line item on our consolidated statement of operations. Our jointly owned refineries also incurred expenses associated with the purchase of RINs in the open market, of which our share was $437 million, $351 million and $133 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. These expenses are included in the “Equity in earnings of affiliates” line item on our consolidated statement of operations. The amount of these expenses and fluctuations between periods is primarily driven by the market price of RINs, refinery production, blending activities, and RVO requirements.We also are subject to certain laws and regulations relating to environmental remediation obligations associated with current and past operations. Such laws and regulations include CERCLA and RCRA and their state equivalents. Remediation obligations include cleanup responsibility arising from petroleum releases from underground storage tanks located at numerous previously and currently owned and/or operated petroleum-marketing outlets throughout the United States. Federal and state laws require contamination caused by such underground storage tank releases be assessed and remediated to meet applicable standards. In addition to other cleanup standards, many states have adopted cleanup criteria for methyl tertiary-butyl ether (MTBE) for both soil and groundwater and both the EPA and many states may adopt cleanup standards for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), which may have been a constituent in certain firefighting foams used or stored at or near some of our facilities.At RCRA-permitted facilities, we are required to assess environmental conditions. If conditions warrant, we may be required to remediate contamination caused by prior operations. In contrast to CERCLA, which is often referred to as “Superfund,” the cost of corrective action activities under RCRA corrective action programs typically is borne solely by us. We anticipate increased expenditures for RCRA remediation activities may be required, but such annual expenditures for the near term are not expected to vary significantly from the range of such expenditures we have experienced over the past few years. Longer-term expenditures are subject to considerable uncertainty and may fluctuate significantly.We occasionally receive requests for information or notices of potential liability from the EPA and state environmental agencies alleging that we are a potentially responsible party under CERCLA or an equivalent state statute. On occasion, we also have been made a party to cost recovery litigation by those agencies or by private parties. These requests, notices and lawsuits assert potential liability for remediation costs at various sites that typically are not owned by us, but allegedly contain wastes attributable to our past operations. As of December 31, 2021, we reported that we had been notified of potential liability under CERCLA and comparable state laws at 25 sites within the United States. In 2022, we were notified of one potentially new site through a CERCLA Section 104(e) information request issued by the EPA, and four sites that were deemed resolved and closed, accordingly, leaving 22 unresolved sites with potential liability at December 31, 2022.68Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsFor the majority of Superfund sites, our potential liability will be less than the total site remediation costs because the percentage of waste attributable to us, versus that attributable to all other potentially responsible parties, is relatively low. Although liability of those potentially responsible is generally joint and several for federal sites and frequently so for state sites, other potentially responsible parties at sites where we are a party typically have had the financial strength to meet their obligations, and where they have not, or where potentially responsible parties could not be located, our share of liability has not increased materially. Many of the sites for which we are potentially responsible are still under investigation by the EPA or the state agencies concerned. Prior to actual cleanup, those potentially responsible normally assess site conditions, apportion responsibility and determine the appropriate remediation. In some instances, we may have no liability or attain a settlement of liability. Actual cleanup costs generally occur after the parties obtain the EPA or equivalent state agency approval of a remediation plan. There are relatively few sites where we are a major participant, and given the timing and amounts of anticipated expenditures, neither the cost of remediation at those sites nor such costs at all CERCLA sites, in the aggregate, is expected to have a material adverse effect on our competitive or financial condition.We incur costs related to the prevention, control, abatement or elimination of environmental pollution. Expensed environmental costs were $728 million in 2022 and are expected to be approximately $800 million in 2023 and 2024. Capitalized environmental costs were $88 million in 2022 and are expected to be approximately $140 million and $250 million, in 2023 and 2024, respectively. These amounts do not include capital expenditures made for other purposes that have an indirect benefit on environmental compliance. Accrued liabilities for remediation activities are not reduced for potential recoveries from insurers or other third parties and are not discounted (except those assumed in a business combination, which we record on a discounted basis).Many of these liabilities result from CERCLA, RCRA and similar state laws that require us to undertake certain investigative and remedial activities at sites where we conduct, or once conducted, operations or at sites where our generated waste was disposed. We also have accrued for a number of sites we identified that may require environmental remediation, but which are not currently the subject of CERCLA, RCRA or state enforcement activities. If applicable, we accrue receivables for probable insurance or other third-party recoveries. In the future, we may incur significant costs under both CERCLA and RCRA. Remediation activities vary substantially in duration and cost from site to site, depending on the mix of unique site characteristics, evolving remediation technologies, diverse regulatory agencies and enforcement policies, and the presence or absence of potentially liable third parties. Therefore, it is difficult to develop reasonable estimates of future site remediation costs.Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, and as with other companies engaged in similar businesses, environmental costs and liabilities are inherent concerns in certain of our operations and products, and there can be no assurance that those costs and liabilities will not be material. However, we currently do not expect any material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position as a result of compliance with current environmental laws and regulations.Climate ChangeThere has been a broad range of proposed or promulgated state, national and international laws focusing on GHG emissions reduction, including various regulations proposed or issued by the EPA. These proposed or promulgated laws apply or could apply in states and/or countries where we have interests or may have interests in the future. Laws regulating GHG emissions continue to evolve, and while it is not possible to accurately estimate either a timetable for implementation or our future compliance costs relating to implementation, such laws potentially could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition as a result of increasing costs of compliance, lengthening project implementation and agency reviews, or reducing demand for certain hydrocarbon products. Examples of legislation or precursors for possible regulation that do or could affect our operations include: •EU ETS, which is part of the European Union’s policy to combat climate change and is a key tool for reducing industrial GHG emissions. EU ETS impacts factories, power stations and other installations across all EU member states. As a result of the United Kingdom’s exit from the EU (BREXIT), those types of entities in the United Kingdom are now subject to the UK ETS, rather than the EU ETS.•EU Renewable Energy Directive II, which increases the EU’s energy consumption from renewable sources in the electricity, heat, and transportation sectors to 32% by 2030. 69Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements•United Kingdom’s Renewable Fuel Obligation, which is intended to reduce the GHG emissions from fuel used in the United Kingdom transportation sector by encouraging the supply of renewable fuels. •California’s Senate Bill No. 32, which requires reduction of California's GHG emissions to 40% below the 1990 emission level by 2030, and Assembly Bill 398, which extends the California GHG emission cap and trade program through 2030. Other GHG emissions programs in the western U.S. states have been enacted or are under consideration or development, including amendments to California's Low Carbon Fuel Standard, California’s Advanced Clean Cars and Trucks Programs, California’s Carbon Neutrality by 2045 Scoping Plan, Oregon's Low Carbon Fuel Standard and Climate Protection Plan, and Washington's carbon reduction programs.•United States’ Inflation Reduction Act, which contains tax inducements and other provisions that incentivize investment, development, and deployment of alternative energy sources and technologies, which is intended to accelerate the energy transition.•The U.S. Supreme Court decision in Massachusetts v. EPA, 549 U.S. 497, 127 S. Ct. 1438 (2007), confirming that the EPA has the authority to regulate carbon dioxide as an “air pollutant” under the Federal Clean Air Act.•The EPA’s announcement on March 29, 2010 (published as “Interpretation of Regulations that Determine Pollutants Covered by Clean Air Act Permitting Programs,” 75 Fed. Reg. 17004 (April 2, 2010)), and the EPA’s and U.S. Department of Transportation’s joint promulgation of a Final Rule on April 1, 2010, that triggers regulation of GHGs under the Clean Air Act. These collectively may lead to more climate-based claims for damages, and may result in longer agency review time for development projects to determine the extent of potential climate change. •The EPA's 2015 Final Rule regulating GHG emissions from existing fossil fuel-fired electrical generating units under the Federal Clean Air Act, commonly referred to as the Clean Power Plan. The EPA commenced rulemaking in 2017 to rescind the Clean Power Plan and, in August 2018, the EPA proposed the Affordable Clean Energy (ACE) rule as its replacement. On January 19, 2021, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia invalidated the ACE rule and remanded the matter to the EPA, essentially restarting this rulemaking process. •Carbon taxes in certain jurisdictions.•GHG emission cap and trade programs in certain jurisdictions.In the EU, the first phase of the EU ETS completed at the end of 2007. Phase II was undertaken from 2008 through 2012, and Phase III ran from 2013 through to 2020. Phase IV runs from January 1, 2021 through 2030 and sectors covered under the ETS must reduce their GHG emissions by 43% compared to 2005 levels and there is agreement between the EU Member States, the European Parliament, and the EU Commission (which is pending ratification by the EU Council and European Parliament) to increase the Phase IV GHG emissions reduction to 63% by 2030 compared to 2005 levels. The United Kingdom is no longer part of the EU ETS and, instead, has been under the UK ETS since 2021. Phillips 66 has assets that are subject to the EU ETS and assets that are subject to the UK ETS.From November 30 to December 12, 2015, more than 190 countries, including the United States, participated in the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris, France. The conference culminated in what is known as the “Paris Agreement,” which, upon certain conditions being met, entered into force on November 4, 2016. The Paris Agreement establishes a commitment by signatory parties to pursue domestic GHG emission reductions. In 2017, President Trump announced his intention to withdraw the United States from the Paris Agreement and that withdrawal became effective on November 4, 2020. On January 20, 2021, President Biden signed the “Acceptance on Behalf of the United States of America,” which allows the United States to rejoin the Paris Agreement. The United States officially rejoined the Paris Agreement in February 2021, which could lead to additional GHG emission reduction requirements for sources in the United States.In the United States, some additional form of regulation is likely to be forthcoming at the state or federal levels with respect to GHG emissions. Such regulation could take any of several forms that may result in additional financial burden in the form of taxes, the restriction of output, investments of capital to maintain compliance with laws and regulations, or required acquisition or trading of emission allowances. 70Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsCompliance with changes in laws and regulations that create a GHG emission trading program, GHG reduction requirements or carbon taxes could significantly increase our costs, reduce demand for fossil energy derived products, impact the cost and availability of capital and increase our exposure to litigation. Such laws and regulations could also increase demand for less carbon intensive energy sources. An example of one such program is California’s cap and trade program, which was promulgated pursuant to the State’s Global Warming Solutions Act. The program had been limited to certain stationary sources, which include our refineries in California, but beginning in January 2015 was expanded to include emissions from transportation fuels distributed in California. Inclusion of transportation fuels in California’s cap and trade program as currently promulgated has increased our cap and trade program compliance costs. The ultimate impact on our financial performance, either positive or negative, from this and similar programs, will depend on a number of factors, including, but not limited to:•Whether and to what extent legislation or regulation is enacted.•The nature of the legislation or regulation, such as a cap and trade system or a tax on emissions.•The GHG reductions required.•The price and availability of offsets.•The demand for, and amount and allocation of allowances.•Technological and scientific developments leading to new products or services.•Any potential significant physical effects of climate change, such as increased severe weather events, changes in sea levels and changes in temperature.•Whether, and the extent to which, increased compliance costs are ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services.We consider and take into account anticipated future GHG emissions in designing and developing major facilities and projects, and implement energy efficiency initiatives to reduce GHG emissions. Data on our GHG emissions, legal requirements regulating such emissions, and the possible physical effects of climate change on our coastal assets are incorporated into our planning, investment, and risk management decision-making. We are working to continuously improve operational and energy efficiency through resource and energy conservation throughout our operations.In February 2022, we announced our intention to reduce our Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions intensity related to our operations by 50% of 2019 levels by the year 2050. This new target builds upon our previously announced 2030 GHG emissions intensity targets to reduce Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions from our operations by 30% and Scope 3 emissions from our energy products by 15% compared to 2019 levels.In addition to the disclosures above, we have issued our 2022 Sustainability Report that is accessible on our website and provides more detailed information on our Environmental, Social and Corporate Governance initiatives, including detailed information on environmental metrics.71Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATESThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to select appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. See Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for descriptions of our major accounting policies. Some of these accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent that there is a reasonable likelihood that materially different amounts would have been reported under different conditions, or if different assumptions had been used. The following discussion of critical accounting estimates addresses accounting areas where the nature of accounting estimates or assumptions could be material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change.Business CombinationIn accounting for a business combination, assets acquired, liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interests are recorded based on estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition. The excess or shortfall of the purchase price when compared to the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired, if any, is recorded as goodwill or a bargain purchase gain, respectively. A significant amount of judgment is made in estimating the individual fair value of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, noncontrolling interests and other assets and liabilities. We use available information to make these fair value determinations and engage third-party specialists in the valuation process as necessary.The fair values of assets acquired, liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interests as of the acquisition date are often estimated using a combination of approaches, including the income approach, which requires us to project future cash flows and apply an appropriate discount rate; the cost approach, which requires estimates of replacement costs and depreciation and obsolescence estimates; and the market approach which uses market data and adjusts for entity specific differences. The estimates used in determining fair values are based on assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain. Accordingly, actual results may differ materially from the estimated results used to determine fair value.See Note 4—Business Combination, and Note 18—Fair Value Measurements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information on the merger of DCP Midstream and Gray Oak Holdings and fair value measurements.Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Equity Method InvestmentsLong-lived assets used in operations are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate a possible significant deterioration in future expected cash flows. If the sum of the undiscounted expected future before-tax cash flows of an asset group is less than the carrying value, including applicable liabilities, the carrying value is written down to estimated fair value. Individual assets are grouped for impairment purposes based on a judgmental assessment of the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets. Because there usually is a lack of quoted market prices for long-lived assets, the fair value of impaired assets is typically determined using one or more of the following methods: the present value of expected future cash flows using discount rates and other assumptions believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants; a market multiple for similar assets; historical market transactions including similar assets, adjusted using principal market participant assumptions when necessary; or replacement cost adjusted for physical deterioration and economic obsolescence. The expected future cash flows used for impairment reviews and related fair value calculations are based on judgmental assessments, including future volumes, commodity prices, operating costs, margins, discount rates and capital project decisions, considering all available information at the date of review.72Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsInvestments in nonconsolidated entities accounted for under the equity method are assessed for impairment when there are indicators of a loss in value, such as a lack of sustained earnings capacity or a current fair value less than the investment’s carrying amount. When it is determined that an indicated impairment is other than temporary, a charge is recognized for the difference between the investment’s carrying value and its estimated fair value. When determining whether a decline in value is other than temporary, management considers factors such as the duration and extent of the decline, the investee’s financial condition and near-term prospects, and our ability and intention to retain our investment for a period that allows for recovery. When quoted market prices are not available, the fair value is usually based on the present value of expected future cash flows using discount rates and other assumptions believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants and observed market earnings multiples of comparable companies, if appropriate. Different assumptions could affect the timing and the amount of an impairment of an investment in any period.See Note 11—Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for information about impairments recorded in 2022, 2021 and 2020.73Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsGUARANTOR FINANCIAL INFORMATIONWe have various cross guarantees between Phillips 66 and its wholly owned subsidiary Phillips 66 Company (together, the Obligor Group) with respect to publicly held debt securities. Phillips 66 conducts substantially all of its operations through subsidiaries, including Phillips 66 Company, and those subsidiaries generate substantially all of its operating income and cash flow. Phillips 66 has fully and unconditionally guaranteed the payment obligations of Phillips 66 Company with respect to its publicly held debt securities. In addition, Phillips 66 Company has fully and unconditionally guaranteed the payment obligations of Phillips 66 with respect to its publicly held debt securities. All guarantees are full and unconditional. At December 31, 2022, $12 billion of senior unsecured notes outstanding has been guaranteed by the Obligor Group.See the “Significant Sources of Capital” section for additional information regarding the Exchange Offers by Phillips 66 Company for existing senior notes of Phillips 66 Partners that settled in May 2022.Summarized financial information of the Obligor Group is presented on a combined basis. Intercompany transactions among the members of the Obligor Group have been eliminated.

The realized refining margins are adjusted to include our proportional share of our joint venture refineries’ realized margins, as well as to exclude those items that are not representative of the underlying operating performance of a period, which we call “special items.” The realized refining margins are converted to a per-barrel basis by dividing them by total refinery processed inputs (primarily crude oil) measured on a barrel basis, including our share of inputs processed by our joint venture refineries. Our realized refining margin per barrel is intended to be comparable with industry refining margins, which are known as “crack spreads.” As discussed in “Executive Overview and Business Environment—Business Environment,” industry crack spreads measure the difference between market prices for refined petroleum products and crude oil. We believe realized refining margin per barrel calculated on a similar basis as industry crack spreads provides a useful measure of how well we performed relative to benchmark industry refining margins.The GAAP performance measure most directly comparable to realized refining margin per barrel is the Refining segment’s “income (loss) before income taxes per barrel.” Realized refining margin per barrel excludes items that are typically included in a manufacturer’s gross margin, such as depreciation and operating expenses, and other items used to determine income (loss) before income taxes, such as general and administrative expenses. It also includes our proportional share of joint venture refineries’ realized refining margins and excludes special items. Because realized refining margin per barrel is calculated in this manner, and because realized refining margin per barrel may be defined differently by other companies in our industry, it has limitations as an analytical tool.

We and certain of our subsidiaries may hold and use derivative contracts to manage these risks.As a result of the merger, we included the assets and liabilities of DCP Midstream, LLC’s Class A Segment (DCP Midstream Class A Segment), DCP Sand Hills Pipeline, LLC and DCP Southern Hills Pipeline, LLC in our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2022, and the results of their operations and cash flows are reported in our consolidated statements of operations and cash flows from August 18, 2022 through December 31, 2022.DCP Midstream Class A Segment’s market risks are solely attributable to market risks of DCP Midstream, LP (DCP LP), because DCP LP is the sole operational asset in DCP Midstream Class A Segment.DCP LP is exposed to market risks, including changes in commodity prices and interest rates. DCP LP uses financial instruments such as forward contracts, swaps and futures to mitigate the effects of these risks. See Note 3—DCP Midstream, LLC and Gray Oak Holdings LLC Merger, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information on the structure of the merger.Commodity Price RiskGenerally, our policy is to remain exposed to the market prices of commodities. Consistent with this policy, we use derivative contracts to convert our exposure from fixed-price sales or purchase contracts, often specified in contracts with refined petroleum product customers, back to floating market prices. We also use futures, forwards, swaps and options in various markets to accomplish the following objectives:•Balance physical systems or meet our refinery requirements and market demand. In addition to cash settlement prior to contract expiration, certain exchange-traded futures may be settled by physical delivery of the underlying commodity.•Enable us to use the market knowledge gained from our physical commodity market activities to capture market opportunities, such as moving physical commodities to more profitable locations, storing commodities to capture seasonal or time premiums, and blending commodities to capture quality upgrades. Derivatives may be utilized to optimize these activities. •Manage the risk to our cash flows from price exposures on specific crude oil, refined petroleum product, NGL, renewable feedstock and natural gas transactions.These objectives optimize the value of our supply chain and may reduce our exposure to fluctuations in market prices.Phillips 66’s use of derivative instruments is governed by an “Authority Limitations” document approved by our Board of Directors. This document prohibits the use of highly leveraged derivatives or derivative instruments without sufficient market liquidity for comparable valuations, and establishes Value at Risk (VaR) limits. Compliance with these limits is monitored daily by our global risk group. 80Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsPhillips 66 uses a VaR model to estimate the loss in fair value that could potentially result on a single day from the effect of adverse changes in market conditions on the derivative commodity instruments held or issued. Using Monte Carlo simulation, a 95% confidence level and a one-day holding period, the VaR for derivative commodity instruments issued or held at December 31, 2022 and 2021, was immaterial to our cash flows and results of operations.DCP LP’s use of derivative instruments is governed by a comprehensive risk management policy and a risk management committee that monitors and manages market risks associated with commodity prices. The risk management committee is composed of DCP LP’s senior executives who receive regular briefings on positions and exposures, credit exposures and overall risk management in the context of market activities. The risk management committee is responsible for the overall management of commodity price and credit risks, including monitoring exposure limits. The estimated loss in fair value that could potentially result on a single day from the effect of adverse changes in market conditions on derivative commodity instruments held or issued is not expected to be material to our cash flows and results of operations.Interest Rate RiskOur use of fixed- or variable-rate debt directly exposes us to interest rate risk. Fixed-rate debt, such as our senior notes, exposes us to changes in the fair value of our debt due to changes in market interest rates. Fixed-rate debt also exposes us to the risk that we may need to refinance maturing debt with new debt at higher rates, or that we may be obligated to pay rates higher than the current market. Variable-rate debt, such as our floating-rate notes or borrowings under our revolving credit facility, exposes us to short-term changes in market rates that impact our interest expense. The following tables provide information about our debt instruments that are sensitive to changes in U.S. interest rates. These tables present principal cash flows and related weighted-average interest rates by expected maturity dates. Weighted-average variable rates are based on effective rates at each reporting date. The carrying amount of our floating-rate debt approximates its fair value. The fair value of the fixed-rate financial instruments is estimated based on observable market prices.Millions of Dollars, Except as IndicatedExpected Maturity DateFixed Rate MaturityAverage Interest RateFloating Rate MaturityAverage Interest RateYear-End 20222023$500 3.88 %$— — %20241,100 1.32 40 5.33 20251,975 4.43 — — 2026992 2.42 — — 2027500 5.63 — — Remaining years12,040 4.67 25 4.72 Total$17,107 $65 Fair value$15,871 $65 Millions of Dollars, Except as IndicatedExpected Maturity DateFixed Rate MaturityAverage Interest RateFloating Rate MaturityAverage Interest RateYear-End 20212022$1,000 4.30 %$450 0.98 %2023500 3.70 — — 20241,100 1.32 — — 20251,150 3.74 — — 20261,000 2.43 — — Remaining years9,026 4.31 25 0.70 Total$13,776 $475 Fair value$15,353 $475 81Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsForeign Currency RiskWe are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations related to our international operations. Generally, we do not hedge our foreign currency risk.Phillips 66’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer monitor risks effecting its operations resulting from commodity prices, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. In addition, DCP LP’s risk management committee monitors risks effecting its operations resulting from commodity prices and interest rates.

You can normally identify our forward-looking statements by the words “anticipate,” “estimate,” “believe,” “budget,” “continue,” “could,” “intend,” “may,” “plan,” “potential,” “predict,” “seek,” “should,” “will,” “would,” “expect,” “objective,” “projection,” “forecast,” “goal,” “guidance,” “outlook,” “effort,” “target” and similar expressions that convey the prospective nature of events or outcomes, but the absence of such words does not mean a statement is not forward-looking.We based the forward-looking statements on our current expectations, estimates and projections about us, our operations, our joint ventures and entities in which we have equity interests, as well as the industries in which we and they operate. We caution you not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements as they are not guarantees of future performance and involve assumptions that, while made in good faith, may prove to be incorrect, and involve risks and uncertainties we cannot predict. In addition, we based many of these forward-looking statements on assumptions about future events that may prove to be inaccurate. Accordingly, our actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what we have expressed or forecast in any forward-looking statements. Such differences could result from a variety of factors, including:•Fluctuations in NGL, crude oil, refined petroleum product and natural gas prices and refining, marketing and petrochemical margins.•Changes in governmental policies relating to NGL, crude oil, natural gas or refined petroleum products pricing, regulation or taxation, including exports.•Capacity constraints in, or other limitations on, the pipelines, storage and fractionation facilities to which we deliver natural gas or NGL and the availability of alternative markets and arrangements for our natural gas and NGL.•Actions taken by OPEC and non-OPEC oil producing countries impacting supply and demand and correspondingly, commodity prices.•The ability to achieve the expected benefits of the integration of DCP LP and any other benefits that may result from the buy-in of DCP’s publicly-held common units, if consummated.•Unexpected changes in costs or technical requirements for constructing, modifying or operating our facilities or transporting our products.•Unexpected technological or commercial difficulties in manufacturing, refining or transporting our products, including chemical products.•Lack of, or disruptions in, adequate and reliable transportation for our NGL, crude oil, natural gas and refined petroleum products.•The level and success of drilling and quality of production volumes around our midstream assets.•The inability to timely obtain or maintain permits, including those necessary for capital projects.•The inability to comply with government regulations or make capital expenditures required to maintain compliance.•Changes to worldwide government policies relating to renewable fuels, climate change and greenhouse gas emissions that adversely affect programs like the renewable fuel standards program, low carbon fuel standards and tax credits for biofuels.•General domestic and international economic and political developments including armed hostilities, including the Russia-Ukraine war, expropriation of assets, and other political, economic or diplomatic developments, including those caused by public health issues, outbreaks of diseases and pandemics.•The impact on commercial activity and demand for refined petroleum products from any widespread public health crisis, as well as the extent and duration of recovery of economies and demand for our products following any such crisis. 83Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements•Failure to complete definitive agreements and feasibility studies for, and to complete construction of, announced and future capital projects on time and within budget.•Potential disruption or interruption of our operations or damage to our facilities due to accidents, weather and climate events, civil unrest, insurrections, political events, terrorism or cyberattacks.•The inability to meet our sustainability goals, including reducing our GHG emissions intensity, developing and protecting new technologies, and commercializing lower-carbon opportunities.•Failure of new products and services to achieve market acceptance.•International monetary conditions and exchange controls.•Substantial investments required, or reduced demand for products, as a result of existing or future environmental rules and regulations, including GHG emissions reductions and reduced consumer demand for refined petroleum products.•Liability resulting from litigation or for remedial actions, including removal and reclamation obligations under environmental regulations.•Changes in tax, environmental and other laws and regulations (including alternative energy mandates) applicable to our business.•Political and societal concerns about climate change that could result in changes to our business or operations or increase expenditures, including litigation-related expenses.•Changes in estimates or projections used to assess fair value of intangible assets, goodwill and property and equipment and/or strategic decisions or other developments with respect to our asset portfolio that cause impairment charges.•Limited access to capital or significantly higher cost of capital related to changes to our credit profile or illiquidity or uncertainty in the domestic or international financial markets.•The creditworthiness of our customers and the counterparties to our transactions, including the impact of bankruptcies.•The operation, financing and distribution decisions of our joint ventures that we do not control.•The factors generally described in “Item 1A.
