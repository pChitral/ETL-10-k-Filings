1156375,CME,CME GROUP INC.,2012,"ITEM 7.MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSINTRODUCTIONManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is organized as follows:•Overview: Includes a discussion of our business structure; current economic and industry-wide trends relevant to our business; our current business strategy; and our primary sources of operating and non-operating revenues and expenses.•Critical Accounting Policies: Provides an explanation of accounting policies which may have a significant impact on our financial results and the estimates, assumptions and risks associated with those policies.•Recent Accounting Pronouncements: Includes an evaluation of recent accounting pronouncements and the potential impact of their future adoption on our financial results.•Results of Operations: Includes a discussion of our 2011, 2010 and 2009 financial results and any known events or trends which are likely to impact future results.•Liquidity and Capital Resources: Includes a discussion of our future cash requirements, capital resources, significant planned expenditures and financing arrangements.On March 18, 2010, Board of Trade of the City of Chicago, Inc. (CBOT) acquired a 90% ownership interest in CME Group Index Services LLC (Index Services), a joint venture with Dow Jones & Company (Dow Jones). The following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations includes the financial results of Index Services beginning March 19, 2010. References in this discussion and analysis to “we” and “our” are to CME Group Inc. (CME Group) and its consolidated subsidiaries, collectively. References to “exchange” are to Chicago Mercantile Exchange Inc. (CME), CBOT and New York Mercantile Exchange, Inc. (NYMEX), collectively. OVERVIEWBusiness StructureCME Group, a Delaware stock corporation, is the holding company for CME, CBOT, NYMEX and their respective subsidiaries. The holding company structure is designed to provide strategic and operational flexibility. CME Group also includes two clearing houses - CME Clearing, a division of CME, and CME Clearing Europe Limited (CMECE). CME Group's Class A common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market (NASDAQ) under the ticker symbol “CME.” Our exchange consists of designated contract markets for the trading of futures and options on futures contracts. We also clear futures, options on futures and over-the-counter contracts. Futures contracts and options on futures contracts provide investors with vehicles for protecting against, and potentially profiting from, price changes in financial instruments and physical commodities. We are a global exchange with customer access available virtually all over the world. Our customers consist of professional traders, financial institutions, individual and institutional investors, major corporations, manufacturers, producers and governments. Customers include both members of the exchange and non-members. We offer our customers the opportunity to trade futures contracts and options on futures contracts on a range of products including those based on interest rates, equities, foreign exchange, agricultural commodities, energy, and metals. We also clear over-the-counter contracts on a range of product lines including interest rate swaps, credit default swaps, energy and agricultural commodities. Our products provide a means for hedging, speculating and allocating assets. We identify new products by monitoring economic trends and their impact on the risk management and speculative needs of our existing and prospective customers. Our major product lines are traded through our electronic trading platform and our open outcry trading floors. These execution facilities offer our customers immediate trade execution and price transparency. In addition, trades can be executed through privately negotiated transactions that are cleared and settled through our CME clearing house. Our clearing houses clear, settle and guarantee every futures and options contract traded through our exchanges, in addition to cleared over-the-counter products, including credit default swaps and interest rate swaps. Our clearing house performance guarantee is an important function of our business. Because of this guarantee, our customers do not need to evaluate the credit of each potential counterparty or limit themselves to a selected set of counterparties. This flexibility increases the potential liquidity available for each trade. Additionally, the substitution of our clearing houses as the counterparty to every transaction allows our customers to establish a position with one party and then to offset the position with another party. This contract 33Table of Contentsoffsetting process provides our customers with flexibility in establishing and adjusting positions and provides for performance bond efficiencies. To ensure performance of counterparties, we establish and monitor financial requirements of our clearing firms. We also establish minimum performance bond requirements for our exchange-traded products and over-the-counter products. For CME and CMECE clearing firms, we mark-to-market all open positions at least twice a day and require payment from clearing firms whose positions have lost value and make payments to clearing firms whose positions have gained value. For select cleared-only markets, positions are marked-to-market daily, with the capability to mark-to-market more frequently as market conditions warrant. We maintain three separate financial safeguard packages for CME clearing firms: one for futures and options, one for cleared over-the-counter credit default swap contracts, and one for cleared over-the-counter interest rate swap contracts. In the unlikely event of a payment default by a clearing firm, we would first apply any assets of the defaulting clearing firm deposited with CME to satisfy its payment obligation. These assets include the defaulting firm's guaranty fund contributions, performance bonds and any other available assets, such as assets required for membership and any associated trading rights. In addition, we would make a demand for payment pursuant to any applicable guarantee provided to the exchange by the parent company of the clearing firm. Thereafter, if the payment default remains unsatisfied, we would use our surplus funds for futures and options contracts, or our designated working capital for cleared over-the-counter credit default swap contracts and cleared over-the-counter interest rate swap contracts. We would then use guaranty fund contributions of other clearing firms within the respective financial safeguard package and funds collected through an assessment against solvent clearing firms within the respective financial safeguard package to satisfy the deficit. Surplus funds represent the amount of CME working capital reduced by an amount necessary to support normal operations and amounts designated by CME for our credit default swap and interest rate swap financial safeguard packages. We maintain a separate financial safeguard package for CMECE clearing firms. In the unlikely event of a payment default by a CMECE clearing firm, we would first apply assets of the defaulting clearing firm to satisfy its payment obligation. These assets include the defaulting firm's performance bonds. Thereafter, if the payment default remains unsatisfied, we would use $60.0 million of CMECE funds. As of December 31, 2011, the guaranty fund contributions were contributed by CMECE. In 2012, the CMECE clearing firms may be asked to contribute to the CMECE guaranty fund and the size of the fund will be reviewed in light of the actual risk exposure. Once the CMECE clearing firms contribute to the guaranty fund, we would use at least $20.0 million of CMECE funds in the event of a default.Industry TrendsEconomic Environment. Our customers continue to use our markets as an effective and transparent means to manage risk and meet their investment needs despite recent economic uncertainty and volatility. In recent years, trading activity in our centralized markets has fluctuated due to the ongoing uncertainty in the financial markets caused by the United States and European credit crisis, fluctuations in the availability of credit, variations in the amount of assets under management as well as the Federal Reserve Bank’s continued zero interest rate policy. We continue to maintain high quality and diverse products as well as various clearing and market data services which support our customers in any economic environment. Competitive Environment. Our industry is highly competitive and we continue to encounter competition in all aspects of our business. We expect competition to continue to intensify, especially in light of recent regulatory reforms in the financial services industry. Competition is influenced by liquidity and transparency of the markets, variability in fee structures, breadth of product offerings including quality of new product development as well as efficient and innovative technology. We now face competition from other futures, securities and securities option exchanges; over-the-counter markets; clearing organizations; consortia formed by our members and large market participants; alternative trade execution facilities; technology firms, including market data distributors and electronic trading system developers, and others. As the market continues to evolve, we have worked to adapt our trading technology and clearing services to meet the needs of our customers. Regulatory Environment. Our operations as a derivatives exchange have historically been subject to extensive regulation. As a result of the widespread difficulties across the economy over recent years, the Dodd-Frank Act was signed into law in July 2010. The Dodd-Frank Act is a comprehensive banking and financial services reform package that includes significant changes to the oversight of the derivatives markets, both over-the-counter and exchange-traded. While we believe that the new regulations will provide opportunities for our business, the new regulations are subject to extensive rulemaking by various regulators. To the extent the regulatory environment following the implementation of the new legislation and other financial reform regulations is less beneficial for us or our customers, our business, financial condition and operating results could be negatively affected. We continue to actively participate in the rulemaking process with the goal that the final regulations serve the public interest, foster competition and innovation and do not place the U.S. financial services sector at a competitive disadvantage. The financial services industry in Europe is also undergoing similar regulatory reform, which could result in 34Table of Contentsadditional regulation over our European operations. Business StrategyOur strategy focuses on leveraging our benchmark products, enhancing our customer relations, expanding our customer base, advancing our clearing and trading technologies, and deriving benefits from our integrated clearing houses as well as our scalable infrastructure. We specifically focus our strategy on capitalizing on opportunities created by increased market awareness and acceptance of derivatives, increased price volatility, technological advances and the increasing need for counterparty risk mitigation and clearing services. This strategy allows us to continue to develop into a more broadly diversified financial exchange that provides trading and clearing solutions across a wide range of products and asset classes. We believe that we can build on our competitive strengths by implementing the following strategies:•Grow our core business by launching new products, expanding our existing benchmark product lines as well as improving our customer relations in order to cross-sell our products;•Globalize our business by expanding and diversifying our worldwide customer base through strategic investments and relationships with other key exchanges around the world, including Asia, Latin America and other emerging markets, which allows us to accelerate our market penetration and improve product sales channels;•Provide superior customer service, education and sales support to our customers by restructuring our global client development and sales organization to better target cross asset sales across customer segments, drive international sales and generate new client participation across all regions throughout the world;•Offer a comprehensive multi-asset class clearing solution to the over-the-counter market that maximizes operational efficiency, as well as expand our over-the-counter product offerings; and•Establish ourselves as the leading exchange company provider of information products and index services, which would allow us to create additional cross-listing opportunities and new opportunities for index creation. It will also allow us to create opportunities for licensing across the global market as well as expanding market data dissemination services to our global network of clients and exchange partners.Primary Sources of RevenueClearing and transaction fees. A majority of our revenue is derived from clearing and transaction fees, which include electronic trading fees, surcharges for privately-negotiated transactions and other volume-related charges for contracts executed through our trading venues. Because clearing and transaction fees are assessed on a per-contract basis, revenues and profitability fluctuate with changes in trading volume. In addition to the industry trends noted earlier, our trading volume and consequently our revenues tend to increase during periods of economic and geopolitical uncertainty as our customers seek to manage their exposure to, or speculate on, the market volatility resulting from uncertainty. While volume has the most significant impact on our clearing and transaction fees revenue, there are four other factors that also influence this source of revenues: •rate structure;•product mix;•venue, and•the percentage of trades executed by customers who are members compared with non-member customers.Rate structure. Customers benefit from volume discounts and limits on fees as part of our effort to increase liquidity in certain products. We offer various incentive programs to promote trading in various products and geographic locations. We may periodically change fees, volume discounts, limits on fees and member discounts, perhaps significantly, based on our review of operations and the business environment. Product mix. We offer trading of futures and options on futures contracts as well as cleared-only swap contracts on a wide-ranging set of products based on interest rates, equities, foreign exchange, agricultural commodities, energy and metals. Rates are varied by product in order to optimize revenue on existing products and to encourage trading volume upon introduction of new products. Venue. Our exchange is an international marketplace that brings together buyers and sellers mainly through our electronic trading platform as well as through open outcry trading on our trading floors, privately negotiated transactions and CME ClearPort. Any customer who is guaranteed by a clearing firm and who agrees to be bound by our exchange rules is able to obtain direct access to our electronic platform and CME ClearPort. Open outcry trading is conducted exclusively by our members, who may execute trades on behalf of customers or for themselves. 35Table of ContentsTypically, customers executing trades through our electronic platform are charged fees for using the platform in addition to the fees assessed on all transactions executed on our exchange. Customers entering into privately negotiated transactions also incur additional charges beyond the fees assessed on all transactions. Privately negotiated transactions include block trades, which are large transactions that are executed between selected parties off the public auction market on CME Globex or the trading floor. ClearPort provides for the clearing of OTC futures and options trades executed off-exchange. In addition to clearing fees, there are other assessments on ClearPort transactions. Member/non-member mix. Generally, member customers are charged lower fees than our non-member customers. Holding all other factors constant, revenue decreases if the percentage of trades executed by members increases, and increases if the percentage of non-member trades increases. Other sources. Revenue is also derived from other sources including market data and information services, access and communication fees and various services related to our exchange and building operations. Market data and information services. We receive market data and information services revenue from the dissemination of our market data to subscribers. Subscribers can obtain access to our market data services either directly or through third-party distributors. Our service offerings include access to real-time, delayed and end-of-day quotation, trade and summary market data for our products and other data sources. Users of our basic service receive real-time quotes and pay a flat monthly fee for each screen, or device, displaying our market data. Alternatively, customers can subscribe to market data provided on a limited group of products. The fee for this service is also a flat rate per month.Pricing for our market data services is based on the value of the service provided, our cost structure for the service and the price of comparable services offered by our competitors. Increases or decreases in our market data and information services revenue are influenced by changes in our price structure for existing market data offerings, introduction of new market data services and changes in the number of devices in use. General economic factors that affect the financial services industry, which constitutes our primary customer base, also influence revenue from our market data services. On March 18, 2010, CBOT and Dow Jones entered into an agreement to form Index Services. Index Services was formed through the contribution of CBOT's market data business and Dow Jones' index business. Index Services generates market data and information services revenue through licensing of its trademark indexes as well as through calculation and distribution of its market data. Access and communication fees. Access and communication fees are the connectivity charges to customers of the CME Globex platform to our market data vendors and to direct market data customers as well as charges to members and clearing firms that utilize our various telecommunications networks and communications services, including our co-location initiative, which was launched in January 2012. Access fee revenue varies depending on the type of connection provided to customers. Revenue from communication fees is dependent on open outcry trading, as a significant portion relates to telecommunications on our trading floors. Other revenues. Other revenues include rent charged to third party tenants as well as ancillary charges for utilities, parking and miscellaneous services provided to tenants. We maintain three commercial buildings in Chicago's central business district. We rent retail and office space to third party tenants, including exchange customers. We also maintain office space in New York City that is rented to third party tenants, including exchange customers. All tenants pay market rates for rent. Revenues related to our real estate operations are generally affected by market rental rates, lease renewals and business conditions in the financial services industry in which most of our tenants operate. In June 2011, we announced that we are pursuing a sale and partial leaseback of the north and south buildings of CBOT. If the sale is completed, other revenues from rent will decrease. To further diversify the range of services we offer, we have entered into processing and development agreements with other exchanges and service organizations. For example, in 2010, we entered into an agreement with BM&FBOVESPA S.A (BM&FBOVESPA) to develop a new multi-asset class electronic trading platform for their customers. We recognize revenue under this agreement as services are provided and when developed technology is delivered. Additionally, other revenues include fees for administrating our Interest Earning Facility (IEF) program, trade order routing, and various services to members and clearing firms. We offer clearing firms the opportunity to invest cash performance bonds in our various IEF offerings. These clearing firms receive interest income, and we receive a fee based on total funds on deposit. In addition, other revenues include trading gains and losses generated by GFX Corporation (GFX), our wholly-owned subsidiary that trades futures contracts to enhance liquidity in our electronic markets for these products. Other revenues also include gains on sales from various investments.Primary ExpensesThe majority of our expenses do not vary directly with changes in our trading volume. Licensing and other fee agreements and the majority of our employee bonuses do vary directly with trading volume. 36Table of ContentsCompensation and benefits. Compensation and benefits expense is our most significant expense and includes employee wages, bonuses, stock-based compensation, benefits and employer taxes. Changes in this expense are driven by fluctuations in the number of employees, increases in wages as a result of inflation or labor market conditions, changes in rates for employer taxes and other cost increases affecting benefit plans. In addition, this expense is affected by the composition of our work force. The expense associated with our bonus and stock-based compensation plans can also have a significant impact on this expense category and may vary from year to year. The bonus component of our compensation and benefits expense is based on our financial performance. Under the performance criteria of our annual incentive plans, the bonus funded under the plans is based on achieving certain financial performance targets established by the compensation committee of our board of directors. The compensation committee may adjust the target level of performance for material, unplanned operating results or capital expenditures to meet intermediate to long-term growth opportunities. Stock-based compensation is a non-cash expense related to stock options, restricted stock and performance share grants. Stock-based compensation varies depending on the quantity and fair value of awards granted. The fair value of options is derived using the Black-Scholes model with assumptions about our dividend yield, the expected volatility of our stock price based on an analysis of implied and historical volatility, the risk-free interest rate and the expected life of the options granted. The fair value of other awards is based on either the share price on the date of the grant or a model of expected future stock prices. Amortization of purchased intangibles. This expense includes amortization of intangible assets obtained in our mergers with CBOT Holdings and NYMEX Holdings as well as other asset and business acquisitions. Intangible assets subject to amortization consist primarily of customer relationships, licensing agreements and lease-related intangible assets. Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense results from the depreciation of long-lived assets purchased, as well as the amortization of purchased and internally developed software. Professional fees and outside services. This expense includes costs of consulting services provided for strategic and technology initiatives as well as legal and accounting fees. This expense may fluctuate as a result of changes in services required to complete initiatives and legal proceedings.Other expenses. We incur additional ongoing expenses for communications, technology support services and various other activities necessary to support our operations. •Communications expense includes costs for network connections to our electronic trading platform and some market data customers; telecommunications costs of our exchange; and fees paid for access to external market data. This expense may be impacted by growth in electronic trading, our capacity requirements and changes in the number of telecommunications hubs and connections which allow customers outside the United States access to our electronic trading platform directly. •Technology support services consist of costs related to maintenance of the hardware and software required to support our technology. Our technology support services costs are driven by system capacity, functionality and redundancy requirements. •Occupancy and building operations expense consists of costs related to leased and owned property including rent, maintenance, real estate taxes, utilities and other related costs. We have significant operations located in Chicago and New York City with smaller offices located throughout Europe, North and South America, the Middle East and Asia. Additionally, we have trading facilities in Chicago and New York City as well as data centers in various U.S. locations. In June 2011, we announced that we are pursuing a sale and partial leaseback of the north and south buildings of CBOT. If the sale is completed, occupancy and building operations expense will decrease. •Licensing and other fee agreements expense includes license fees paid as a result of trading volume in equity index products, and royalty and broker rebates on energy and metals products. This expense fluctuates with changes in equity index product volume as well as CME ClearPort volumes and fee structure changes in the agreements. •Other expenses include marketing and travel-related as well as general and administrative costs. Marketing, advertising and public relations expense includes media, print and other advertising costs, as well as costs associated with our product promotion. Other expenses also include litigation and customer settlements as well as impairment of operational assets and restructuring expense resulting from our mergers with CBOT Holdings and NYMEX Holdings.Non-Operating Income and ExpensesIncome and expenses incurred through activities outside of our core operations are considered non-operating. These activities include investments in debt and equity securities for operational and strategic purposes and financing activities. •Investment income represents income generated by short-term investment of excess cash, clearing firms' cash performance bonds and guaranty fund contributions; income and net realized gains and losses from our marketable 37Table of Contentssecurities; gains and losses on trading securities in our non-qualified deferred compensation plans and dividend income from our strategic investments. Investment income is influenced by the availability of funds generated by operations, market interest rates, changes in the levels of cash performance bonds deposited by clearing firms as well as the amount of dividends distributed from our strategic investments. •We have used derivative financial instruments for the purpose of hedging exposures to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. Any ineffective or excluded portion of our hedges is recognized in earnings immediately. •Interest and other borrowing costs are associated with various short-term and long-term funding facilities. We maintain a commercial paper program with various financial institutions. In early 2009, we refinanced part of the debt that was previously issued for the NYMEX Holdings merger. In conjunction with its formation, Index Services issued long-term debt in March 2010. Our debt is fixed rate debt, but debt-related costs fluctuate with the funding needs of our business as our debt levels change. •Income related to our guarantee of exercise right privileges (ERPs) was a result of our merger with CBOT Holdings. Under the terms of the merger agreement, eligible holders of Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) ERPs could elect to sell us their ERP for $250,000 per privilege. Eligible holders that did not elect to sell their ERPs were entitled to a maximum guaranteed payment of $250,000 from us upon resolution of the lawsuit between CBOT and CBOE. This income represented the change in estimated fair value of our guarantee during the period, which was based in part on the expected outcome of the litigation. This litigation was resolved in December 2009. •Equity in net losses of unconsolidated subsidiaries includes income and losses from our investments in Dubai Mercantile Exchange, Green Exchange Holdings, LLC, Bursa Malaysia Derivatives Berhad and OneChicago LLC (OneChicago).•Other income (expense) includes income and expenses related to our securities lending program. CME's securities lending program has been suspended since 2008. NYMEX's securities lending program was terminated in June 2009. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIESThe notes to our consolidated financial statements include disclosure of our significant accounting policies. In establishing these policies within the framework of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, management must make certain assessments, estimates and choices that will result in the application of these principles in a manner that appropriately reflects our financial condition and results of operations. Critical accounting policies are those policies that we believe present the most complex or subjective measurements and have the most potential to affect our financial position and operating results. While all decisions regarding accounting policies are important, there are certain accounting policies that we consider to be critical. These critical policies, which are presented in detail in the notes to our consolidated financial statements, relate to valuation of financial instruments, goodwill and intangible assets, derivative instruments, revenue recognition, income taxes, and internal use software costs. Valuation of financial instruments. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, or an exit price. A hierarchy exists for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the observable inputs be used when available. Observable inputs are inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on market data obtained from independent sources. Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect our judgments about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances. We have categorized financial instruments measured at fair value into a three-level classification hierarchy. Classification is based on the reliability of inputs as follows: •Level 1—Inputs are unadjusted, quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date. Assets and liabilities carried at level 1 fair value generally include U.S. Treasury and Government agency securities, equity securities listed in active markets, and investments in publicly traded mutual funds with quoted market prices.•Level 2—Inputs are either directly or indirectly observable and corroborated by market data or are based on quoted prices in markets that are not active. Assets and liabilities carried at level 2 fair value generally include municipal bonds, corporate debt and certain derivatives.•Level 3—Inputs are unobservable and reflect management’s best estimate of what market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. Generally assets and liabilities at fair value utilizing level 3 inputs include certain other assets and liabilities with inputs that require management’s judgment.For further discussion regarding the fair value of financial assets and liabilities, see note 20 in the notes to the consolidated 38Table of Contentsfinancial statements. Goodwill and intangible assets. We review goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment on an annual basis and whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Goodwill is assessed for impairment using a two-step test. In the first step, the fair value of each reporting unit is compared to its carrying amount. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying amount, no impairment exists and we are not required to perform further testing. If the carrying amount exceeds its fair value, the second step must be performed to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill. If the carrying value of the reporting unit's goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, then an impairment loss is recorded in an amount equal to that excess. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. Valuation techniques we use to measure fair value include the market approach and the income approach. The market approach encompasses comparable data sets within our peer group, and the income approach includes discounted cash flow measurements using a market discount rate. Our valuation techniques could yield variable results based on changes in assumptions such as the discount rate and long-term growth rate and forecasted revenue and expense. In the third quarter of 2011, the company adopted newly-issued guidance on goodwill impairment testing. The guidance permits companies to perform a qualitative impairment assessment of goodwill that may allow them to omit the annual two-step quantitative test. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are assessed for impairment by comparing their fair values to their carrying values. If the carrying value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the difference. The estimate of the fair value of all intangible assets is generally determined on the basis of discounted future cash flows. In estimating the fair value, management must make assumptions and projections regarding such items as the discount rate, long-term growth rate, forecasted revenue and expenses, and other factors. Such assumptions are subject to change as a result of changing economic and competitive conditions. Intangible assets subject to amortization are also evaluated for impairment when indicated by a change in economic or operational circumstances. The impairment testing requires management to first compare the book value of the amortizing asset to undiscounted cash flows. If the book value exceeds the undiscounted cash flows, management is then required to estimate the fair value of the assets and record an impairment loss for the excess of the carrying value over the fair value. Derivative investments. We use derivative financial instruments for the purpose of hedging exposures to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. Derivatives are recorded at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets. Changes in our derivatives' fair values are recognized in earnings unless the instruments are accounted for as cash flow hedges. For a derivative designated as a fair value hedge, any gain or loss on the derivative is recognized in earnings in the period of change, to the extent the hedge is effective, together with the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the risk being hedged. We record the effective portions of our derivative financial instruments that are designated as cash flow hedges in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. In the period during which the hedged item affects earnings, the gain or loss included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) is transferred to the same line in the consolidated statements of income as the hedged item. Any ineffective or excluded portion of a hedge is recognized in earnings immediately. Any realized gains and losses from effective hedges are classified in the consolidated statements of income consistent with the accounting treatment of the items being hedged.Revenue recognition. A significant portion of our revenue is derived from the clearing and transaction fees we assess on each contract executed through our trading venues and cleared through our clearing houses. Clearing and transaction fees are recognized as revenue when a buy and sell order are matched and when the trade is cleared. On occasion, the customer's exchange trading privileges may not be properly entered by the clearing firm and incorrect fees are charged for the transactions in the affected accounts. When this information is corrected within the time period allowed by the exchange, a fee adjustment is provided to the clearing firm. An accrual is established for estimated fee adjustments to reflect corrections to customer exchange trading privileges. The accrual is based on the historical pattern of adjustments processed as well as specific adjustment requests. Occasionally market data customers will pay for services in a lump sum payment. When these circumstances occur, revenue is recognized as services are provided. Income taxes. Calculation of the income tax provision includes an estimate of the income taxes that will be paid for the current year as well as an estimate of income tax liabilities or benefits deferred into future years. Deferred tax assets are reviewed to determine if they will be realized in future periods. To the extent it is determined that some deferred tax assets may not be fully realized, the assets are reduced to their realizable value by a valuation allowance. The calculation of our tax provision involves uncertainty in the application of complex tax regulations. We recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the United States and other applicable foreign tax jurisdictions using a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold based on the technical merits of the tax position taken or expected to be taken. If payment of these amounts varies from our estimate, our income tax provision would be reduced or increased at the time that determination is made. This determination may not be known for several years. Past tax audits have not resulted in tax adjustments that would result in a material change to the income tax provision in the year the audit was completed. The effective tax rate, defined as the income tax provision as a 39Table of Contentspercentage of income before income taxes, will vary from year to year based on changes in tax jurisdictions, tax rates and regulations. In addition, the effective tax rate will vary with changes to income that are not subject to income tax, such as municipal interest income, and changes in expenses or losses that are not deductible, such as the utilization of foreign net operating losses. Internal use software costs. Certain costs for employees and consultants that are incurred in connection with work on development or implementation of software for our internal use are capitalized. Costs are capitalized for software projects that will result in significant new functionality and are generally expected to cost in excess of $0.5 million. The amount capitalized is determined based on the time spent by the individuals completing the eligible software-related activity and the compensation and benefits or consulting fees incurred for these activities. Projects are monitored during the development cycle to assure that they continue to meet the capitalization criteria and that the project will be completed and placed in service as intended. Any previously capitalized costs are expensed at the time a decision is made to abandon a software project. Completed internal use software projects, as well as work-in-progress projects, are included as part of property in the consolidated balance sheets. Once complete, the accumulated costs for a particular software project are amortized over the anticipated life of the software, generally three years. Costs capitalized for internal use software will vary from year to year based on our technology-related business requirements.RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTSIn May 2011, Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued an Accounting Standards Update (ASU) for Fair Value Measurement. The ASU provides clarity on existing fair value measurement and disclosure requirements, and is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011, with no early adoption permitted. We will adopt the disclosure requirements once the guidance becomes effective. In June 2011, FASB issued an ASU for Presentation of Comprehensive Income. The ASU requires entities to report components of comprehensive income in either a continuous statement of comprehensive income or two separate but consecutive statements, and to present reclassification adjustments out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component in the income statement and in the other comprehensive income statement. The ASU is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011, with early adoption permitted. In December 2011, FASB issued an ASU that indefinitely deferred the reclassification adjustments presentation. We will adopt the disclosure requirements once the guidance becomes effective. In December 2011, FASB issued an ASU for Balance Sheet Offsetting Disclosure Requirements. The ASU requires entities to disclose both gross and net information about instruments and transactions eligible for offset in the financial statements, as well as instruments and transactions subject to an agreement similar to a master netting arrangement. The ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2013, and interim periods therein, with retrospective application required. We will adopt the disclosure requirements once the guidance becomes effective. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS2011 Financial HighlightsThe comparability of our operating results for the periods presented is impacted by the formation of Index Services in March 2010. The following summarizes significant changes in our financial performance for the years presented. Year-over-Year Change(dollars in millions, except per share data) 2011 2010 2009 2011-2010 2010-2009Total revenues $3,280.6 $3,003.7 $2,612.8 9 % 15 %Total expenses 1,259.5 1,172.6 1,023.7 7 15Operating margin 62% 61% 61% Non-operating income (expense) $(84.6) $(109.2) $(151.6) (22) (28)Effective tax rate 6% 45% 43% Net income attributable to CME Group $1,812.3 $951.4 $825.8 90 15Diluted earnings per common share attributable to CME Group 27.15 14.31 12.41 90 15Cash flows from operating activities 1,346.3 1,356.4 1,083.1 (1) 25•The increase in revenues from 2009 to 2011 was attributable to an increase in contract volume as well as an increase in market data and information services revenue.40Table of Contents•From 2009 to 2011, higher compensation and benefits, amortization of purchased intangibles, as well as professional fees and outside services, contributed to an increase in expense. The increase in 2011 compared with 2010 was partially offset by 2010 impairment charges on the goodwill and trade name related to our CMA operations. •Non-operating income (expense) decreased in 2011 compared with 2010 due to lower interest expenses resulting from the repayment of the $420.5 million term loan in January 2011 and the maturity of the $300.0 million floating rate notes in August 2010. The decrease in 2010 compared with 2009 was attributable to $46.0 million of impairment of long-term investments in 2009.•The decrease in effective tax rate in 2011 compared with 2010 was the result of a reduction in state tax apportionment which resulted in a reduction in our income tax provision of $646.0 million largely due to a revaluation of our deferred tax liabilities. In addition, in the first quarter of 2011, we began marking to market our investment in BM&FBOVESPA which resulted in a $48.8 million reduction in valuation allowances on other unrealized capital losses previously reserved. The effective tax rate increased in 2010 compared with 2009 due to a $51.2 million charge to record the impact of our new combined state and local tax rate on our existing deferred tax liabilities. Our state and local tax rate increased due to revised state apportionment estimates resulting from annual state tax filings. •Cash flows from operations are correlated with trading volume. In 2011 when compared with 2010, the increase in cash flows from operations due to trading volumes was partially offset by an increase in other current assets and other assets resulting from an increase in restricted cash. Revenues Year-over-Year Change(dollars in millions) 2011 2010 2009 2011-2010 2010-2009Clearing and transaction fees $2,710.9 $2,486.3 $2,161.9 9% 15%Market data and information services 427.7 395.1 331.1 8 19Access and communication fees 49.2 45.4 45.6 8 —Other 92.8 76.9 74.2 21 4Total Revenues $3,280.6 $3,003.7 $2,612.8 9 15Clearing and Transaction FeesThe following table summarizes our total contract volume, revenue and average rate per contract. Total contract volume includes contracts that are traded on our exchange and cleared through our CME clearing house. Contract volume also includes cleared-only CME ClearPort contracts. Volume is measured in round turns, which is considered a completed transaction which involves a purchase and an offsetting sale of a contract. Average rate per contract is determined by dividing total clearing and transaction fee revenues by total contract volume. All amounts exclude our TRAKRS, credit default swap, interest rate swap and CMECE contracts.

Year-over-Year Change(in millions) 2011-2010 2010-2009Increase due to change in total volume $247.0 $398.4Decrease due to change in average rate per contract (22.4) (73.9)Net increase in clearing and transaction fees $224.6 $324.5Average rate per contract is impacted by our rate structure, including volume-based incentives; product mix; trading venue; and the percentage of volume executed by customers who are members compared with non-member customers. Due to the relationship between average rate per contract and volume, the change in revenues attributable to changes in each is only an 41Table of Contentsapproximation.Contract VolumeThe following table summarizes average daily contract volume. Contract volume can be influenced by many factors, including political and economic factors, the regulatory environment and market competition.From December 31, 2011 through the date the financial statements were issued, overall volume declined compared with 2011. The decrease in volume is attributable to lower volatility within the equity market, as measured by the CBOE Volatility Index, as well as lower volatility in short-term interest rates. Year-over-Year Change(amounts in thousands) 2011 2010 2009 2011-2010 2010-2009Average Daily Volume by Product Line: Interest rate 6,030 5,449 4,260 11% 28 %Equity 3,238 2,907 2,916 11 —Foreign exchange 922 919 624 — 47Agricultural commodity 1,087 914 741 19 23Energy 1,775 1,662 1,492 7 11Metal 387 316 225 23 40Aggregate average daily volume 13,439 12,167 10,258 10 19 Average Daily Volume by Venue: Electronic 11,350 10,120 8,290 12 22Open outcry 1,398 1,402 1,310 — 7Privately negotiated 231 198 164 17 21Total exchange-traded volume 12,979 11,720 9,764 11 20Total CME ClearPort 460 447 494 3 (10)Aggregate average daily volume 13,439 12,167 10,258 10 19Electronic Volume as a Percentage of Average Daily Volume 84% 83% 81% Interest Rate ProductsThe following table summarizes average daily volume for our key interest rate products. Eurodollar front 8 contracts include contracts expiring within two years. Eurodollar back 32 contracts include contracts expiring within three to ten years. Year-over-Year Change(amounts in thousands) 2011 2010 2009 2011-2010 2010-2009Eurodollar futures and options: Front 8 futures 1,717 1,646 1,482 4% 11%Back 32 futures 510 357 238 43 50Options 767 726 639 6 14U.S. Treasury futures and options: 10-Year 1,454 1,380 913 5 515-Year 720 546 410 32 33Treasury bond 415 388 292 7 332-Year 297 274 201 8 37In 2011 when compared with 2010, the overall increase in interest rate contract volume was attributable to volatility caused by a change in market expectations regarding short-term and long-term interest rates tied to the Federal Reserve's announcement in 2011 that it intends to maintain its zero interest rate policy through 2013. In addition, volatility caused by the downgrade of the United States credit rating also contributed to an increase in overall volume. Mid-term interest rate contract volume, which includes Eurodollar back 32 futures and 5-year U.S. Treasury futures and options, grew at a faster rate than short-term contract volume because of a shift from contracts based on short-term interest rates to mid-term interest rates due to the continued zero interest rate policy through 2013.42Table of ContentsWe also believe that overall U.S. Treasury futures and options contract volume increased in 2011 when compared with 2010 due to institutional portfolio adjustments caused by the downgrade of the United States credit rating. Many institutional portfolios are required to maintain an average minimum overall credit rating. When the U.S. Treasury credit rating was downgraded, the institutional portfolios had to sell investments with lower credit ratings and buy more U.S. Treasuries in order to increase their average minimum overall credit rating. In addition, the growth in overall U.S. Treasury futures and options contract volume was attributable to increased demand for U.S. Treasury securities as a safe haven investment during the European credit crisis.The overall growth in interest rate contract volume in 2011 when compared with 2010 was partially offset by a decrease in volume in the fourth quarter of 2011 compared with the fourth quarter of 2010. We believe the decline in volume in the fourth quarter of 2011 was attributable to low interest rate volatility as well as the MF Global bankruptcy as well as stronger seasonal factors in the fourth quarter of 2011 compared with the same period of 2010. In 2010 when compared with 2009, overall interest rate product volume increased due to the overall improvement in the economic environment in 2010 following the credit crisis. Specifically, in the second half of 2010, a continuing zero interest rate policy in the United States and the Federal Reserve's announcement that it would buy additional U.S. Treasury securities to stimulate the economy led to changing expectations about interest rates as well as increased market participants' use of these products. The change in expectations contributed to an increase in volume for longer-term U.S. Treasury products which was only partially offset by slower growth in volume for short-term Eurodollar products.We believe that the increase in overall Eurodollar products volume in 2010, when compared with 2009, resulted from uncertainty surrounding the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) due to the European credit crisis throughout early 2010. In addition, changing expectations about the Federal Reserve's monetary policy led to increased volume for longer-dated Eurodollar products.In 2010, when compared with 2009, we believe that the increase in U.S. Treasury note futures and options volume was attributable to the additional U.S. Treasury note issuance by the U.S. government as well as rising intermediate and long-term interest rates during 2010.Equity ProductsThe following table summarizes average daily volume for our key equity products. Year-over-Year Change(amounts in thousands) 2011 2010 2009 2011-2010 2010-2009E-mini S&P 500 futures and options 2,605 2,285 2,280 14 % —%E-mini NASDAQ 100 futures and options 301 317 311 (5) 2In 2011 when compared with 2010, an overall increase in volatility, as measured by the CBOE Volatility Index, contributed to an increase in equity contract volume. We experienced periods of high volatility within the equity markets during the third quarter of 2011, which we believe was attributable to the downgrade of the United States credit rating and the continuation of the sovereign debt crisis in Europe. We also experienced short periods of high volatility in May 2010 due to the start of the sovereign debt crisis in Europe, which we believe contributed to additional volume in 2010. In general, equity products such as the E-mini NASDAQ contracts that hedge market risks different than those of the E-mini S&P 500, our most liquid equity product, do not tend to benefit from macro-level events or increased volatility to the same extent.Growth in equity products volume was relatively unchanged in 2010 when compared with 2009. We believe an improved economic outlook leading to increased investment in the equities market contributed to an increase in volume in 2010. This increase was offset by a decrease in volume attributable to a decline in average volatility for equity products, as measured by the CBOE Volatility Index, in 2010 when compared with 2009.43Table of ContentsForeign Exchange ProductsThe following table summarizes average daily volume for our key foreign exchange products. Year-over-Year Change(amounts in thousands) 2011 2010 2009 2011-2010 2010-2009Euro 357 367 225 (3)% 63%Australian dollar 126 105 68 20 55Japanese yen 118 131 93 (10) 41British pound 118 124 100 (5) 24Canadian dollar 92 91 63 1 43In 2011 when compared with 2010, foreign exchange contract volume remained at a consistent level. We believe that intervention by the Japanese central bank to control the yen foreign exchange rate and uncertainty about the Euro as a result of the European credit crisis caused the market to move to safe haven currencies, such as the Australian dollar and the Canadian dollar. As a result, Euro and Japanese yen contract volume decreased while Australian dollar volume increased.We believe that the increase in volume in 2010, when compared with 2009, was attributable to the weakening of the Euro and British pound compared with the U.S. dollar. Uncertainty surrounding the Euro following the European credit crisis contributed to increased volatility, which led to increased trading volume for the Euro products in 2010 when compared with 2009. We also believe that the strengthening of the yen compared with the U.S. dollar contributed to an increase in volume. In addition, our cross-selling efforts to market participants in other asset classes as well as increased global sales presence contributed to growth in volume.Agricultural Commodity ProductsThe following table summarizes average daily volume for our key agricultural commodity products. Year-over-Year Change(amounts in thousands) 2011 2010 2009 2011-2010 2010-2009Corn 426 358 259 19% 38%Soybean 232 186 180 25 3Wheat 115 109 85 5 29Soybean Oil 105 89 73 18 23We believe that the year-over-year increases in contract volume from 2009 to 2011 were attributable to a decline in supply due to various weather events including flooding, drought and excessive heat. The change in supply resulted in increased volatility and higher grain prices. We also believe that the increase in volume resulted from increased demand for feedgrains caused by increased demand for cattle and other proteins in emerging markets.Energy ProductsThe following table summarizes average daily volume for our key energy products. Year-over-Year Change(amounts in thousands) 2011 2010 2009 2011-2010 2010-2009Crude oil 900 853 712 5% 20%Natural gas 533 489 478 9 2Refined products 275 244 194 13 26In 2011 when compared with 2010, we believe the increase in energy contract volume was attributable to increased price volatility within the energy market during the first quarter of 2011. We believe that increased volatility caused by changes in global supply and demand resulting from political unrest in the Middle East in the first quarter of 2011 contributed to the increase in crude oil and refined products volume. We also believe that increased volatility caused by weather-related events led to an increase in natural gas contract volume in 2011.In 2010 when compared with 2009, we believe that the growth in energy contract volume was attributable to an improved economic outlook as well as increased liquidity within the energy futures market during the period. We believe crude oil and refined products contract volume increased at a higher rate than natural gas contract volume due to an increase in volume generated from customers outside the United States as well as increased volatility in the crude oil and refined products market.44Table of ContentsMetal ProductsThe following table summarizes average daily volume for our key metal products. Year-over-Year Change(amounts in thousands) 2011 2010 2009 2011-2010 2010-2009Gold 238 208 159 14% 31%Silver 87 57 36 51 59The overall increase in metal contract volume from 2009 to 2011 was attributable to the increased investment in precious metals as an asset class due to high volatility and uncertainty within the financial markets. We believe that there has been an increase in silver contract volume due to the greater use of silver as an alternative investment.Average Rate per ContractThe average rate per contract decreased from 2009 to 2011 due to an increase in member trading volume, which increased faster than non-member trading. In general, members receive lower rates when compared with non-members. In addition, the average rate per contract decreased in 2010 compared with 2009 due to a lower portion of equity and energy products as a percentage of total volume compared with interest rate products. As a percentage of volume, equity products volume decreased by 4% and energy product volume decreased by 1% while interest rate product volume increased by 3%. Equity and energy products have higher fees compared with interest rate products.Concentration of RevenueWe bill a substantial portion of our clearing and transaction fees to our clearing firms. The majority of clearing and transaction fees received from clearing firms represent charges for trades executed and cleared on behalf of their customers. One firm represented 12% of our clearing and transaction fees revenue in 2011. One firm represented 13% and one firm represented 12% of our clearing and transaction fees revenue in 2010. One firm represented 13% and one firm represented 11% of our clearing and transaction fees revenue in 2009. Should a clearing firm withdraw, we believe that the customer portion of the firm's trading activity would likely transfer to another clearing firm of the exchange. Therefore, we do not believe we are exposed to significant risk from an ongoing loss of revenue received from or through a particular clearing firm. In 2011, MF Global, one of our largest clearing firms, was placed into bankruptcy and we transferred all of their more than 30,000 customer accounts to other futures commission merchants. Other Sources of RevenueRevenues from Index Services contributed to an increase in market data and information services revenue from 2009 to 2011. In March 2010, we formed Index Services, which contributed to an increase in revenues of $54.9 million in 2010 when compared with 2009 and an increase of $35.6 million in 2011 when compared with 2010. In addition, revenues from Index Services, which include revenue from market data and licensing, increased in 2011 when compared with 2010 due to growth in assets under management, which was driven by underlying index market performance. An increase in the basic device monthly fee in 2010 also contributed to an increase in overall market data and information services revenues in 2010 when compared with 2009. The overall increase from 2009 to 2011 was partially offset by a decline in revenue due to a decrease in basic device counts resulting from cost-cutting initiatives at customer firms.Effective January 1, 2012, users of our basic service will pay $70 per month for each device compared with $61 per month in 2011 and 2010.The two largest resellers of our market data represented approximately 39%, 45% and 55% of our market data and information services revenue in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Despite this concentration, we consider exposure to significant risk of revenue loss to be minimal. In the event that one of these vendors no longer subscribes to our market data, we believe the majority of that vendor's customers would likely subscribe to our market data through another reseller. Additionally, several of our largest institutional customers that utilize services from our two largest resellers report usage and remit payment of their fees directly to us.In the fourth quarter of 2011, we substantially completed installations of equipment for customers in our co-location program, which resulted in incremental revenue of $3.4 million in 2011 when compared with 2010. Co-location services launched on January 29, 2012. In the second quarter of 2011, we recognized a $9.8 million gain on sale of certain Index Services assets related to one of its service offerings. The gain contributed to the increase in other revenue in 2011 when compared with 2010. In addition, in 2011 when compared with 2010, we generated incremental processing services revenue of $4.3 million from various strategic 45Table of Contentsrelationships and incremental licensing fee revenue of $3.4 million. The increase in other revenues in 2011 when compared with 2010 was partially offset by a decrease in revenues of $4.4 million generated from our agreement with BM&FBOVESPA S.A. (BM&FBOVESPA) to develop a new multi-asset class electronic platform because the initial development phase was completed in the third quarter of 2011. Other revenues increased in 2010 when compared with 2009 due to $10.7 million of revenue generated from our agreement with BM&FBOVESPA and incremental processing services revenue generated from various strategic relationships. This was partially offset by a $6.3 million decline in trading revenues generated by GFX Corporation (GFX) resulting from lower trading activity and narrower trading margins.Expenses Year-over-Year Change(dollars in millions) 2011 2010 2009 2011-2010 2010-2009Compensation and benefits $475.7 $432.1 $351.0 10 % 23 %Communications 42.3 40.6 47.0 4 (14)Technology support services 52.1 50.5 46.2 3 9Professional fees and outside services 126.1 117.5 85.1 7 38Amortization of purchased intangibles 132.0 128.1 125.1 3 2Depreciation and amortization 128.5 129.9 126.3 (1) 3Occupancy and building operations 77.5 74.9 76.3 3 (2)Licensing and other fee agreements 84.9 82.6 89.2 3 (7)Other 140.4 116.4 77.5 21 50Total Expenses $1,259.5 $1,172.6 $1,023.7 7 152011 Compared With 2010Operating expenses increased by $86.9 million in 2011 when compared with 2010.

An increase in average headcount primarily due to the formation of Index Services and investment in strategic growth initiatives also contributed to an increase in expense in 2011 when compared with 2010.Expenses increased due to the MF Global bankruptcy filing in the fourth quarter of 2011, which resulted in write-offs of accounts receivable, legal fees and loss on collateral posted by GFX and held by MF Global in customer segregrated funds as well as a other related expenses. Stock-based compensation increased in 2011 due to the expense impact related to the September 2010 and 2011 grants.Marketing expenses increased in 2011 due primarily to new advertising initiatives.A decrease in professional fees was attributable to the formation and integration of Index Services, which occurred in the first quarter of 2010.Impairment charges recorded in the second quarter of 2010 on the goodwill and trade name related to our CMA operations also contributed to a decrease in expenses in 2011 when compared with 2010.46Table of Contents2010 Compared With 2009Operating expenses increased by $148.9 million in 2010 when compared with 2009.

Our improved performance relative to our 2010 cash earnings target compared with 2009 relative to our 2009 cash earnings target led to the increase in our bonus expense. Impairment charges on goodwill and trade name related to our CMA operations in the second quarter of 2010 led to an increase in expenses in 2010. Global expansion and establishment of strategic partnerships contributed to an increase in marketing and travel expenses in 2010. The increase in expenses in 2010 was also due to professional fee expenses incurred for Index Services. This increase included $10.3 million of professional and legal fees incurred for the formation of Index Services. Non-Operating Income (Expense) Year-over-Year Change(dollars in millions) 2011 2010 2009 2011-2010 2010-2009Investment income $36.7 $42.3 $28.5 (13)% 48 %Impairment of long-term investments — (2.2) (46.0) (100) (95)Gains (losses) on derivative investments (0.1) (2.6) — (96) n.m.Interest and other borrowing costs (116.9) (140.3) (133.9) (17) 5Guarantee of exercise rights privileges — — 4.3 — (100)Equity in net losses of unconsolidated subsidiaries (4.3) (6.4) (6.8) (33) (6)Other income (expense) — — 2.3 — (100)Total Non-Operating $(84.6) $(109.2) $(151.6) (22) (28) _______________n.m. not meaningfulInvestment Income. The decrease in investment income during 2011 when compared with 2010 was due to a decline in gains on marketable securities related to our non-qualified deferred compensation plans of $4.1 million. Gains and losses from these non-qualified deferred compensation plan securities are offset by an equal amount of compensation and benefits expense. In addition, we recognized a gain of $3.7 million from the sale of various equity and debt securities in 2010, which contributed to the decrease in investment income in 2011 when compared with 2010. The decrease in 2011 when compared with 2010 was partially offset by an increase in dividend income from our investment in BM&FBOVESPA. Total overall dividend income was $34.9 million in 2011 compared with $31.9 million in 2010. The increase in investment income in 2010 when compared with 2009 was attributable to a $16.0 million increase in dividend income from our investments in BM&FBOVESPA, TMX Group Inc. and Bolsa Mexicana de Valores, S.A.B. de C.V., and a $3.7 million gain resulting from the sale of various equity and debt securities. The increase was partially offset by a $4.8 million decrease in interest income as a result of lower average investment balances and lower average interest rates. 47Table of ContentsImpairment of Long-Term Investments. In 2010, we determined that our investment in OneChicago was impaired based on its historical financial performance and other factors. As a result, we recognized an impairment charge of $2.2 million. In 2009, we determined that our investment in DME was impaired due to the excess of our carrying value over our investment's estimated fair value. As a result, we recognized an impairment charge of $23.6 million. We also determined that our investment in IMAREX ASA (IMAREX) was impaired due to an extended and significant decline in the market price of its stock. As a result, we recognized an impairment charge of $22.4 million in 2009.Gains (Losses) on Derivative Investments. In the fourth quarter of 2010, we recognized an $8.6 million loss due to ineffectiveness on the interest rate swap contract used to hedge interest rate risk on our term loan. Both the swap contract and the term loan were originally scheduled to expire in August 2011. In December 2010, we approved a plan to refinance the term loan in January 2011 resulting in ineffectiveness of the hedge. Additionally, in March 2010, we recognized a $6.0 million gain on derivative investments as a result of a settlement from the Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (Lehman) bankruptcy proceedings. The settlement related to an unsecured claim against Lehman as counterparty to an over-the-counter put option contract we purchased to hedge our risk of changes in the fair value of BM&FBOVESPA stock resulting from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and the Brazilian real.Interest and Other Borrowing Costs. Interest expense decreased in 2011 compared with 2010 due to repayment of the $420.5 million term loan in January 2011 and the maturity of the $300.0 million floating rate notes in August 2010. The decrease in 2011 compared with 2010 was partially offset by the issuance, in March 2010, of $612.5 million of 4.40% fixed rate notes, which are due in 2018.In 2010 when compared with 2009, interest expense increased due to the issuance of $612.5 million of 4.40% fixed rate notes due 2018. This resulted in an increase in average effective yield and total cost of borrowing. However, average debt balances decreased in 2010 due to the reduction in overall debt levels throughout the year. The increase in expense was also attributable to a full year of interest expense recognized on the 5.75% fixed rate notes issued in February 2009.

In December 2009, final approval of the settlement of the ERPs associated with our CBOT Holdings merger occurred and we reduced our liability associated with our guarantee of the ERPs to zero, which resulted in a gain in 2009. Following the resolution of the lawsuit, we also adjusted the value of the 159 ERPs that we held to the expected settlement value, which also contributed to the gain in 2009.Other Income (Expense). In 2009, we recognized income and expense related to the NYMEX securities lending program, which was terminated in June 2009. Income Tax ProvisionThe following table summarizes the effective tax rate for the periods presented: 2011 2010 2009 Year-over-Year Change2011-2010 2010-2009Year ended December 316.3% 44.7% 42.6% (38.4)% 2.1%In 2011 when compared with 2010, the decrease in our effective tax rate was the result of a reduction in state tax apportionment which resulted in a reduction in our income tax provision of $646.0 million, including a $527.9 million decrease in the income tax provision in the fourth quarter of 2011, largely due to a revaluation of our deferred tax liabilities. Additionally, in the first quarter of 2011, we began marking to market our investment in BM&FBOVESPA which resulted in a $48.8 million reduction in valuation allowances on other unrealized capital losses previously reserved.The increase in the effective tax rate in 2010 when compared with 2009 was attributable to a $51.2 million charge to record the 48Table of Contentsimpact of our new combined state and local tax rate on our existing deferred tax liabilities. The state and local tax rate increased due to revised state apportionment estimates resulting from annual state tax filings. The increase in the effective tax rate was also due to the impairment of CMA's goodwill and trade name in the second quarter of 2010 which was not deductible. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESCash Requirements. We have historically met our funding requirements with cash generated by our ongoing operations. While our cost structure is fixed in the short term, our sources of operating cash are dependent on trading volume levels. We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to cover our working capital needs, capital expenditures, and other commitments. However, it is possible that we may need to raise additional funds to finance our activities through issuances of commercial paper, future public debt offerings or by direct borrowings from financial institutions. Cash will also be required for operating leases and non-cancellable purchase obligations as well as other obligations reflected as long-term liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2011. These were as follows: (in millions) OperatingLeases PurchaseObligations OtherLong-TermLiabilities Total(1)Year 2012 $22.1 $5.8 $40.4 $68.32013-2014 50.9 0.8 — 51.72015-2016 45.5 0.7 — 46.2Thereafter 135.6 — — 135.6Total $254.1 $7.3 $40.4 $301.8(1)Gross unrecognized income tax liabilities, including interest and penalties, of $53.9 million for uncertain tax positions are not included in the table due to uncertainty about the date of their settlement.Operating leases include rent payments for office space in Chicago and other smaller offices in the United States and in various foreign countries. The operating lease for our headquarters in Chicago expires in November 2022. Annual minimum rental payments under this lease range from $10.1 million to $13.5 million. We also maintain an operating lease for additional office space in Chicago, which expires in November 2023. Annual minimum rental payments under this lease range from $4.5 million to $6.2 million. Purchase obligations include minimum payments due under agreements to purchase software licenses, hardware and maintenance as well as telecommunication services. Other long-term liabilities include primarily funding obligations for pension and other post-retirement benefit plans as well as contingent consideration. Future capital expenditures for technology are anticipated as we continue to support our growth through investment in our co-location program, increased system capacity and performance improvements. Each year, capital expenditures are incurred for improvements to and expansion of our offices, remote data centers, telecommunications network and other operating equipment. In 2012, we expect capital expenditures to total between $140.0 million and $150.0 million. We continue to monitor our capital needs and may revise our forecasted expenditures as necessary in the future. We intend to continue to pay a regular quarterly dividend to our shareholders. The decision to pay a dividend, however, remains within the discretion of our board of directors and may be affected by various factors, including our earnings, financial condition, capital requirements, levels of indebtedness and other considerations our board of directors deems relevant. CME Group is also required to comply with restrictions contained in the general corporation laws of its state of incorporation which could also limit its (or their) ability to declare and pay dividends. On February 1, 2012, our board approved a change in our annual dividend policy to increase the distribution target from approximately 35% of the prior year's cash earnings to approximately 50% of the prior year's cash earnings. On February 1, 2012, the board of directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of $2.23 per share. The board of directors also declared an additional, annual variable dividend of $3.00 per share. Going forward, this dividend will be considered in the first quarter of each year and will supplement the regular dividend. The amount of the annual variable dividend will be determined after the end of each year, and the level will increase or decrease from year to year based on operating results, potential merger and acquisition activity, and other forms of capital return including regular dividends and share buybacks during the prior year. Both dividends will be payable on March 26, 2012 to shareholders of record on March 9, 2012. Assuming no changes in the number of shares outstanding, the first quarter dividend payments will total approximately $345.8 million. 49Table of ContentsSources and Uses of Cash. The following is a summary of cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities. Year-over-Year Change(dollars in millions) 2011 2010 2009 2011-2010 2010-2009Net cash provided by operating activities $1,346.3 $1,356.4 $1,083.1 (1)% 25 %Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities (153.6) (108.4) 544.8 42 (120)Net cash used in financing activities (1,005.6) (653.4) (1,665.2) 54 (61)Operating activitiesNet cash provided by operating activities decreased slightly in 2011 when compared with 2010. Increased profitability as a result of higher trading volumes was offset by an increase in other current assets and other assets resulting from an increase in restricted cash. In 2011, net cash provided by operating activities was $468.1 million lower than net income, which was attributable to a decrease in deferred income tax liabilities, partially offset by amortization of purchased intangibles of $132.0 million and depreciation and amortization of $128.5 million. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities in 2010 when compared with 2009 was due to higher trading volumes and increased profitability. In 2010, net cash provided by operating activities was $404.3 million higher than net income. This increase was the result of depreciation and amortization expense of $129.9 million and amortization of purchased intangibles of $128.1 million. An increase in accrued expenses also contributed to the overall increase. Investing activitiesThe increase in cash used in investing activities in 2011 when compared with 2010 was due to the proceeds from the sale of a long-term investment and our ERPs in 2010.The termination of the NYMEX securities lending program in 2009 as well as the decrease in proceeds from marketable securities, net of purchases, of $278.2 million, contributed to the increase in cash used for investing in 2010 when compared with 2009. Financing activitiesThe increase in cash used in 2011 compared with 2010 was attributable to proceeds from our issuance of shares to BM&FBOVESPA in 2010 and an increase in cash dividends in 2011 when compared with 2010. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in share repurchases of $354.9 million in 2011 when compared with the same period in 2010.The decrease in cash used in 2010 relative to 2009 was attributable to a decrease in commercial paper repayments, net of proceeds and proceeds from our share issuance to BM&FBOVESPA in 2010. We also terminated the NYMEX securities lending program in 2009, which resulted in a decrease in the NYMEX securities lending program liabilities. The decrease was partially offset by an increase in share repurchases of $548.3 million in 2010. Share repurchases increased in an effort to offset most of the dilution associated with the issuance of shares to BM&FBOVESPA. Debt Instruments. The following table summarizes our debt outstanding as of December 31, 2011:(in millions) Par ValueFixed rate notes due August 2013, interest equal to 5.40% $750.0Fixed rate notes due February 2014, interest equal to 5.75% 750.0Fixed rate notes due March 2018, interest equal to 4.40%(1) 612.5(1)In March 2010, we completed an unregistered offering of fixed rate notes due 2018. Net proceeds from the offering were used to fund a distribution to Dow Jones in conjunction with our investment in Index Services. In February 2010, we entered into a forward-starting interest rate swap agreement that modified the interest obligation associated with these notes so that the interest payable on the notes effectively became fixed at a rate of 4.46%.We maintain a $1.0 billion multi-currency revolving senior credit facility with various financial institutions. The proceeds from the revolving senior credit facility can be used for general corporate purposes, which includes providing liquidity for our CME clearing house in certain circumstances and, if necessary, for maturities of commercial paper. As long as we are not in default under the new senior credit facility, we have the option to increase the facility up to $1.8 billion with the consent of the agent and lenders providing the additional funds. The senior credit facility matures in January 2014 and is voluntarily prepayable from time to time without premium or penalty. Under our credit facility, we are required to remain in compliance with a 50Table of Contentsconsolidated net worth test, which is defined as our consolidated shareholders' equity as of September 30, 2010, giving effect to share repurchases made and special dividends paid during the term of the agreement (and in no event greater than $2.0 billion in aggregate), multiplied by 0.65. We currently do not have any borrowings under this credit facility. We maintain a 364-day fully secured, committed line of credit with a consortium of domestic and international banks to be used in certain situations by our CME clearing house. We may use the proceeds to provide temporary liquidity in the unlikely event of a clearing firm default, in the event of a liquidity constraint or default by a depositary (custodian for our collateral), or in the event of a temporary disruption with the domestic payments system that would delay payment of settlement variation between us and our clearing firms. CME clearing firm guaranty fund contributions received in the form of U.S. Treasury securities, U.S. Government agency securities or money market mutual funds as well as the performance bond assets of a defaulting firm can be used to collateralize the facility. The line of credit provides for borrowings of up to $3.0 billion. At December 31, 2011, guaranty fund collateral available was $4.5 billion. We have the option to request an increase in the line from $3.0 billion to $5.0 billion. In addition to the 364-day fully secured, committed line of credit, we also have the option to use the $1.0 billion multi-currency revolving senior credit facility to provide liquidity for our clearing house in the unlikely event of default in certain circumstances. In addition, our 364-day fully secured, committed revolving line of credit contains a requirement that CME remain in compliance with a consolidated tangible net worth test, defined as CME consolidated shareholder's equity less intangible assets (as defined in the agreement), of not less than $375.0 million. In the event that CME elects to increase the facility, the minimum consolidated tangible net worth test would increase ratably up to $625.0 million. The indentures governing our fixed rate notes, our $1.0 billion multi-currency revolving senior credit facility and our 364-day fully secured, committed revolving line of credit for $3.0 billion do not contain specific covenants that restrict the ability to pay dividends. These documents, however, do contain other customary financial and operating covenants that place restrictions on the operations of the company that could indirectly affect the ability to pay dividends. At December 31, 2011, we have excess borrowing capacity for general corporate purposes of approximately $1.0 billion under our multi-currency revolving senior credit facility. As of December 31, 2011, we were in compliance with the various covenant requirements of all our debt facilities. CME Group, as a holding company, has no operations of its own. Instead, it relies on dividends declared and paid to it by its subsidiaries in order to provide a portion of the funds which it uses to pay dividends to its shareholders. To satisfy our performance bond obligation with Singapore Exchange Limited, we may pledge CME-owned U.S. Treasury securities in lieu of, or in combination with, irrevocable letters of credit. At December 31, 2011, the letters of credit totaled $161.0 million. GFX has a $15.0 million standby letter of credit. The letter of credit was posted as collateral with MF Global and is now held by the MF Global bankruptcy trustee. As of December 31, 2011, the letter of credit can still be drawn on by the trustee. The letter of credit expires on June 29, 2012. GFX now maintains its future positions and has collateral posted with another clearing firm. The following table summarizes our credit ratings as of December 31, 2011: Rating Agency Short-TermDebt Rating Long-TermDebt Rating OutlookStandard & Poor’s A1+ AA NegativeMoody’s Investors Service P1 Aa3 StableOn February 7, 2012, Standard & Poor's (S&P) lowered our long-term debt rating from AA to AA-, with a negative outlook. S&P affirmed our A1+ short-term ratings. Given our cash flow generation, our ability to pay down debt levels and our ability to refinance existing debt facilities if necessary, we expect to maintain an investment grade rating. As provided in the trust indenture documents, if our ratings are downgraded below investment grade due to a change of control, we are required to make an offer to repurchase our fixed rate notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements. As of December 31, 2011, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined by the regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission.Liquidity and Cash Management. Cash and cash equivalents totaled $1.0 billion at December 31, 2011 and $855.2 million at December 31, 2010. The balance retained in cash and cash equivalents is a function of anticipated or possible short-term cash needs, prevailing interest rates, our investment policy and alternative investment choices. A majority of our cash and cash equivalents balance is invested in money market mutual funds that invest only in U.S. Treasury securities or U.S. Government 51Table of Contentsagency securities. Our exposure to risk is minimal given the nature of the investments. Our practice is to have our pension plan 100% funded at each year end on a projected benefit obligation basis, while also satisfying any minimum required contribution and obtaining the maximum tax deduction. Based on our actuarial projections, we estimate that a $17.1 million contribution in 2012 will allow us to meet our funding goal. However, the amount of the actual contribution is contingent on the actual rate of return on our plan assets during 2012 and the December 31, 2012 discount rate. In November 2011, we announced that we will contribute certain assets of Index Services to a new index business venture with The McGraw-Hill Companies Inc (McGraw-Hill). As part of the agreement, we will also sell Credit Market Analysis Ltd. (CMA) to McGraw-Hill. The transaction is expected to close by June 2012, subject to regulatory approval and customary closing conditions. As part of the agreement, the company will have a long term, ownership-linked, exclusive license to list futures and options on futures based on the S&P Indices. 52Table of ContentsITEM 7A.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKWe are subject to various market risks, including those caused by changes in interest rates, credit, foreign currency exchange rates, and equity prices. Interest Rate Risk Debt outstanding at December 31, 2011 consisted of fixed rate borrowings of $2.1 billion. We did not have any variable rate borrowings as of December 31, 2011. Credit Risk Our clearing houses act as the counterparties to all trades consummated on our exchanges as well as through third-party exchanges and over-the-counter markets for which we provide clearing services. As a result, we are exposed to significant credit risk of third parties, including our clearing firms. We are also exposed, indirectly, to the credit risk of customers of our clearing firms. These parties may default on their obligations due to bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, operational failure or other reasons. In order to ensure performance, we establish and monitor financial requirements for our clearing firms. We set minimum performance bond requirements for our exchange-traded and over-the-counter products, including credit default swaps and interest rate swaps. For futures and options on futures, we typically establish performance bond requirements to cover at least 99% of expected price changes for a given product within a given historical period with further quantitative and qualitative considerations based on market risk. For cleared over-the-counter credit default and interest rate swaps, we typically establish performance bond requirements to cover at least 99% of expected price changes for a given product within a given historical period with further quantitative and qualitative considerations based on market risk. For CMECE clearing firms, we typically establish performance bond requirements to cover at least 95% to 99% of expected price changes for a given product within a given historical period with further quantitative and qualitative considerations based on market risk. Collateral deposited to meet performance bond requirements is charged at a discount rate to cover at least 99% of expected price and foreign currency changes for a given asset within a historical period. Discount rates vary depending on the type of collateral. We mark-to-market all open positions of CME and CMECE clearing firms at least twice a day and require payment from clearing firms whose positions have lost value and make payments to clearing firms whose positions have gained value. For select cleared-only markets, positions are marked-to-market daily with the capability to mark-to-market more frequently as market conditions warrant. These practices allow our clearing houses to identify quickly any clearing firms that may not be able to satisfy the financial obligations resulting from changes in the prices of their open contracts before those financial obligations become exceptionally large and jeopardize the ability of our clearing house to ensure performance of their open positions. This transparency makes it difficult for traders to hide losses or disguise unusual profits. Although we have policies and procedures to help ensure that our clearing firms can satisfy their obligations, these policies and procedures may not succeed in detecting problems or preventing defaults. We also have in place various measures intended to enable us to cover any default and maintain liquidity. We maintain three separate financial safeguard packages for our CME clearing firms; one for futures and options, one for cleared over-the-counter credit default swap contracts, and one for cleared over-the-counter interest rate swap contracts. In the unlikely event of a payment default by a clearing firm, we would first apply assets of the defaulting clearing firm to satisfy its payment obligation. These assets include the defaulting firm's guaranty fund contributions, performance bonds and any other available assets, such as assets required for membership and any associated trading rights. In addition, we would make a demand for payment pursuant to any applicable guarantee provided to the exchange by the parent company of the clearing firm. Thereafter, if the payment default remains unsatisfied, we would use our surplus funds for futures and options contracts, or our designated working capital for cleared over-the-counter credit default swap contracts and cleared over-the-counter interest rate swap contracts. We would then use guaranty fund contributions of other clearing firms within the respective financial safeguard package and funds collected through an assessment against solvent clearing firms within the respective financial safeguard package to satisfy the deficit. Surplus funds represent the amount of CME working capital reduced by an amount necessary to support normal operations and amounts designated by CME for our credit default swap and interest rate swap financial safeguard packages. We maintain a $3.0 billion 364-day fully secured, committed line of credit with a consortium of domestic and international banks to be used in certain situations by our CME clearing house. We have the option to request an increase in the line from $3.0 billion to $5.0 billion. We may use the proceeds to provide temporary liquidity in the unlikely event of a clearing firm default, in the event of a liquidity constraint or default by a depositary (custodian of the collateral), or in the event of a temporary disruption with the domestic payments system that would delay payment of settlement variation between us and our clearing firms. The credit agreement requires us to pledge certain assets to the line of credit custodian prior to drawing on the line of credit, such as clearing firm guaranty fund deposits held by us in the form of U.S. Treasury or agency securities, as well as select money market mutual funds approved for our select IEF programs. Performance bond collateral of a defaulting 53Table of Contentsclearing firm may also be used to secure a draw on the line. In addition to the 364-day fully secured, committed line of credit, we also have the option to use our $1.0 billion multi-currency revolving senior credit facility to provide liquidity for our clearing house in the unlikely event of default. Aggregate performance bond deposits for CME clearing firms for futures and options, cleared over-the-counter credit default swap contracts, and cleared over-the-counter interest rate swap contracts was $92.5 billion, including $8.1 billion of cash performance bond deposits. A defaulting firm's performance bond collateral can be used in the event of default of that clearing firm. The following shows the available assets of our CME clearing house at December 31, 2011 in the event of a payment default by a clearing firm for futures and options contracts after first utilizing the defaulting firm's available assets: (in millions) CME Clearing HouseAvailable AssetsCME surplus funds(1) $323.3Guaranty fund contributions(2) 2,967.8Assessment powers(3) 8,161.4Minimum Total Assets Available for Default(4) $11,452.5_______________(1)CME surplus funds represent the amount of working capital reduced by an amount necessary to support normal operations and the amounts designated by CME for our credit default swap and interest rate swap financial safeguard packages. Our target for the CME surplus funds is $100.0 million with amounts in excess of this target generally paid as a dividend from CME to CME Group on a quarterly basis based on prior quarter-end balances. (2)Guaranty fund contributions of clearing firms include guaranty fund contributions required of clearing firms, but do not include any excess deposits held by our exchange at the direction of clearing firms. (3)In the event of a clearing firm default, if a loss continues to exist after the utilization of the assets of the defaulted firm, CME surplus funds and the non-defaulting clearing firms' guaranty fund contributions, we have the right to assess all non-defaulting clearing members as defined in the rules governing the guaranty fund. (4)Represents the aggregate minimum resources available to satisfy any obligations not met by a defaulting firm subsequent to the liquidation of the defaulting firm's performance bond collateral.

(2)Guaranty fund contributions of clearing firms for credit default swap contracts include guaranty fund contributions required of those clearing firms. (3)Represents the aggregate minimum resources available to satisfy any obligations not met by a defaulting firm subsequent to the liquidation of the defaulting firm's performance bond collateral.

We maintain a separate financial safeguard package for CMECE clearing firms. In the unlikely event of a payment default by a CMECE clearing firm, we would first apply assets of the defaulting clearing firm to satisfy its payment obligation. These assets include the defaulting firm's performance bonds. Aggregate cash performance bond deposits for CMECE clearing firms was $26.0 million. There were no non-cash performance bonds on deposit at December 31, 2011. Thereafter, if the payment default remains unsatisfied after first applying assets of the defaulting clearing firm to satisfy its payment obligation, we would use $60.0 million of CMECE funds. As of December 31, 2011, guaranty fund contributions were contributed by CMECE. In 2012, the CMECE clearing firms may be asked to contribute to the CMECE guaranty fund and the size of the fund will be reviewed in light of the actual risk exposure. Once the CMECE clearing firms contribute to the guaranty fund, we would use at least $20.0 million of CMECE funds in the event of a default.Despite these safeguards, we cannot assure you that these measures will be sufficient to protect us from a default or that we will not be materially and adversely affected in the event of a significant default.Foreign Currency Exchange Rate RiskForeign Currency Transaction Risk Our exposure to foreign currency transaction risk resulting from our operations is considered minimal and is not expected to be material to our financial condition or operating results. Foreign Currency Translation Risk We have foreign currency translation risk related to the translation of our foreign subsidiaries' assets and liabilities from their respective functional currencies to the U.S. dollar at each reporting date. Fluctuations in exchange rates may impact the amount of total assets and liabilities we report in our consolidated balance sheets. The financial statements of certain of our foreign subsidiaries are denominated in various currencies, including the British pound and the Brazilian real, and are translated into U.S. dollars using a current exchange rate. Gains and losses resulting from this translation are recognized as a foreign currency translation adjustment within accumulated other comprehensive income, which is a component of shareholders' equity. The translation adjustment, net of tax, for 2011, 2010 and 2009 was $83.3 million, $(0.5) million and $2.6 million, respectively. In 2011, we reversed an unrealized loss of $81.7 million, net of tax, which was attributable to foreign currency translation adjustments that were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) upon recognizing impairment on our investment in BM&FBOVESPA. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, 3% and 10% of our consolidated cash and cash equivalents balances were held by foreign subsidiaries whose balance sheets were translated from a foreign functional currency to U.S. dollars at each reporting date. Other Foreign Currency Risk We are also exposed to foreign exchange rate risk related to the equity investments noted under Equity Price Risk. Any foreign exchange rate risk related to these investments is reflected in the Equity Price Risk section below. Foreign Currency Risk Related to Customer CollateralA portion of the performance bond deposits is denominated in foreign currency. We mark to market all collateral once daily and require payment from clearing firms whose collateral has lost value due to changes in foreign currency rates and price. In 55Table of Contentsaddition, we typically establish performance bond levels to cover at least 95% to 99% of expected price and foreign currency changes for a given product within a given historical period, which further reduces our exposure to foreign currency and other price risk. Collateral deposited to meet performance bond requirements is charged at a discount rate to cover at least 99% of expected price and foreign currency changes for a given asset within a historical period. Discount rates vary depending on the type of collateral. Therefore, our exposure to foreign currency risk related to customer collateral deposits is considered minimal and is not expected to be material to our financial condition or operating results.Equity Price RiskWe hold certain investments in equity securities for strategic purposes. Investments subject to equity price risks are generally recorded at their fair value. Fair values for publicly-traded equity investments are based on quoted market prices. Fair values are subject to fluctuation and, consequently, the amount realized in the subsequent sale of an investment may differ significantly from its current reported value. Fluctuation in the market price of a security may result from perceived changes in the underlying economic characteristics of the issuer, the relative price of alternative investments and general market conditions. The table below summarizes our equity investments subject to equity price fluctuation at December 31, 2011. Equity investments are included in other assets in our consolidated balance sheets.

Equity investments are assessed for other-than-temporary impairment on a quarterly basis.

(CBOT) acquired a 90% ownership interest in CME Group Index Services LLC (Index Services), a business venture with Dow Jones & Company (Dow Jones). The discussion and analysis that follow includes the financial results of Index Services beginning March 19, 2010.In June 2012, CBOT contributed certain assets and liabilities (DJI asset group) owned by Index Services to S&P/Dow Jones Indices LLC (S&P/DJI), a new business venture with The McGraw-Hill Companies Inc. (McGraw). In addition, Credit Market Analysis Ltd. (CMA) was sold to McGraw as part of this transaction. The discussion and analysis that follows excludes the assets and liabilities disposed as part of this transaction with McGraw beginning June 30, 2012. In November 2012, CBOT acquired The Board of Trade of Kansas City, Missouri, Inc. (KCBT), including its wholly-owned clearing house, Kansas City Board of Trade Clearing Corporation (KCBTCC) and its 51% controlling interest in Board of Trade Investment Company (BOTIC). The discussion and analysis that follows includes the financial results of KCBT beginning November 30, 2012.References in this discussion and analysis to “we” and “our” are to CME Group Inc. (CME Group) and its consolidated subsidiaries, collectively. References to “exchange” are to Chicago Mercantile Exchange Inc. (CME), CBOT and New York Mercantile Exchange, Inc. (NYMEX), Commodity Exchange, Inc. (COMEX) and KCBT, collectively, unless otherwise noted. OVERVIEWBusiness OverviewCME Group, a Delaware stock corporation, is the holding company for CME, CBOT, NYMEX and their respective subsidiaries as well as CME Clearing Europe Limited (CMECE). The holding company structure is designed to provide strategic and operational flexibility. CME Group's Class A common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market (NASDAQ) under the ticker symbol “CME.” Our exchange consists of designated contract markets for the trading of futures and options on futures contracts. We also clear futures, options on futures and over-the-counter contracts through our three designated clearing organizations: CME Clearing, which is a division of CME, KCBTCC and CMECE. Futures contracts and options on futures contracts provide investors with vehicles for protecting against, and potentially profiting from, price changes in financial instruments and physical commodities. We are a global exchange with customer access available virtually all over the world. Our customers consist of professional traders, financial institutions, individual and institutional investors, major corporations, manufacturers, producers and governments. Customers include both members of the exchange and non-members. We offer our customers the opportunity to trade futures contracts and options on futures contracts on a range of products including those based on interest rates, equities, foreign exchange, agricultural commodities, energy, and metals. We also clear over-the-counter contracts on a range of product lines including interest rate swaps, credit default swaps, foreign exchange, energy and agricultural commodities. Our products provide a means for hedging, speculating and allocating assets. We identify new products by monitoring economic trends and their impact on the risk management and speculative needs of our existing and prospective customers. 35Table of ContentsOur major product lines are traded through our electronic trading platform and our open outcry trading floors. These execution facilities offer our customers immediate trade execution and price transparency. In addition, trades can be executed through privately negotiated transactions that are cleared and settled through our CME and CMECE clearing houses. Our clearing houses clear, settle and guarantee every futures and options contract traded through our exchanges, in addition to cleared over-the-counter products. Our clearing house performance guarantee is an important function of our business. Because of this guarantee, our customers do not need to evaluate the credit of each potential counterparty or limit themselves to a selected set of counterparties. This flexibility increases the potential liquidity available for each trade. Additionally, the substitution of our clearing houses as the counterparty to every transaction allows our customers to establish a position with one party and offset the position with another party. This contract offsetting process provides our customers with flexibility in establishing and adjusting positions and provides for collateral and margining efficiencies. Business TrendsEconomic Environment. Our customers continue to use our markets as an effective and transparent means to manage risk and meet their investment needs despite recent economic uncertainty and volatility. In recent years, trading activity in our centralized markets has fluctuated due to the ongoing uncertainty in the financial markets caused by the United States and European credit crises, fluctuations in the availability of credit, variations in the amount of assets under management as well as the Federal Reserve Bank’s continued zero interest rate policy. We continue to maintain high quality and diverse products as well as various clearing and market data services which support our customers in any economic environment. Competitive Environment. Our industry is highly competitive and we continue to encounter competition in all aspects of our business. We expect competition to continue to intensify, especially in light of recent regulatory reforms in the financial services industry. Competition is influenced by liquidity and transparency of the markets, variability in fee structures, breadth of product offerings including quality of new product development as well as efficient and innovative technology. We now face competition from other futures, securities and securities option exchanges; over-the-counter markets; clearing organizations; consortia formed by our members and large market participants; alternative trade execution facilities; technology firms, including market data distributors and electronic trading system developers, and others. As the market continues to evolve, we have worked to adapt our trading technology and clearing services to meet the needs of our customers. Regulatory Environment. Exchange-traded derivatives have historically been subject to extensive regulation. As a result of the widespread difficulties across the economy over recent years, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank) was signed into law in July 2010. Dodd-Frank is a comprehensive banking and financial services reform package that includes significant changes to the oversight of the derivatives markets, both over-the-counter and exchange-traded. While we believe that the new regulations will provide opportunities for our business, the new regulations remain subject to additional rulemaking by various regulators. To the extent the regulatory environment following the implementation of the new legislation and other financial reform regulations is less beneficial for us or our customers, our business, financial condition and operating results could be negatively impacted. We continue to actively participate in the rulemaking process with the goal that the final regulations serve the public interest, foster competition and innovation and do not place the U.S. financial services sector at a competitive disadvantage. Pursuant to Dodd-Frank, in July 2012, the Financial Stability Oversight Council has designated CME as a systemically important financial market utility because it is operating as a U.S. clearing house. This designation creates additional regulatory oversight over our risk-management standards, clearing, and settlement activities. As a global company with operations and locations around the world, we are also subject to laws and regulations in foreign locations where we do business. The financial services industry in Europe is also undergoing similar regulatory reform, which could result in additional regulation over our European operations. Business StrategyOur strategy focuses on leveraging our benchmark products, enhancing our customer relations, expanding our customer base, advancing our clearing and trading technologies, and deriving benefits from our integrated clearing houses as well as our scalable infrastructure. We focus specifically on opportunities created by increased market awareness and acceptance of derivatives, increased price volatility, technological advances and the increasing need for counterparty risk mitigation and clearing services. This strategy allows us to continue to develop into a more broadly diversified financial exchange that provides trading and clearing solutions across a wide range of products and asset classes. We believe that we can build on our competitive strengths by executing on the following initiatives:•Grow our core business by launching new products, expanding our existing benchmark product lines as well as improving our customer relations in order to cross-sell our products;36Table of Contents•Globalize our business by expanding our presence in Europe as well as diversifying our worldwide customer base through strategic investments and relationships with other key exchanges and intermediaries around the world, including Asia, Latin America and other emerging markets, which allows us to accelerate our market penetration and improve product sales channels;•Expand our existing customer base and enhance our products and services offerings by targeting cross asset sales, driving international sales and generating new client participation across the world;•Offer a comprehensive multi-asset class clearing solution to the over-the-counter market that maximizes operational efficiency, as well as expand our over-the-counter product offerings and clearing services;•Establish ourselves as the leading exchange provider of information products and index services, which will allow us to create additional cross-listing opportunities and new opportunities for index creation. It will also allow us to create opportunities for licensing across global markets as well as expanding market data dissemination services to our global network of clients and exchange partners; andRevenuesClearing and transaction fees. A majority of our revenue is derived from clearing and transaction fees, which include electronic trading fees, surcharges for privately-negotiated transactions and other volume-related charges for contracts executed through our trading venues. Because clearing and transaction fees are assessed on a per-contract basis, revenues and profitability fluctuate with changes in contract volume. In addition to the business trends noted earlier, our contract volume, and consequently our revenues, tend to increase during periods of economic and geopolitical uncertainty as our customers seek to manage their exposure to, or speculate on, the market volatility resulting from uncertainty. While volume has the most significant impact on our clearing and transaction fees revenue, there are four other factors that also influence this source of revenues: •rate structure;•product mix;•venue, and•the percentage of trades executed by customers who are members compared with non-member customers.Rate structure. Customers benefit from volume discounts and limits on fees as part of our effort to increase liquidity in certain products. We offer various incentive programs to promote trading in various products and geographic locations. We may periodically change fees, volume discounts, limits on fees, and member discounts, perhaps significantly, based on our review of operations and the business environment. Product mix. We offer trading of futures and options on futures contracts as well as cleared-only swap contracts on a wide-ranging set of products based on interest rates, equities, foreign exchange, agricultural commodities, energy and metals. Rates are varied by product in order to optimize revenue on existing products and to encourage contract volume upon introduction of new products. Venue. Our exchange is an international marketplace that brings together buyers and sellers mainly through our electronic trading and clearing platforms as well as through open outcry trading on our trading floors and privately negotiated transactions. Any customer who is guaranteed by a clearing firm and who agrees to be bound by our exchange rules is able to obtain direct access to our electronic platforms. Open outcry trading is conducted exclusively by our members, who may execute trades on behalf of customers or for themselves. Typically, customers submitting trades through our electronic platforms are charged fees for using the platforms in addition to the fees assessed on all transactions executed on our exchange. Customers entering into privately negotiated transactions also incur additional charges beyond the fees assessed on other transactions. Privately negotiated transactions include block trades, which are large transactions that are executed between selected parties off the public auction market on CME Globex or the trading floor.Member/non-member mix. Generally, member customers are charged lower fees than our non-member customers. Holding all other factors constant, revenue decreases if the percentage of trades executed by members increases, and increases if the percentage of non-member trades increases. Other sources. Revenue is also derived from other sources including market data and information services, access and communication fees and various services related to our exchange and building operations. 37Table of ContentsMarket data and information services. We receive market data and information services revenue from the dissemination of our market data to subscribers. Subscribers can obtain access to our market data services either directly or through third-party distributors. Our service offerings include access to real-time, delayed and end-of-day quotations, trade and summary market data for our products and other data sources. Users of our basic service receive real-time quotes and pay a flat monthly fee for each screen, or device, displaying our market data. Alternatively, customers can subscribe to market data provided on a limited group of products. The fee for this service is also a flat rate per month.Pricing for our market data services is based on the value of the service provided, our cost structure for the service and the price of comparable services offered by our competitors. Increases or decreases in our market data and information services revenue are influenced by changes in our price structure for existing market data offerings, introduction of new market data services and changes in the number of devices in use. General economic factors that affect the financial services industry, which constitutes our primary customer base, also influence revenue from our market data services. Access and communication fees. Access and communication fees are the connectivity charges to customers of the CME Globex platform, to our market data vendors and to direct market data customers as well as charges to members and clearing firms that utilize our various telecommunications networks and communications services, including our co-location initiative, which was launched in January 2012. Access fee revenue varies depending on the type of connection provided to customers. Revenue from communication fees is dependent on open outcry trading, as a portion relates to telecommunications on our trading floors. Other revenues. To further diversify the range of services we offer, we have entered into processing and development agreements with other exchanges and service organizations. For example, we have an agreement with BM&FBOVESPA S.A (BM&FBOVESPA) to develop a new multi-asset class electronic trading platform for their customers. We recognize revenue under this agreement as services are provided and when developed technology is delivered. Additionally, other revenues include fees for administrating our Interest Earning Facility (IEF) program, trade order routing, and various services to members and clearing firms. We offer clearing firms the opportunity to invest cash performance bonds in our various IEF offerings. These clearing firms receive interest income, and we receive a fee based on total funds on deposit. In addition, other revenues include trading gains and losses generated by GFX Corporation (GFX), our wholly-owned subsidiary that trades futures contracts to enhance liquidity in our electronic markets for these products. Other revenues also include gains on sales from various operating assets.Other revenues also include rent charged to third party tenants as well as ancillary charges for utilities, parking and miscellaneous services provided to tenants.ExpensesThe majority of our expenses do not vary directly with changes in our contract volume. Licensing and other fee agreements and the majority of our employee bonuses do vary directly with contract volume. Compensation and benefits. Compensation and benefits expense is our most significant expense and includes employee wages, bonuses, stock-based compensation, benefits and employer taxes. Changes in this expense are driven by fluctuations in the number of employees, increases in wages as a result of inflation or labor market conditions, changes in rates for employer taxes and other cost increases affecting benefit plans. In addition, this expense is affected by the composition of our work force. The expense associated with our bonus and stock-based compensation plans can also have a significant impact on this expense category and may vary from year to year. The bonus component of our compensation and benefits expense is based on our financial performance. Under the performance criteria of our annual incentive plans, the bonus funded under the plans is based on achieving certain financial performance targets established by the compensation committee of our board of directors. The compensation committee may adjust the target level of performance for material, unplanned operating results or capital expenditures to meet intermediate to long-term growth opportunities. Stock-based compensation is a non-cash expense related to stock options, restricted stock and performance share grants. Stock-based compensation varies depending on the quantity and fair value of awards granted. The fair value of options is derived using the Black-Scholes model with assumptions about our dividend yield, the expected volatility of our stock price based on an analysis of implied and historical volatility, the risk-free interest rate and the expected life of the options granted. The fair value of other awards is based on either the share price on the date of the grant or a model of expected future stock prices. Professional fees and outside services. This expense includes fees for consulting services received on strategic and technology initiatives, temporary labor as well as legal and accounting fees. This expense may fluctuate as a result of changes in services required to complete initiatives and legal proceedings.38Table of ContentsAmortization of purchased intangibles. This expense includes amortization of intangible assets obtained in our mergers with CBOT Holdings, Inc. and NYMEX Holdings, Inc. as well as other asset and business acquisitions. Intangible assets subject to amortization consist primarily of clearing firm, market data and other customer relationships. Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense results from the depreciation of long-lived assets such as buildings, leasehold improvements, furniture, fixtures and equipment. This expense also includes the amortization of purchased and internally developed software. Other expenses. We incur additional ongoing expenses for communications, technology support services and various other activities necessary to support our operations. •Communications expense includes costs for network connections for our electronic platforms and some market data customers; telecommunications costs of our exchange; and fees paid for access to external market data. This expense may be impacted by growth in electronic contract volume, our capacity requirements and changes in the number of telecommunications hubs and connections which allow customers outside the United States to access our electronic platforms directly. •Technology support services consist of costs related to maintenance of the hardware and software required to support our technology. Our technology support services costs are driven by system capacity, functionality and redundancy requirements. •Occupancy and building operations expense consists of costs related to leased and owned property including rent, maintenance, real estate taxes, utilities and other related costs. We have significant operations located in Chicago and New York City with smaller offices located throughout the world. Additionally, we have trading facilities in Chicago, New York City and Kansas City as well as data centers in various U.S. locations. •Licensing and other fee agreements expense includes license fees paid as a result of contract volume in equity index products, and royalty and broker rebates on energy and metals products. This expense fluctuates with changes in contract volumes as well as changes in fee structures. •Other expenses include marketing and travel-related expenses as well as general and administrative costs. Marketing, advertising and public relations expense includes media, print and other advertising costs, as well as costs associated with our product promotion. Other expenses also include litigation and customer settlements, impairment charges on operational assets and foreign currency transaction gains and losses resulting from changes in exchange rates on certain foreign deposits.Non-Operating Income and ExpensesIncome and expenses incurred through activities outside of our core operations are considered non-operating. These activities include non-core investing and financing activities. •Investment income includes dividend income from our strategic equity investments; gains and losses on trading securities in our non-qualified deferred compensation plans; short-term investment of excess cash, clearing firms' cash performance bonds and guaranty fund contributions; and interest income and realized gains and losses from our marketable securities. Investment income is influenced by the amount of dividends distributed by our strategic investments, the availability of funds generated by operations; market interest rates, and changes in the levels of cash performance bonds deposited by clearing firms. •We use derivative financial instruments for the purpose of hedging exposures to fluctuations in interest rates. Any ineffective or excluded portion of our hedges is recognized in earnings immediately. •Interest and other borrowing costs are associated with various short-term and long-term funding facilities. We also maintain a commercial paper program with various financial institutions.•Equity in net gains (losses) of unconsolidated subsidiaries includes income and losses from our investments in S&P/Dow Jones Indices LLC, Dubai Mercantile Exchange and Bursa Malaysia Derivatives Berhad.•Other income (expense) includes the net gain related to the contribution of the DJI asset group and the sale of CMA as well as gains related to our former securities lending program. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIESThe notes to our consolidated financial statements include disclosure of our significant accounting policies. In establishing these policies within the framework of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, management must make certain assessments, estimates and choices that will result in the application of these principles in a manner that appropriately reflects our financial condition and results of operations. Critical accounting policies are those policies that we believe present the most complex or subjective measurements and have the most potential to affect our financial position and operating results. While all decisions regarding accounting policies are important, there are certain accounting policies that we consider to be 39Table of Contentscritical. These critical policies, which are presented in detail in the notes to our consolidated financial statements, relate to the valuation of financial instruments, goodwill and intangible assets, revenue recognition, income taxes, and internal use software costs. Valuation of financial instruments. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, or an exit price. We have categorized financial instruments measured at fair value into the following three-level fair value hierarchy based upon the level of judgment associated with the inputs used to measure the fair value: •Level 1—Inputs are unadjusted, quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date. Assets and liabilities carried at level 1 fair value generally include U.S. Treasury securities, equity securities listed in active markets, and investments in publicly traded mutual funds with quoted market prices.•Level 2—Inputs are either directly or indirectly observable and corroborated by market data or are based on quoted prices in markets that are not active. Assets and liabilities carried at level 2 fair value generally include municipal bonds, asset-backed securities, U.S. government agency securities and certain derivatives.•Level 3—Inputs are unobservable and reflect management’s best estimate of what market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. Generally assets and liabilities at fair value utilizing level 3 inputs include certain other assets and liabilities with inputs that require management’s judgment.For further discussion regarding the fair value of financial assets and liabilities, see note 19 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Goodwill and intangible assets. We review goodwill for impairment on an annual basis and whenever events or circumstances indicate that its carrying value may not be recoverable. Goodwill may be tested quantitatively for impairment by comparing the carrying value of a reporting unit to its estimated fair value. Estimating the fair value of a reporting unit involves the use of valuation techniques that rely on significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions may include forecasted revenue growth rates; forecasted operating margins; risk-adjusted discount rates; forecasted economic and market conditions, and industry multiples. We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable given the information that is available to us at the time of our assessment; however, actual future results may differ significantly from those estimates. Under certain favorable circumstances, goodwill may be reviewed qualitatively for indications of impairment without utilizing valuation techniques to estimate fair value. The qualitative assessment of goodwill relies on significant assumptions about forecasts of revenue growth, operating margins and economic conditions as well as overall market and industry-specific trends. We also review indefinite-lived intangible assets on an annual basis or more frequently when events and circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable. Indefinite-lived intangible assets may be tested quantitatively for impairment by comparing their carrying values to their estimated fair values. Estimating the fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets involves the use of valuation techniques that rely on significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions may include forecasted revenue growth rates; forecasted allocations of expense, and risk-adjusted discount rates. We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable given the information that is available to us at the time of our assessment; however, actual future results may differ significantly from those estimates. Similar to goodwill, under certain favorable circumstances, indefinite-lived intangible assets may be reviewed qualitatively for indications of impairment without utilizing valuation techniques to estimate fair value. The qualitative assessment of indefinite-lived intangibles assets relies on significant assumptions about forecasts of revenue growth, operating margins and economic conditions as well as overall market and industry-specific trends.Intangible assets subject to amortization are also assessed for impairment when indicated by a change in economic or operational circumstances. The impairment assessment of these assets requires management to first compare the book value of the amortizing asset to undiscounted cash flows. If the book value exceeds the undiscounted cash flows, management is then required to estimate the fair value of the assets and record an impairment loss for the excess of the carrying value over the fair value. Revenue recognition. A significant portion of our revenue is derived from the clearing and transaction fees we assess on each contract executed through our trading venues and cleared through our clearing houses. Clearing and transaction fees are recognized as revenue when a buy and sell order are matched and when the trade is cleared. On occasion, the customer's exchange trading privileges may not be properly entered by the clearing firm and incorrect fees are charged for the transactions in the affected accounts. When this information is corrected within the time period allowed by the exchange, a fee adjustment is provided to the clearing firm. An accrual is established for estimated fee adjustments to reflect corrections to customer exchange trading privileges. The accrual is based on the historical pattern of adjustments processed as well as specific adjustment requests.40Table of ContentsIncome taxes. Calculation of the income tax provision includes an estimate of the income taxes that will be paid for the current year as well as an estimate of income tax liabilities or benefits deferred into future years. Deferred tax assets are reviewed to determine if they will be realized in future periods. To the extent it is determined that some deferred tax assets may not be fully realized, the assets are reduced to their realizable value by a valuation allowance. The calculation of our tax provision involves uncertainty in the application of complex tax regulations. We recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the United States and other applicable foreign tax jurisdictions using a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold based on the technical merits of the tax position taken or expected to be taken. If payment of these amounts varies from our estimate, our income tax provision would be reduced or increased at the time that determination is made. This determination may not be known for several years. Past tax audits have not resulted in tax adjustments that would result in a material change to the income tax provision in the year the audit was completed. The effective tax rate, defined as the income tax provision as a percentage of income before income taxes, will vary from year to year based on changes in tax jurisdictions, tax rates and regulations. In addition, the effective tax rate will vary with changes to income that are not subject to income tax, such as municipal interest income, and changes in expenses or losses that are not deductible, such as the utilization of foreign net operating losses. Internal use software costs. Certain internal and external costs that are incurred in connection with developing or obtaining computer software for internal use are capitalized. Software development costs incurred during the planning or maintenance project stages are expensed as incurred, while costs incurred during the application development stage are capitalized and are amortized over the estimated useful life of the software, generally three years. Amortization of capitalized costs begins only when the software becomes ready for its intended use.RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTSIn December 2011 and January 2013, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued updates to existing rules over balance sheet offsetting disclosure. The updates require entities to disclose both gross and net information about certain financial instruments eligible for offset in the balance sheet. Financial instruments may include derivatives, repurchase agreements and securities lending transactions. The objective of these disclosures is to facilitate comparison between those entities that prepare their financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and those entities that prepare their financial statements using International Financial Reporting Standards. The updates are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2013, and interim periods therein, with retrospective application required for comparability purposes. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS2012 Financial HighlightsThe comparability of our operating results for the periods presented may be impacted by mergers, acquisitions and disposals of businesses and/or asset groups. Where material, these impacts are discussed in the analysis that follows.The following summarizes significant changes in our financial performance for the years presented. Year-over-Year Change(dollars in millions, except per share data) 2012 2011 2010 2012-2011 2011-2010Total revenues $2,914.6 $3,280.6 $3,003.7 (11)% 9 %Total expenses 1,222.6 1,259.5 1,172.6 (3) 7Operating margin 58% 62% 61% Non-operating income (expense) $1.4 $(84.6) $(109.2) (102) (22)Effective tax rate 46% 6% 45% Net income attributable to CME Group $896.3 $1,812.3 $951.4 (51) 90Diluted earnings per common share attributable to CME Group 2.70 5.43 2.86 (50) 90Cash flows from operating activities 1,216.8 1,346.3 1,359.6 (10) (1)•In 2012 when compared with 2011, the decrease in total revenues was attributable to lower contract volume and a decrease in market data and information services revenue as a result of the contribution of the DJI asset group. Higher contract volume as well as market data and information services revenue contributed to an increase in revenues in 2011 when compared with 2010. •In 2011, we recognized expenses related to the MF Global bankruptcy, resulting in a decrease in expenses in 2012 when compared with 2011 and an increase in 2011 when compared with 2010. Higher compensation and benefits 41Table of Contentsexpense partially offset the decrease in operating expenses in 2012 when compared with 2011 and contributed to an increase in expenses in 2011 when compared with 2010. In 2010, we also recognized impairment charges on the goodwill and trade name related to our CMA operations. •Non-operating income increased from 2011 to 2012 primarily as a result of the net gain from the contribution of the DJI asset group to S&P/DJI and the sale of CMA. In addition, we began recognizing our proportionate share of net income from our venture with McGraw in July 2012. The decrease in non-operating expense in 2011 compared with 2010 was attributable to lower interest expense resulting from the repayment of the $420.5 million term loan in January 2011 and the maturity of the $300.0 million floating rate notes in August 2010.•In 2011, we reduced our income tax provision due to a revaluation of our deferred tax liabilities resulting from a change in state tax apportionment. This revaluation contributed to an increase in the effective tax rate in 2012 when compared with 2011 and a decrease in the effective tax rate in 2011 when compared with 2010. The increase in the effective tax rate in 2012 when compared with 2011 was also due to the establishment of deferred tax liabilities associated with S&P/DJI. Revenues Year-over-Year Change(dollars in millions) 2012 2011 2010 2012-2011 2011-2010Clearing and transaction fees $2,371.5 $2,710.9 $2,486.3 (13)% 9%Market data and information services 387.1 427.7 395.1 (9) 8Access and communication fees 88.8 49.2 45.4 80 8Other 67.2 92.8 76.9 (28) 21Total Revenues $2,914.6 $3,280.6 $3,003.7 (11) 9Clearing and Transaction FeesThe following table summarizes our total contract volume, revenue and average rate per contract. Total contract volume includes contracts that are traded on our exchange and cleared through our clearing houses. Contract volume also includes certain cleared-only contracts. Volume is measured in round turns, which is considered a completed transaction that involves a purchase and an offsetting sale of a contract. Average rate per contract is determined by dividing total clearing and transaction fees by total contract volume. All amounts exclude our credit default swap, interest rate swap, TRAKRS and CME Clearing Europe contracts. The following table also excludes volume from KCBT from December 1, 2012 through December 31, 2012.

Year-over-Year Change(in millions) 2012-2011 2011-2010Increase (decrease) due to change in total contract volume $(406.6) $247.0Increase (decrease) due to change in average rate per contract 61.4 (22.4)Net increase (decrease) in clearing and transaction fees $(345.2) $224.6Average rate per contract is impacted by our rate structure, including volume-based incentives; product mix; trading venue, and the percentage of volume executed by customers who are members compared with non-member customers. Due to the relationship between average rate per contract and contract volume, the change in clearing and transaction fees attributable to changes in each is only an approximation.42Table of ContentsContract VolumeThe following table summarizes average daily contract volume. Contract volume can be influenced by many factors, including political and economic factors, the regulatory environment and market competition.

The average daily volume for KCBT's agricultural commodity contracts was 16,100 during December 2012.Interest Rate ProductsThe following table summarizes average daily volume for our key interest rate products. Eurodollar front 8 contracts include contracts expiring within two years. Eurodollar back 32 contracts include contracts expiring within three to ten years. Year-over-Year Change(amounts in thousands) 2012 2011 2010 2012-2011 2011-2010Eurodollar futures and options: Front 8 futures 1,099 1,717 1,646 (36)% 4%Back 32 futures 579 510 357 13 43Options 410 767 726 (47) 6U.S. Treasury futures and options: 10-Year 1,255 1,454 1,380 (14) 55-Year 567 720 546 (21) 32Treasury bond 427 415 388 3 72-Year 230 297 274 (22) 8Overall interest rate contract volume decreased in 2012 when compared with 2011 due to low interest rate volatility as a result of the Federal Reserve's continued intent to maintain its zero interest rate policy through mid-2015. In 2012 when compared with 2011, the increase in volume in the long-term interest rate products, including the Eurodollar back 32 futures and the Treasury bond futures and options contracts was attributable to periods of higher long-term interest rate volatility in early 2012. The Federal Reserve's announcement in January 2012 to extend its zero interest rate policy shifted market expectations regarding long-term interest rates, which resulted in periods of higher volatility in early 2012.In 2011 when compared with 2010, the overall increase in interest rate contract volume was attributable to volatility caused by a change in market expectations regarding short-term and long-term interest rates tied to the Federal Reserve's announcement in 2011 that it intended to maintain its zero interest rate policy through 2013. In addition, volatility caused by the downgrade of the United States credit rating in August 2011 also contributed to an increase in overall volume. Mid-term interest rate contract volume, which includes Eurodollar back 32 futures and 5-year U.S. Treasury futures and options, grew at a faster rate than 43Table of Contentsshort-term contract volume because of a shift from contracts based on short-term interest rates to mid-term interest rates due to the continued zero interest rate policy.We also believe that overall U.S. Treasury futures and options contract volume increased in 2011 when compared with 2010 due to institutional portfolio adjustments caused by the downgrade of the United States credit rating. Many institutional portfolios are required to maintain an average minimum overall credit rating. When the U.S. Treasury credit rating was downgraded, the institutional portfolios had to sell investments with lower credit ratings and buy more U.S. Treasuries in order to increase their average minimum overall credit rating. In addition, the growth in overall U.S. Treasury futures and options contract volume was attributable to increased demand for U.S. Treasury securities as a safe haven investment during the European credit crisis.Equity ProductsThe following table summarizes average daily volume for our key equity products. Year-over-Year Change(amounts in thousands) 2012 2011 2010 2012-2011 2011-2010E-mini S&P 500 futures and options 2,016 2,605 2,285 (23)% 14 %E-mini NASDAQ 100 futures and options 254 301 317 (16) (5)The decrease in equity contract volume in 2012 when compared with 2011 was due to a decline in equity market volatility, as measured by the CBOE Volatility Index. The decline in volatility was the result of few new developments in the macroeconomic environment within the United States and European markets. We believe a decline in assets under management also contributed to a decrease in volume in 2012 when compared with 2011. In 2011 when compared with 2010, an overall increase in volatility contributed to higher equity contract volume. We believe the periods of high volatility within the equity markets during the third quarter of 2011were attributable to the downgrade of the United States credit rating and the continuation of the sovereign debt crisis in Europe. In general, equity products such as the E-mini NASDAQ contracts that hedge market risks different than those of the E-mini S&P 500, our most liquid equity product, do not tend to benefit from macro-level events or increased volatility to the same extent.Foreign Exchange ProductsThe following table summarizes average daily volume for our key foreign exchange products. Year-over-Year Change(amounts in thousands) 2012 2011 2010 2012-2011 2011-2010Euro 290 357 367 (19)% (3)%Australian dollar 134 126 105 7 20British pound 106 118 124 (10) (5)Japanese yen 99 118 131 (16) (10)Canadian dollar 93 92 91 1 1The overall decrease in foreign exchange contract volume in 2012 when compared with 2011 was attributable primarily to the decline in euro contract volume. We believe trading activity in euro contracts was impacted by the lack of a directional trend due to uncertainty related to the health of the European Union and concern regarding additional economic stimulus provided by the Federal Reserve. The lack of a trend has reduced trading in euro contracts among customers who trade based on medium- to long-term expectations. We believe th uncertainty with the European Union also contributed to a decline in British pound contract volume in 2012 when compared with 2011 because the British economy is closely tied to the European Union. We believe that intervention by the Japanese central bank to control the yen foreign exchange rate beginning in mid-2011 through 2012 caused market participants to reduce their trading in Japanese yen contracts and to focus on higher yielding currencies, such as the Australian and Canadian dollars.In 2011 when compared with 2010, foreign exchange contract volume remained at a consistent level. We believe that intervention by the Japanese central bank to control the yen foreign exchange rate and uncertainty about the Euro as a result of the European sovereign debt crisis caused the market to move to safe haven currencies, such as the Australian dollar and the Canadian dollar. As a result, Euro and Japanese yen contract volume decreased while Australian dollar volume increased.44Table of ContentsAgricultural Commodity ProductsThe following table summarizes average daily volume for our key agricultural commodity products. Year-over-Year Change(amounts in thousands) 2012 2011 2010 2012-2011 2011-2010Corn 392 426 358 (8)% 19%Soybean 278 232 186 20 25Wheat (1) 129 115 109 12 5Soybean Oil 118 105 89 12 18(1) Wheat contract volume does not include volume for KCBT's hard red winter wheat products. The average daily volume for KCBT's agricultural commodity contracts was 16,100 during December 2012.The increase in agricultural commodity contract volume in 2012 when compared with 2011 was attributable to higher volatility resulting from severe drought conditions in the Midwest in the second and third quarters of 2012. We believe the increased volatility was the result of supply constraint concerns for soybean and wheat supplies. Corn volumes declined slightly in 2012 when compared with 2011. Early market expectations of excess supply in 2012 dampened corn price volatility in early 2012, which resulted in the decline in volume.We believe that the increase in contract volume in 2011 when compared with 2010 was attributable to a decline in supply due to various weather events including flooding, drought and excessive heat. The change in supply resulted in increased volatility and higher grain prices. We also believe that the increase in volume resulted from increased demand for feedgrains caused by higher demand for cattle and other proteins in emerging markets.Energy ProductsThe following table summarizes average daily volume for our key energy products. Year-over-Year Change(amounts in thousands) 2012 2011 2010 2012-2011 2011-2010Crude oil 729 900 853 (19)% 5%Natural gas 600 533 489 12 9Refined products 314 275 244 14 13Energy contract volume decreased slightly in 2012 when compared with 2011. A decline in crude oil contract volume resulting from lower price volatility contributed to an overall decrease in energy products volume. Political unrest in the Middle East in the first quarter of 2011 resulted in changes in global supply, which contributed to higher price volatility in early 2011 relative to 2012. Additionally, lower crude oil contract volume in 2012 was partially attributable to oversupply in Cushing, Oklahoma. We believe that the reversal of the Seaway Pipeline in the second quarter of 2012, and ongoing capacity increases in the pipeline, will continue to relieve oversupply and provide needed infrastructure for ongoing expected North American crude oil supply increases. However, uncertainty remains over the timing and extent of the impact the reversal will have on the overall crude oil market. The decrease in crude oil contract volume was partially offset by an increase in natural gas contract volume. The increase in natural gas contract volume resulted largely from volatility around production shifts in the early part of 2012. Refined products growth is due to increased volatility caused by a growing US export market as global oil markets adapt to increased supply of North American crude oil, despite refinery shutdowns.In 2011 when compared with 2010, we believe the increase in energy contract volume was attributable to increased price volatility within the energy market during the first quarter of 2011. We also believe that increased volatility caused by weather-related events led to an increase in natural gas contract volume in 2011.45Table of ContentsMetal ProductsThe following table summarizes average daily volume for our key metal products. Year-over-Year Change(amounts in thousands) 2012 2011 2010 2012-2011 2011-2010Gold 212 238 208 (11)% 14%Copper 64 50 41 29 22Silver 60 87 57 (31) 51The overall decrease in metal products volume in 2012 when compared with 2011 was due to lower volatility in the precious metals markets in 2012 when compared with 2011. We believe the August 2011 announcement of the Federal Reserve's intent to maintain its zero interest rate policy and deepening Eurozone worries, which caused high volatility within other financial markets in 2011, resulted in an increased interest in precious metals as an asset class. This increased interest in 2011 resulted in relative decreases in gold and silver contract volume in 2012 when compared with 2011. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in volume for copper contracts as a result of economic growth in Asia as well as global supply constraints.The overall increase in metal contract volume in 2011 when compared with 2010 was attributable to the increased investment in precious metals as an asset class due to high volatility and uncertainty within the financial markets. We believe that there was an increase in silver contract volume due to the greater use of silver as an alternative investment.Average Rate per ContractThe average rate per contract increased in 2012 when compared with 2011 due to a shift in the relative mix of product volume. In 2012, agricultural commodity and energy product volumes, when measured as a percentage of total volume, each increased by 2% while interest rate and equity product volumes decreased by 3% and 2%, respectively. Agricultural commodity and energy products have higher fees compared with interest rate products and equity products.In 2011 when compared with 2010, the average rate per contract decreased due to an increase in member contract volume, which increased faster than non-member trading. In general, members receive lower rates when compared with non-members. Concentration of RevenueWe bill a substantial portion of our clearing and transaction fees to our clearing firms. The majority of clearing and transaction fees received from clearing firms represent charges for trades executed and cleared on behalf of their customers. Two firms each represented 12% of our clearing and transaction fees revenue in 2012. One firm represented 12% of our clearing and transaction fees revenue in 2011. One firm represented 13% and one firm represented 12% of our clearing and transaction fees revenue in 2010. Should a clearing firm withdraw, we believe that the customer portion of the firm's trading activity would likely transfer to another clearing firm of the exchange. Therefore, we do not believe we are exposed to significant risk from an ongoing loss of revenue received from or through a particular clearing firm. Other Sources of RevenueMarket data and information services. The decline in market data and information services revenue in 2012 when compared with 2011 resulted from a $53.2 million decrease in market data and information services revenue from Index Services and CMA. In the second quarter of 2012, the DJI asset group, including assets which generated market data and information services revenue, was contributed to the McGraw venture and CMA was sold to McGraw. In addition, the decrease in revenue was due to a decline in the basic device count in 2012 due to cost-cutting initiatives at customer firms. The decrease in market data and information services was partially offset by an increase in our basic device service fee from $61 per month to $70 per month effective January 2012. Revenues from Index Services contributed to an increase in market data and information services revenue in 2011 when compared with 2010. In March 2010, we formed Index Services, which generated additional revenues of $35.6 million in 2011 when compared with 2010. In addition, revenues from Index Services increased in 2011 when compared with 2010 due to growth in assets under management, which was driven by underlying index market performance. The overall increase in 2011 when compared with 2010 was partially offset by a decline in revenue due to a decrease in basic device counts resulting from cost-cutting initiatives at customer firms.The two largest resellers of our market data represented, in aggregate, 43%, 39% and 45% of our market data and information services revenue in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Despite this concentration, we consider exposure to significant risk of revenue loss to be minimal. In the event that one of these vendors no longer subscribes to our market data, we believe the majority of that vendor's customers would likely subscribe to our market data through another reseller. Additionally, several of 46Table of Contentsour largest institutional customers that utilize services from our two largest resellers report usage and remit payment of their fees directly to us.Access and communication fees. Our co-location program contributed to an increase in access and communication fees revenue from 2010 through 2012. During the fourth quarter of 2011, we substantially completed installations of equipment for customers and launched our co-location services on January 29, 2012. We generated incremental revenue of $47.8 million in 2012 when compared with 2011 and incremental revenue of $3.4 million in 2011 when compared with 2010. Other revenue. In 2012 when compared with 2011, the decrease in other revenue was largely due to a decline in rental income of $13.1 million resulting from the sale of the CBOT buildings in Chicago. In the second quarter of 2011, we recognized a $9.8 million gain on the sale of certain Index Services assets related to one of its service offerings, which contributed to a decrease in other revenues in 2012 when compared with 2011. The initial phase to develop a new multi-asset class electronic platform for BM&FBOVESPA was completed in the third quarter of 2011, which also resulted in a decrease in other revenues in 2012. The decrease in other revenues in 2012 when compared with 2011 was partially offset by additional processing services revenue from various strategic relationships.In 2011 when compared with 2010, the increase in other revenues was largely attributable to the $9.8 million gain on the sale of certain Index Services assets and additional processing services revenue. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in revenues resulting from our platform development for BM&FBOVESPA.

The increase was partially offset by a decrease in average headcount as a result of the contribution of the DJI asset group to the McGraw venture and the sale of CMA in the second quarter of 2012.The increase in stock-based compensation expense was due to the accelerated vesting of stock-based compensation associated with our CEO transition in 2012 as well as the impact related to the September 2011 and 2012 grants. 47Table of ContentsAn increase in our non-qualified deferred compensation liability, the impact of which does not affect net income because of an equal and offsetting change in investment income, contributed to an increase in compensation and benefits expense. Bonus expense decreased due to performance relative to our 2012 cash earnings target when compared with 2011 performance relative to our 2011 cash earnings target.Amortization of purchased intangibles declined as a result of the contribution of the DJI asset group, the sale of CMA and the disposal of certain lease-related intangible assets in the second quarter of 2012. Overall expenses also decreased in 2012 when compared with 2011 due to the expenses incurred in 2011 as a result of the MF Global bankruptcy filing in the fourth quarter of 2011, which included write-offs of accounts receivable, legal fees and losses on collateral posted by GFX and held by MF Global in customer segregated funds as well as other related expenses. In 2012, we recognized a recovery on the losses incurred on collateral posted by GFX in 2011.2011 Compared With 2010Operating expenses increased by $86.9 million in 2011 when compared with 2010.

Marketing expenses increased in 2011 due primarily to new advertising initiatives.A decrease in professional fees in 2011 was attributable to the formation and integration of Index Services, which occurred in the first quarter of 2010.Impairment charges recorded in the second quarter of 2010 on the goodwill and trade name related to our CMA operations also contributed to a decrease in expenses in 2011 when compared with 2010.Non-Operating Income (Expense) Year-over-Year Change(dollars in millions) 2012 2011 2010 2012-2011 2011-2010Investment income $38.7 $36.7 $42.3 5 % (13)%Impairment of long-term investments — — (2.2) — (100)Gains (losses) on derivative investments (0.1) (0.1) (2.6) — (96)Interest and other borrowing costs (132.2) (116.9) (140.3) 13 (17)Equity in net gains (losses) of unconsolidated subsidiaries 30.7 (4.3) (6.4) n.m.

The increase in investment income during 2012 when compared with the same period in 2011 was attributable to an increase in gains on marketable securities related to our non-qualified deferred compensation plan of $5.7 million. Gains and losses from these non-qualified deferred compensation plan securities are offset by an equal amount of compensation and benefits expense. The increase in investment income was also attributable to other gains on investments. The increase in investment income was partially offset by a decrease in dividend income of $5.9 million in 2012 compared with the same period in 2011 due largely to a decrease in dividends from our investment in BM&FBOVESPA in 2012 when compared with 2011. The decrease in investment income during 2011 when compared with 2010 was due to a decline in gains on marketable securities related to our non-qualified deferred compensation plans of $4.1 million. In addition, we recognized a gain of $3.7 million from the sale of various equity and debt securities in 2010, which contributed to the decrease in investment income in 2011 when compared with 2010. The decrease in 2011 when compared with 2010 was partially offset by an increase in dividend income from our investment in BM&FBOVESPA. Total overall dividend income was $34.9 million in 2011 compared with $31.9 million in 2010. Gains (losses) on derivative investments. In 2010, we recognized an $8.6 million loss due to ineffectiveness on the interest rate swap contract used to hedge interest rate risk on our term loan. Both the swap contract and the term loan were originally scheduled to expire in August 2011. In December 2010, we approved a plan to refinance the term loan in January 2011 resulting in ineffectiveness of the hedge. Additionally, in March 2010, we recognized a $6.0 million gain on derivative investments as a result of a settlement from the Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (Lehman) bankruptcy proceedings. The settlement related to an unsecured claim against Lehman as counterparty to an over-the-counter put option contract we purchased to hedge our risk of changes in the fair value of BM&FBOVESPA stock resulting from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and the Brazilian real.Interest and other borrowing costs. The following table shows the weighted average borrowings outstanding, weighted average effective yield and average cost of borrowing for the periods presented: Year-over-Year Change(dollars in millions) 2012 2011 2010 2012-2011 2011-2010Weighted average borrowings outstanding $2,344.1 $2,155.8 $2,668.1 $188.3 $(512.3)Weighted average effective yield 5.06% 5.18% 4.96% (0.12)% 0.22%Average cost of borrowing (1) 5.66 5.47 5.24 0.19 0.23(1) Average cost of borrowing includes interest, the effective portion of interest rate hedges, commitment fees, discount accretion and debt issuance costs.On September 10, 2012, we issued $750.0 million of 3.0% fixed rate notes due September 2022, which contributed to the increase in the weighted average borrowings outstanding and decreases in weighted average effective yield. The average cost of borrowings increased in 2012 when compared with 2011 because of higher commitment fees on the 364-day fully secured, committed line of credit resulting from an increase in the commitment. Interest expense decreased in 2011 compared with 2010 due to repayment of the $420.5 million term loan in January 2011 and the maturity of the $300.0 million floating rate notes in August 2010. The decrease in 2011 compared with 2010 was partially offset by the issuance, in March 2010, of $612.5 million of 4.40% fixed rate notes, which are due in 2018. As a result, there was a decrease in weighted average borrowings and an increase in weighted average effective yield and average cost of borrowings in 2011 when compared with 2010.Equity in net gains (losses) of unconsolidated subsidiaries. In 2012, we recognized income from our investment in the McGraw venture, which contributed to increases in equity in net gains (losses) of unconsolidated subsidiaries in 2012 when compared with 2011.Other income (expense). In 2012, we recognized a net gain of $58.9 million related to the contribution of the DJI asset group and the sale of CMA. Additionally, in 2012, we recognized a gain of $5.7 million related to the recovery of a 2008 impairment loss on a corporate debt security held in the NYMEX securities lending portfolio.49Table of ContentsIncome Tax ProvisionThe following table summarizes the effective tax rate for the periods presented: 2012 2011 2010 Year-over-Year Change2012-2011 2011-2010Year ended December 3146.5% 6.3% 44.7% 40.2% (38.4)%In 2011, we reduced our income tax provision by $646.0 million due largely to a revaluation of our existing deferred tax liabilities resulting from a change in state tax apportionment. This revaluation contributed to an increase in the effective tax rate in 2012 when compared with 2011 and a decrease in the effective tax rate in 2011 when compared with 2010. In 2012, we established deferred income tax liabilities associated with the McGraw venture resulting in a $106.8 million increase in our income tax provision, which also contributed to a higher effective tax rate in 2012 when compared with 2011. Additionally, in the first quarter of 2011, we began marking to market our investment in BM&FBOVESPA which resulted in a $48.8 million reduction in valuation allowances on unrealized capital losses previously reserved, which also reduced our effective tax rate in 2011.LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESCash RequirementsWe have historically met our funding requirements with cash generated by our ongoing operations. While our cost structure is fixed in the short term, our sources of operating cash are dependent on contract volume levels. We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to cover our working capital needs, capital expenditures, and other commitments. However, it is possible that we may need to raise additional funds to finance our activities through issuances of commercial paper, future public debt offerings or by direct borrowings from financial institutions. Cash will also be required for operating leases and non-cancellable purchase obligations as well as other obligations reflected as long-term liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2012. These were as follows: (in millions) OperatingLeases PurchaseObligations OtherLong-TermLiabilities Total(1)Year 2013 $28.7 $16.6 $46.4 $91.72014-2015 58.0 17.7 — 75.72016-2017 58.2 1.5 — 59.7Thereafter 152.9 1.0 — 153.9Total $297.8 $36.8 $46.4 $381.0(1)Gross unrecognized income tax liabilities, including interest and penalties, of $57.8 million for uncertain tax positions are not included in the table due to uncertainty about the date of their settlement.Operating leases include rent payments for office space in Chicago and other smaller offices in the United States and in various foreign countries. The operating lease for our headquarters in Chicago expires in November 2022. Annual minimum rental payments under this lease range from $11.0 million to $13.5 million. We also maintain operating leases for additional office spaces in Chicago, which expire in November 2023 and April 2027. Annual minimum rental payments under these leases range from $4.8 million to $6.2 million and $2.9 million to $4.3 million, respectively. Purchase obligations include minimum payments due under agreements to purchase software licenses, hardware and maintenance as well as telecommunication services. Other long-term liabilities include funding obligations for other post-retirement benefit plans as well as contingent consideration. Future capital expenditures for technology are anticipated as we continue to support our growth through additional investment in our co-location program, increased system capacity and performance improvements. Each year, capital expenditures are incurred for improvements to and expansion of our offices, remote data centers, telecommunications network and other operating equipment. In 2013, we expect capital expenditures to total between $140.0 million and $150.0 million. We continue to monitor our capital needs and may revise our forecasted expenditures as necessary in the future. 50Table of ContentsWe intend to continue to pay a regular quarterly dividend to our shareholders. The decision to pay a dividend, however, remains within the discretion of our board of directors and may be affected by various factors, including our earnings, financial condition, capital requirements, levels of indebtedness and other considerations our board of directors deems relevant. CME Group is also required to comply with restrictions contained in the general corporation laws of its state of incorporation, which could also limit its ability to declare and pay dividends. The distribution target under our annual dividend policy remains at approximately 50% of the prior year's cash earnings. On January 30, 2013, the board of directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.45 per share. The dividend will be payable on March 25, 2013 to shareholders of record on March 8, 2013. Assuming no changes in the number of shares outstanding, the first quarter dividend payment will total approximately $149.3 million. The board of directors also declared an additional, annual variable dividend of $1.30 per share on December 5, 2012 paid on December 28, 2012 to the shareholders of record on December 17, 2012. This annual dividend will typically be considered in the first quarter of each year and will supplement the regular dividend. The annual variable dividend for 2013 was accelerated to the fourth quarter of 2012 due to uncertainty surrounding dividend income tax treatment beginning in 2013. In general, the amount of the annual variable dividend will be determined after the end of each year, and the level will increase or decrease from year to year based on operating results, potential merger and acquisition activity, and other forms of capital return including regular dividends and share buybacks during the prior year.Sources and Uses of CashThe following is a summary of cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities. Year-over-Year Change(dollars in millions) 2012 2011 2010 2012-2011 2011-2010Net cash provided by operating activities $1,216.8 $1,346.3 $1,359.6 (10)% (1)%Net cash used in investing activities (206.0) (153.6) (111.6) 35 38Net cash used in financing activities (448.4) (1,005.6) (653.4) (55) 54Operating activitiesIn 2012 when compared with 2011, net cash provided by operating activities decreased as a result of lower contract volumes.Net cash provided by operating activities decreased slightly in 2011 when compared with 2010. Increased profitability as a result of higher contract volumes was offset by an increase in other current assets and other assets resulting from a reclassification of cash from cash and cash equivalents to other current assets and other assets because the cash became subject to restrictions in conjunction with the contribution to the CMECE guaranty fund.Investing activitiesCash used in investing activities in 2012 was higher than cash used in 2011 due to the increased investment in business ventures, partially offset by the receipt of proceeds from the sale of the CBOT buildings.The increase in cash used in investing activities in 2011 when compared with 2010 was due to the proceeds from the sales of a long-term investment and our exercise rights privileges in 2010.Financing activitiesCash used in financing activities was lower in 2012 when compared with 2011. The decrease in cash used was attributable to the receipt of $747.7 million in proceeds from debt issued in September 2012 in contrast with repayments of $420.5 million of debt in the first quarter of 2011. In addition, we repurchased $220.4 million of Class A common stock in 2011. The net decrease in cash used was partially offset by a $851.5 million increase in cash dividends paid in 2012 when compared with 2011. The increase in cash used in 2011 compared with 2010 was attributable to proceeds from our issuance of shares to BM&FBOVESPA in 2010 and an increase in cash dividends in 2011 when compared with 2010. The increase in cash used was partially offset by a decrease in share repurchases of $354.9 million in 2011 when compared with the same period in 2010.51Table of ContentsDebt InstrumentsThe following table summarizes our debt outstanding as of December 31, 2012: (in millions)Par ValueFixed rate notes due August 2013, stated rate of 5.40%$750.0Fixed rate notes due February 2014, stated rate of 5.75%750.0Fixed rate notes due March 2018, stated rate of 4.40% (1)612.5Fixed rate notes due September 2022, stated rate of 3.00% (2)750.0(1)In February 2010, we entered into a forward-starting interest rate swap agreement that modified the interest obligation associated with these notes so that the interest payable on the notes effectively became fixed at a rate of 4.46%.(2)In August 2012, we entered into a forward-starting interest rate swap agreement that modified the interest obligation associated with these notes so that the interest payable on the notes effectively became fixed at a rate of 3.32%.In November 2012, the multi-currency revolving senior credit facility with various financial institutions was increased from $1.0 billion to $1.8 billion. The proceeds from the revolving senior credit facility can be used for general corporate purposes, which includes providing liquidity for our CME clearing house in certain circumstances and, if necessary, for maturities of commercial paper. As long as we are not in default under the new senior credit facility, we have the option to increase the facility up to $2.3 billion with the consent of the agent and lenders providing the additional funds. In November 2012, the maturity date was extended from January 2014 to January 2016 except for $95.0 million of the existing commitments. The $1.8 billion multi-currency revolving senior credit facility includes a provision to issue up to $250.0 million of stand-by letters of credit. The senior credit facility is voluntarily prepayable from time to time without premium or penalty. Under our credit facility, we are required to remain in compliance with a consolidated net worth test, which is defined as our consolidated shareholders' equity as of September 30, 2012, giving effect to share repurchases made and special dividends paid during the term of the agreement (and in no event greater than $2.0 billion in aggregate), multiplied by 0.65. We currently do not have any borrowings under this credit facility. We maintain a 364-day multi-currency line of credit with a consortium of domestic and international banks to be used in certain situations by our CME clearing house. We may use the proceeds to provide temporary liquidity in the unlikely event of a clearing firm default, in the event of a liquidity constraint or default by a depositary (custodian for our collateral), or in the event of a temporary disruption with the domestic payments system that would delay payment of settlement variation between us and our clearing firms. CME clearing firm guaranty fund contributions received in the form of U.S. Treasury securities, U.S. government agency securities or money market mutual funds as well as the performance bond assets of a defaulting firm can be used to collateralize the facility. At December 31, 2012, guaranty fund collateral available was $4.8 billion. The line of credit provides for borrowings of up to $5.0 billion. We have the option to request an increase in the line from $5.0 billion to $7.0 billion, subject to the approval of participating banks. In addition to the 364-day multi-currency line of credit, we also have the option to use the $1.8 billion multi-currency revolving senior credit facility to provide liquidity for our clearing house in the unlikely event of default in certain circumstances. In addition, our 364-day multi-currency line of credit contains a requirement that CME remain in compliance with a consolidated tangible net worth test, defined as CME consolidated shareholder's equity less intangible assets (as defined in the agreement) of not less than $625.0 million. In the event that CME elects to increase the facility, the minimum consolidated tangible net worth test would increase ratably up to $875.0 million. The indentures governing our fixed rate notes, our $1.8 billion multi-currency revolving senior credit facility and our 364-day multi-currency line of credit for $5.0 billion do not contain specific covenants that restrict the ability to pay dividends. These documents, however, do contain other customary financial and operating covenants that place restrictions on the operations of the company that could indirectly affect the ability to pay dividends. At December 31, 2012, we have excess borrowing capacity for general corporate purposes of approximately $1.8 billion under our multi-currency revolving senior credit facilities. At December 31, 2012, we were in compliance with the various covenant requirements of all our debt facilities. CME Group, as a holding company, has no operations of its own. Instead, it relies on dividends declared and paid to it by its subsidiaries in order to provide a portion of the funds which it uses to pay dividends to its shareholders. 52Table of ContentsTo satisfy our performance bond obligation with Singapore Exchange Limited, we may pledge CME-owned U.S. Treasury securities in lieu of, or in combination with, irrevocable letters of credit. At December 31, 2012, we had pledged letters of credit totaling $181.0 million. The following table summarizes our credit ratings as of December 31, 2012: Rating Agency Short-TermDebt Rating Long-TermDebt Rating OutlookStandard & Poor’s A1+ AA- NegativeMoody’s Investors Service P1 Aa3 StableGiven our cash flow generation, our ability to pay down debt levels and our ability to refinance existing debt facilities if necessary, we expect to maintain an investment grade rating. If our ratings are downgraded below investment grade due to a change of control, we are required to make an offer to repurchase our fixed rate notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest. Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsAs of December 31, 2012, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined by the regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission.Liquidity and Cash ManagementCash and cash equivalents totaled $1.6 billion at December 31, 2012 and $1.0 billion at December 31, 2011. The balance retained in cash and cash equivalents is a function of anticipated or possible short-term cash needs, prevailing interest rates, our investment policy and alternative investment choices. A majority of our cash and cash equivalents balance is invested in money market mutual funds that invest only in U.S. Treasury securities or U.S. government agency securities. Our exposure to credit and liquidity risk is minimal given the nature of the investments. Cash that is not available for general corporate purposes because of regulatory requirements or other restrictions is classified as restricted cash and is included in other current assets or other assets in the consolidated balance sheets. Our practice is to have our pension plan 100% funded at each year end on a projected benefit obligation basis, while also satisfying any minimum required contribution and obtaining the maximum tax deduction. Based on our actuarial projections, we estimate that a $19.9 million contribution in 2013 will allow us to meet our funding goal. However, the amount of the actual contribution is contingent on the actual rate of return on our plan assets during 2013 and the December 31, 2013 discount rate. Regulatory Requirements CME and KCBTCC are regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) as U.S. Derivatives Clearing Organizations (DCO). Beginning in May 2012, DCOs are required to maintain capital as defined by the CFTC in an amount at least equal to one year of projected operating expenses as well as cash, liquid securities, or a line of credit at least equal to six months of projected operating expenses. CME and KCBTCC are in compliance with the DCO financial requirements.CME, CBOT, NYMEX, COMEX and KCBT are regulated by the CFTC as Designated Contract Markets (DCM). Beginning in October 2012, DCMs are also required to maintain capital as defined by the CFTC in an amount at least equal to one year of projected operating expenses as well as cash, liquid securities, or a line of credit at least equal to six months of projected operating expenses. Our DCMs are in compliance with the DCM financial requirements.ITEM 7A.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKWe are subject to various market risks, including those caused by changes in interest rates, credit, foreign currency exchange rates and equity prices. Interest Rate Risk Debt outstanding at December 31, 2012 consisted of fixed rate borrowings of $2.9 billion. Changes in interest rates impact the fair values of fixed-rate debt, but do not impact earnings or cash flows. We did not have any variable rate borrowings at December 31, 2012. Credit Risk Our clearing houses act as the counterparties to all trades consummated on our exchanges as well as through third-party exchanges and over-the-counter markets for which we provide clearing services. As a result, we are exposed to significant credit risk of third parties, including clearing firms. We are also exposed, indirectly, to the credit risk of customers of our 53Table of Contentsclearing firms. These parties may default on their obligations due to bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, operational failure or other reasons. In November 2012, we acquired The Board of Trade of Kansas City, Missouri, Inc. (KCBT), including the Kansas City Board of Trade Clearing Corporation (KCBTCC). We expect to integrate KCBTCC operations with the operations of CME Clearing, a division of CME, during 2013. As of December 31, 2012, we maintained a separate financial safeguard package for KCBTCC clearing firms. In February 2013, the KCBTCC financial safeguard package was incorporated into the CME Clearing financial safeguard package. In order to ensure performance, we establish and monitor financial requirements for our clearing firms. We set minimum performance bond requirements for exchange-traded and over-the-counter products, including credit default swaps and interest rate swaps. For CME and KCBTCC clearing firms, we establish performance bond requirements to cover at least 99% of expected price changes for a given product within a given historical period with further quantitative and qualitative considerations based on market risk. For CMECE clearing firms, we establish performance bond requirements to cover at least 95% to 99% of expected price changes for a given product within a given historical period with further quantitative and qualitative considerations based on market risk. We establish haircuts applied to collateral deposited to meet performance bond requirements to cover at least 99% of expected price changes and foreign currency changes for a given asset within a given historical period with further quantitative and qualitative considerations. Haircuts vary depending on the type of collateral and maturity. We mark-to-market all open positions of CME, KCBTCC and CMECE clearing firms at least twice a day and require payment from clearing firms whose positions have lost value and make payments to clearing firms whose positions have gained value. For select cleared-only markets, positions are marked-to-market daily with the capability to mark-to-market more frequently as market conditions warrant. These practices allow our clearing houses to quickly identify any clearing firms that may not be able to satisfy the financial obligations resulting from changes in the prices of their open positions before those financial obligations become exceptionally large and jeopardize the ability of our clearing house to ensure performance of their open positions. This transparency makes it difficult for traders to hide losses or disguise unusual profits. Although we have policies and procedures to help ensure that our clearing firms can satisfy their obligations, these policies and procedures may not succeed in detecting problems or preventing defaults. We also have in place various measures intended to enable us to cover any default and maintain liquidity. Despite our safeguards, we cannot assure you that these measures will be sufficient to protect us from a default or that we will not be materially and adversely affected in the event of a significant default.CME ClearingWe maintain three separate financial safeguard packages for CME Clearing member firms: •a financial safeguard package for all futures and options contracts other than cleared over-the-counter credit default swap and interest rate swap contracts (base package),•a financial safeguard package for cleared over-the-counter credit default swap contracts, and •a financial safeguard package for cleared over-the-counter interest rate swap contracts.In the unlikely event of a payment default by a clearing firm, we would first apply assets of the defaulting clearing firm to satisfy its payment obligation. These assets include the defaulting firm's guaranty fund contributions, performance bonds and any other available assets, such as assets required for membership and any associated trading rights. In addition, we would make a demand for payment pursuant to any applicable guarantee provided to us by the parent company of the clearing firm. Thereafter, if the payment default remains unsatisfied, we would use the corporate contributions designated for the respective financial safeguard package. We would then use guaranty fund contributions of other clearing firms within the respective financial safeguard package and funds collected through an assessment against solvent clearing firms within the respective financial safeguard package to satisfy the deficit.We maintain a $5.0 billion 364-day multi-currency line of credit with a consortium of domestic and international banks to be used in certain situations by CME Clearing. We have the option to request an increase in the line from $5.0 billion to $7.0 billion. We may use the proceeds to provide temporary liquidity in the unlikely event of a clearing firm default, in the event of a liquidity constraint or default by a depositary (custodian of the collateral), or in the event of a temporary disruption with the payments systems that would delay payment of settlement variation between us and our clearing firms. The credit agreement requires us to pledge certain assets to the line of credit custodian prior to drawing on the line of credit. Pledged assets may include clearing firm guaranty fund deposits held by us in the form of U.S. Treasury or agency securities, as well as select money market mutual funds approved for our select Interest Earning Facility (IEF) programs. Performance bond collateral of a defaulting clearing firm may also be used to secure a draw on the line. In addition to the 364-day multi-currency line of credit, we also have the option to use our $1.8 billion multi-currency revolving senior credit facility to provide liquidity for our clearing house in the unlikely event of default. 54Table of ContentsAggregate performance bond deposits for clearing firms for all three CME financial safeguard packages was $86.8 billion, including $5.6 billion of cash performance bond deposits and $4.2 billion of letters of credit. A defaulting firm's performance bond deposits can be used in the event of default of that clearing firm. The following shows the available assets at December 31, 2012 in the event of a payment default by a clearing firm for the base financial safeguard package after first utilizing the defaulting firm's available assets: (in millions) CME ClearingAvailable AssetsDesignated corporate contributions for futures and options(1) $100.0Guaranty fund contributions(2) 2,899.5Assessment powers(3) 7,973.6Minimum Total Assets Available for Default(4) $10,973.1_______________(1)CME Clearing designates $100.0 million of corporate contributions to satisfy a clearing firm default in the event that the defaulting clearing firm's guaranty contributions and performance bonds do not satisfy the deficit.

KCBTCCAt December 31, 2012, we maintained a separate guaranty fund for KCBTCC clearing firms. Aggregate performance bond deposits for KCBTCC clearing firms were $441.1 million, including $7.6 million in cash performance bonds at December 31, 2012. The guaranty fund contributions were $30.6 million at December 31, 2012. This collateral was incorporated into CME Clearing's base package in February 2013. CMECEWe maintain a financial safeguard package for CMECE over-the-counter commodity clearing firms. In the unlikely event of default by a CMECE clearing firm, we would first apply assets of the defaulting clearing firm to satisfy its payment obligations. These assets include the defaulting firm's performance bonds. Aggregate cash performance bond deposits for CMECE clearing firms were $54.5 million. There were no non-cash performance bonds on deposit at December 31, 2012. Thereafter, if the default remains unsatisfied after first applying assets of the defaulting clearing firm to satisfy its payment obligation, we would use guaranty fund contributions of $60.0 million of CMECE funds for commodity clearing firms. As of December 31, 2012, guaranty fund contributions were contributed by CMECE instead of by the clearing firms. Commodity clearing firms will begin contributing to the commodity guaranty fund in 2013. Once the CMECE clearing firms contribute to the commodity guaranty fund, we would still use at least $20.0 million of CMECE funds in addition to the clearing firms' guaranty fund contributions in the event of a default of a commodity clearing firm. Beginning in 2013, we will maintain a separate financial safeguard package for CMECE interest rate swap clearing firms. CMECE will begin offering to clear interest rate swap contracts in the first quarter of 2013. In the unlikely event of default by a CMECE clearing firm, we will first apply assets of the defaulting clearing firm to satisfy its payment obligations. If the default remains unsatisfied, we will apply guaranty fund contributions of $52.5 million for interest rate swap clearing firms that will be contributed by CMECE instead of by the clearing firms. In the future, the interest rate swap clearing firms may be asked to contribute to the interest rate swap guaranty fund. Once the CMECE clearing firms contribute to the guaranty fund, we would still use at least $52.5 million of CMECE funds in the event of a default of a interest rate swap clearing firm.Foreign Currency Exchange Rate RiskForeign Currency Transaction Risk Our exposure to foreign currency transaction risk resulting from our operations is considered minimal and is not expected to be material to our financial condition or operating results. Foreign Currency Translation Risk We have foreign currency translation risk related to the translation of our foreign subsidiaries' assets and liabilities from their respective functional currencies to the U.S. dollar at each reporting date. Fluctuations in exchange rates may impact the amount of assets and liabilities we report in our consolidated balance sheets. The financial statements of certain of our foreign subsidiaries are denominated in various currencies and are translated into U.S. dollars using a current exchange rate. Gains and losses resulting from this translation are recognized as a foreign currency translation adjustment within accumulated other comprehensive income, which is a component of shareholders' equity and comprehensive income. Aggregate translation adjustments, net of tax, for 2012, 2011 and 2010 were $10.9 million, $83.3 million and $(0.5) million, respectively. In 2011, we 56Table of Contentsreversed an unrealized loss of $81.7 million, net of tax, which was attributable to foreign currency translation adjustments that were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) upon recognizing impairment on our investment in BM&FBOVESPA. Foreign Currency Risk Related to Equity InvestmentsWe are also exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to certain equity investments as discussed in the Equity Price Risk section below. Foreign Currency Exchange Risk Related to Customer CollateralA portion of performance bond deposits is denominated in foreign currency. We mark-to-market all deposits once a day and require payment from clearing firms whose collateral has lost value due to changes in foreign currency rates and price. Therefore, our exposure to foreign currency risk related to performance bond deposits is considered minimal and is not expected to be material to our financial condition or operating results.Equity Price RiskWe hold certain investments in equity securities for strategic purposes. Investments subject to equity price risks are generally recorded at their fair value. Fair values for publicly-traded equity investments are based on quoted market prices. Fair values are subject to fluctuation and, consequently, the amount realized in the subsequent sale of an investment may differ significantly from its current reported value. Fluctuations in the market price of a security may result from perceived changes in the underlying economic characteristics of the issuer, the relative price of alternative investments and general market conditions. The table below summarizes equity investments that are subject to equity price fluctuations at December 31, 2012. Equity investments are included in other assets in our consolidated balance sheets.

The following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations includes the financial results of NEX beginning on November 3, 2018.References in this discussion and analysis to “we” and “our” are to CME Group Inc. (CME Group) and its consolidated subsidiaries, collectively. References to “exchange” are to Chicago Mercantile Exchange Inc. (CME), the Board of Trade of the City of Chicago, Inc. (CBOT), New York Mercantile Exchange, Inc. (NYMEX), Commodity Exchange, Inc. (COMEX), and NEX, collectively, unless otherwise noted. EXECUTIVE SUMMARYBusiness OverviewCME Group, a Delaware stock corporation, is the holding company for CME, CBOT, NYMEX, COMEX, NEX and their respective subsidiaries. The holding company structure is designed to provide strategic and operational flexibility. CME Group's Class A common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market (NASDAQ) under the ticker symbol ""CME."" Our exchange consists of designated contract markets for the trading of futures and options on futures contracts. We also clear futures, options on futures and swaps contracts through our clearing house. Futures contracts, options on futures contracts and swaps contracts provide investors with vehicles for protecting against, and potentially profiting from, price changes in financial instruments and physical commodities. We are a global exchange with customer access available virtually all over the world. Our customers consist of professional traders, financial derivatives institutions, individual and institutional investors, major corporations, manufacturers, producers and governments. Customers include both members of the exchange and non-members. We offer our customers the opportunity to trade futures contracts and options on futures contracts on a range of products including those based on interest rates, equity indexes, foreign exchange, agricultural commodities, energy and metals. Through our acquisition of NEX, we now offer fixed income trading through BrokerTec and foreign currency trading through EBS, which are both included in the cash markets business. Our products provide a means for hedging, speculating and allocating assets. We identify new products by monitoring economic trends and their impact on the risk management and speculative needs of our existing and prospective customers. Most of our products are available for trading through our electronic trading platforms. These execution facilities offer our customers immediate trade execution and price transparency. In addition, trades can be executed through privately negotiated transactions that are cleared and settled through our clearing house. Through the acquisition with NEX, we now provide optimization services that deliver transaction lifecycle management and information services to help our customers optimize their capital, mitigate their risk and reduce operational costs. Optimization services includes Traiana and TriOptima.Our clearing house clears, settles and guarantees futures and options contracts traded through our exchanges, in addition to cleared swaps products. Our clearing house's performance guarantee is an important function of our business. Because of this guarantee, our customers do not need to evaluate the credit of each potential counterparty or limit themselves to a selected set of counterparties. This flexibility increases the potential liquidity available for each trade. Additionally, the substitution of our 29Table of Contentsclearing house as the counterparty to every transaction allows our customers to establish a position with one party and offset the position with another party. This contract offsetting process provides our customers with flexibility in establishing and adjusting positions and provides for collateral and margining efficiencies. Certain BrokerTec and EBS contracts are cleared at third-party clearing houses. Business TrendsEconomic Environment. Our customers continue to use our markets as an effective and transparent means to manage risk and meet their investment needs despite economic uncertainty and volatility. Trading activity in our centralized markets has fluctuated due to the ongoing uncertainty in the financial markets caused by the United States and European credit crises, fluctuations in the availability of credit, variations in the amount of assets under management as well as the Federal Reserve Bank’s interest rate policy and quantitative easing. We continue to maintain high quality and diverse products as well as various clearing and market data services which support our customers in any economic environment. Competitive Environment. Our industry is competitive and we continue to encounter competition in all aspects of our business. We expect competition to continue to intensify, especially in light of ongoing regulatory reform in the financial services industry. Competition is influenced by our brand and reputation; the efficiency and security of our services; depth and liquidity of our markets; diversity of product offerings including rate and quality of new product development and innovative services; our ability to position and expand upon existing products; efficient and seamless customer experience; transparency, reliability and anonymity of transaction processing; the regulatory environment; connectivity, accessibility, flexibility in execution methods; efficient and innovative technology and connectivity, as well as transaction costs. We believe we are very well positioned with respect to these factors. Our asset classes contain products designed to address differing risk management needs, and customers are able to achieve operational and capital efficiencies by accessing our diverse products through our platforms and our clearing house. We face competition from other futures, securities and securities option exchanges; clearing organizations; swap execution facilities; alternative trade execution facilities; technology firms, including market data distributors and electronic trading system developers; and others. As markets continue to evolve, we will continue to adapt our trading technology and clearing services to meet the needs of our customers. Regulatory Environment. Exchange-traded derivatives have historically been subject to extensive regulation. Developments in the regulatory environment have the potential to significantly impact our business. Compliance with regulations may require us and our customers to dedicate significant financial and operational resources which could adversely affect our profitability. The regulatory environment to which we are subject is discussed in ""Item 1. Business"" on page 10.Business StrategyOur strategy focuses on maximizing futures and options growth globally, diversifying our business and revenues, and delivering unparalleled capital and cost efficiency solutions. We focus specifically on opportunities created by increased market awareness and acceptance of derivatives, increased price volatility, technological advances and the increasing need for counterparty risk mitigation and clearing services. This strategy allows us to continue to develop into a more broadly diversified financial exchange that provides trading and clearing solutions across a wide range of products and asset classes. Our strategic initiatives are discussed in ""Item 1. Business"" on page 7. RevenuesClearing and transaction fees. A majority of our revenue is derived from clearing and transaction fees, which include electronic trading fees, surcharges for privately negotiated transactions and other volume-related charges for exchange-traded and over-the-counter contracts. Because clearing and transaction fees are assessed on a per-contract or notional value basis, revenues and profitability fluctuate with changes in contract volume. In addition to the business trends noted earlier, our contract volume, and consequently our revenues, tend to increase during periods of economic and geopolitical uncertainty as our customers seek to manage their exposure to, or speculate on, the market volatility resulting from that uncertainty. While volume has the most significant impact on our clearing and transaction fees revenue, there are four other factors that also influence this source of revenue: •rate structure;•product mix;•venue, and•the percentage of trades executed by customers who are members compared with non-member customers. 30Table of ContentsRate structure. Customers benefit from volume discounts and limits on fees as part of our effort to increase liquidity in certain products. We offer various incentive programs to promote trading and clearing in various products and geographic locations. We may periodically change fees, volume discounts, fee limits and member discounts, perhaps significantly, based on our review of operations and the business environment. Product mix. We offer exchange-traded futures and options on futures contracts as well as cleared-only interest rate swap contracts. Through our acquisition of NEX, we also offer foreign exchange spot and forward contracts and fixed income products. Rates are varied by product in order to optimize revenue on existing products and to encourage contract volume upon introduction of new products. Venue. Our exchange and platforms are an international marketplace that brings together buyers and sellers mainly through our electronic trading as well as through open outcry trading and privately negotiated transactions. Any customer who is guaranteed by a clearing firm and who agrees to be bound by our exchange rules is able to obtain direct access to our CME electronic platforms. Open outcry trading is conducted exclusively by our members, who may execute trades on behalf of customers or for themselves. Typically, customers submitting trades through our electronic platforms are charged fees for using the platforms in addition to the fees assessed on all transactions executed on our exchange. Customers entering into privately negotiated transactions also incur additional charges beyond the fees assessed on other transactions. Member/non-member mix. Generally, member customers are charged lower fees than our non-member customers. Holding all other factors constant, revenue decreases if the percentage of trades executed by members increases, and increases if the percentage of non-member trades increases. Clearing and transaction fees for cash markets business. Our cash markets business provides matching services whereby we match a buyer and seller of financial instruments to allow both parties to complete the trade bilaterally or through a third-party clearing house. We are not involved in the settlement of the contract but charge a transaction fee generally based on volume or notional value of the trade for providing the matching service. The cash markets business also includes BrokerTec U.S., which generates revenue from a matched principal business. Matched principal trades involve BrokerTec U.S. purchasing a financial instrument from one market participant and selling it to another market participant. Revenue is generated from this business generally on a transaction fee basis. Other sources. Revenue is also derived from other sources including market data and information services and other various services related to our exchange operations. Market data and information services. We receive market data and information services revenue from the dissemination of our market data to subscribers. Subscribers can obtain access to our market data services either directly or through third party distributors. Our service offerings include access to real-time, delayed and end-of-day quotations, trade and summary market data for our products and other data sources. Users of our basic service receive real-time quotes and pay a flat monthly fee for each screen, or device, displaying our market data. Alternatively, customers can subscribe to market data provided on a limited group of products. The fee for this service is also a flat rate per month.Pricing for our market data services is based on the value of the service provided and the price of comparable services offered by our competitors. Increases or decreases in our market data and information services revenue are influenced by changes in our price structure for existing market data offerings, introduction of new market data services and changes in the number of devices in use. General economic factors that affect the financial services industry, which constitutes our primary customer base, also influence revenue from our market data services. Other revenues. Other revenue includes access and communication fees. Access and communication fees are connectivity fees charged to members and clearing firms that utilize our various telecommunications networks and communications services. Our communication services include our co-location program as well as the connectivity charges to customers of the CME Globex platform. Access fee revenue varies depending on the type of connection provided to customers. Beginning on November 3, 2018, other revenues include revenues from NEX's optimization services, which include fees for risk management and information services for the over-the-counter markets, including portfolio reconciliation and post-trade processing. Revenue earned from these services is typically generated through subscriptions or transaction fees. Other revenues also include fees for post-trade services, fees for collateral management, equity subscription fees and fees for trade order routing through agreements from various strategic relationships as well as other services to members and clearing firms. 31Table of ContentsExpensesThe majority of our expenses do not vary directly with changes in our contract volume. However, licensing and other fee agreements can vary directly with certain equity, energy and swap volumes as well as the majority of our employee bonuses vary directly with overall contract volume. Compensation and benefits. Compensation and benefits expense is our most significant expense and includes employee wages, bonuses, stock-based compensation, benefits and employer taxes. Changes in this expense are driven by fluctuations in the number of employees, increases in wages as a result of inflation or labor market conditions, changes in rates for employer taxes and other cost increases affecting benefit plans. In addition, this expense is affected by the composition of our workforce. The expense associated with our bonus and stock-based compensation plans can also have a significant impact on this expense category. The bonus component of our compensation and benefits expense is based on our financial performance. Under the performance criteria of our annual incentive plans, the bonus funded under the plans is based on achieving certain financial performance targets established by the compensation committee of our board of directors. The compensation committee has discretion to make equitable adjustments to the cash earnings performance calculation to reflect effects of unplanned operating results or capital expenditures to meet intermediate- to long-term growth opportunities. In general, stock-based compensation is a non-cash expense related to restricted stock and performance share grants. Stock-based compensation varies depending on the quantity and fair value of awards granted. The fair value of restricted stock awards and other performance share grants is based on either the share price on the date of the grant or a model of expected future stock prices. As part of the acquisition of NEX, some of the expense associated with NEX awards will be settled in cash. Professional fees and outside services. This expense includes fees for consulting services received on strategic and technology initiatives; regulatory and other compliance matters; temporary labor as well as legal and accounting fees. This expense may fluctuate as a result of changes in services required to complete initiatives, handle legal proceedings and comply with regulatory and compliance requirements.Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense results from the depreciation of long-lived assets such as buildings, leasehold improvements, furniture, fixtures and equipment. This expense also includes the amortization of purchased and internally developed software. Amortization of purchased intangibles. Amortization of purchased intangibles includes amortization of intangible assets obtained in our acquisitions of CBOT Holdings, Inc., NYMEX Holdings, Inc. and NEX as well as other asset and business acquisitions. Intangible assets subject to amortization consist primarily of clearing firm, market data and other customer relationships. Other expenses. We incur additional ongoing expenses for communications, technology support services and various other activities necessary to support our operations. •Technology expense consists of costs related to maintenance of the hardware and software required to support our technology. It also includes costs for network connections for our electronic platforms and some market data customers; telecommunications costs of our exchange, and fees paid for access to external market data. This expense may be driven by system capacity, functionality and redundancy requirements. It also may be impacted by growth in electronic contract volume and changes in the number of telecommunications hubs and connections which allow customers outside the United States to access our electronic platforms directly. •Licensing and other fee agreements expense includes license fees paid as a result of contract volume in equity index products. This expense also includes royalty fees and broker rebates on energy and metals products as well as revenue sharing on cleared swaps contracts and some new product launches. This expense fluctuates with changes in contract volumes as well as changes in fee structures. •Other expenses include occupancy and building operations expenses including rent, maintenance, real estate taxes, utilities and other related costs related to leased property in Chicago, New York, the United Kingdom, India as well as other smaller locations throughout the world. Other expenses also include marketing and travel-related expenses as well as general and administrative costs. Marketing, advertising and public relations expense includes media, print and other advertising costs, as well as costs associated with our product promotion. Other expenses also include litigation and customer settlements, impairment charges on operating assets, gains and losses on disposals of operating assets, and foreign currency transaction gains and losses resulting from changes in exchange rates on certain foreign monetary assets and liabilities. 32Table of ContentsNon-Operating Income and ExpensesIncome and expenses incurred through activities outside of our core operations are considered non-operating. These activities include non-core investing and financing activities. •Investment income includes income from short-term investment of clearing firms' cash performance bonds and guaranty fund contributions as well as excess operating cash; interest income and realized gains and losses from our marketable securities; realized gains and losses as well as dividend income from our strategic equity investments, and gains and losses on trading securities in our non-qualified deferred compensation plans. Investment income is influenced by market interest rates, changes in the levels of cash performance bonds deposited by clearing firms, the amount of dividends distributed by our strategic investments and the availability of funds generated by operations. •Interest and other borrowing costs expense includes charges associated with various short-term and long-term funding facilities, including commitment fees on lines of credit agreements.•Equity in net earnings (losses) of unconsolidated subsidiaries includes income and losses from our investments in S&P/Dow Jones Indices LLC (S&P/DJI), Dubai Mercantile Exchange and Bursa Malaysia Derivatives Berhad.•Other income (expense) includes expenses related to the distribution of interest earned on performance bond collateral reinvestment to the clearing firms, gains and losses on derivative contracts as well as other various income and expenses outside our core operations.CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIESThe notes to our consolidated financial statements include disclosure of our significant accounting policies. In establishing these policies within the framework of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, management must make certain assessments, estimates and choices that will result in the application of these principles in a manner that appropriately reflects our financial condition and results of operations. Critical accounting policies are those policies that we believe present the most complex or subjective measurements and have the most potential to affect our financial position and operating results. While all decisions regarding accounting policies are important, there are certain accounting policies that we consider to be critical. These critical policies, which are presented in detail in the notes to our consolidated financial statements, relate to the valuation of financial instruments, goodwill and intangible assets, revenue recognition, income taxes and internal use software costs. Valuation of financial instruments. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, or an exit price. We have categorized financial instruments measured at fair value into the following three-level fair value hierarchy based upon the level of judgment associated with the inputs used to measure the fair value: •Level 1—Inputs are unadjusted, quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date. •Level 2— Inputs consist of observable market data, other than level 1 inputs, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs other than quoted prices that are directly observable. •Level 3—Inputs are unobservable and reflect management’s best estimate of what market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. Assets and liabilities carried at level 3 fair value generally include assets and liabilities with inputs that require management’s judgment.For further discussion regarding the fair value of financial assets and liabilities, see note 19 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Goodwill and intangible assets. We review goodwill for impairment on a quarterly basis and whenever events or circumstances indicate that its carrying value may not be recoverable. Goodwill may be tested quantitatively for impairment by comparing the carrying value of a reporting unit to its estimated fair value. Estimating the fair value of a reporting unit involves the use of valuation techniques that rely on significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions may include forecasted revenue growth rates; forecasted operating margins; risk-adjusted discount rates; forecasted economic and market conditions, and industry multiples. We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable given the information that is available to us at the time of our assessment; however, actual future results may differ significantly from those estimates. Under certain favorable circumstances, goodwill may be reviewed qualitatively for indications of impairment without utilizing valuation techniques to estimate fair value. The qualitative assessment of goodwill may rely on significant assumptions about forecasts of revenue growth, operating margins and economic conditions as well as overall market and industry-specific trends. We also review indefinite-lived intangible assets on a quarterly basis or more frequently when events and circumstances indicate that their carrying values may not be recoverable. Indefinite-lived intangible assets may be tested quantitatively for 33Table of Contentsimpairment by comparing their carrying values to their estimated fair values. Estimating the fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets involves the use of valuation techniques that rely on significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions may include forecasted revenue growth rates, forecasted allocations of expense and risk-adjusted discount rates. We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable given the information that is available to us at the time of our assessment; however, actual future results may differ significantly from those estimates. Similar to goodwill, under certain favorable circumstances, indefinite-lived intangible assets may be reviewed qualitatively for indications of impairment without utilizing valuation techniques to estimate fair value. The qualitative assessment of indefinite-lived intangible assets may rely on significant assumptions about forecasts of revenue growth, operating margins and economic conditions as well as overall market and industry-specific trends.Intangible assets subject to amortization are also assessed for impairment on a quarterly basis or more frequently when indicated by a change in economic or operational circumstances. The impairment assessment of these assets requires management to first compare the book value of the amortizing asset to undiscounted cash flows. If the book value exceeds the undiscounted cash flows, management is then required to estimate the fair value of the assets and record an impairment loss for the excess of the carrying value over the fair value and annually challenge the useful lives. Revenue recognition. A significant portion of our revenue is derived from the clearing and transaction fees we assess on each contract executed through our trading venues and cleared through our clearing house. Clearing and transaction fees are recognized as revenue when a buy and sell order are matched and when the trade is cleared. On occasion, the customer's exchange trading privileges may not be properly entered by the clearing firm and incorrect fees are charged for the transactions in the affected accounts. When this information is corrected within the time period allowed by the exchange, a fee adjustment is provided to the clearing firm. An accrual is established for estimated fee adjustments to reflect corrections to customer exchange trading privileges. The accrual is based on the historical pattern of adjustments processed as well as specific adjustment requests.Income taxes. Calculation of the income tax provision includes an estimate of the income taxes that will be paid for the current year as well as an estimate of income tax liabilities or benefits deferred into future years. Deferred tax assets are reviewed to determine if they will be realized in future periods. To the extent it is determined that some deferred tax assets may not be fully realized, the assets are reduced to their realizable value by a valuation allowance. The calculation of our tax provision involves uncertainty in the application of complex tax regulations. We recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the United States and other applicable foreign tax jurisdictions using a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold based on the technical merits of the tax position taken or expected to be taken. If the actual obligation of these amounts varies from our estimate, our income tax provision would be reduced or increased at the time that determination is made. This determination may not be known for several years. Past tax audits have not resulted in tax adjustments that resulted in a material change to the income tax provision in the year the audit was completed. The effective tax rate, defined as the income tax provision as a percentage of income before income taxes, will vary from year to year based on changes in tax jurisdictions, tax rates and regulations. In addition, the effective tax rate will vary with changes to income that are not subject to income tax and changes in expenses or losses that are not deductible, such as the utilization of foreign net operating losses. Internal use software costs. Certain internal and external costs that are incurred in connection with developing or obtaining computer software for internal use are capitalized. We also enter into software hosting arrangements for software projects maintained in the cloud. Software development costs incurred during the planning or maintenance stages of a software project are expensed as incurred, while costs incurred during the application development stage are capitalized and are amortized over the estimated useful life of the software, generally two to four years. Amortization of capitalized costs begins only when the software becomes ready for its intended use. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTSRefer to Note 2 in our notes to the consolidated financial statements for information on newly adopted and recently issued accounting pronouncements that are applicable to us. 34Table of ContentsRESULTS OF OPERATIONSFinancial HighlightsThe following summarizes significant changes in our financial performance for the years presented.

Total contract volume includes contracts that are traded on our exchange and cleared through our clearing house and certain cleared-only contracts. Volume is measured in round turns, which is considered a completed transaction that involves a purchase and an offsetting sale of a contract. Average rate per contract is determined by dividing total clearing and transaction fees by total contract volume. Contract volume and average rate per contract disclosures below exclude trading volume for the cash markets business as well as credit default swaps and interest rate swaps. Year-over-Year Change 2018 2017 2016 2018-2017 2017-2016Total contract volume (in millions)4,844.4 4,089.2 3,943.7 18 % 4 %Clearing and transaction fees (in millions)$3,513.9 $3,029.9 $2,974.4 16 2Average rate per contract0.725 0.741 0.754 (2) (2)We estimate the following increases (decreases) in clearing and transaction fees based on changes in total contract volume and changes in average rate per contract during 2018 compared with 2017, and during 2017 compared with 2016. Year-over-Year Change(in millions) 2018-2017 2017-2016Increases due to change in total contract volume $547.8 $109.8Decrease due to change in average rate per contract (63.8) (54.3)Net increases in clearing and transaction fees $484.0 $55.5Average rate per contract is impacted by our rate structure, including volume-based incentives, product mix, trading venue and the percentage of volume executed by customers who are members compared with non-member customers. Due to the 35Table of Contentsrelationship between average rate per contract and contract volume, the change in clearing and transaction fees attributable to changes in each is only an approximation.Contract VolumeThe following table summarizes average daily contract volume. Contract volume can be influenced by many factors, including political and economic factors, the regulatory environment and market competition. Year-over-Year Change(amounts in thousands) 2018 2017 2016 2018-2017 2017-2016Average Daily Volume by Product Line: Interest rates 9,951 8,189 7,517 22 % 9 %Equity indexes 3,589 2,682 3,061 34 (12)Foreign exchange 1,004 922 858 9 7Agricultural commodities 1,480 1,353 1,321 9 2Energy 2,561 2,578 2,432 (1) 6Metals 639 568 460 12 23Aggregate average daily volume 19,224 16,292 15,649 18 4 Average Daily Volume by Venue: CME Globex 17,371 14,513 13,766 20 5Open outcry 1,168 1,107 1,149 6 (4)Privately negotiated 685 672 734 2 (9)Aggregate average daily volume 19,224 16,292 15,649 18 4Electronic Volume as a Percentage of Total Volume 90% 89% 88% Overall contract volume increased from 2016 through 2018. Overall market volatility remained high throughout the last two years as the markets continued to experience uncertainty surrounding the Federal Reserve's interest rate policy, the United States' foreign trade policies and future rates of inflation. Throughout 2017 and 2018, the Federal Open Markets Committee raised the federal funds rate seven times, but raised the expectation of slower rate increases in 2019. We believe these factors led to the overall increases in contract volumes from 2016 to 2018.Interest Rate ProductsThe following table summarizes average daily contract volume for our key interest rate products. Eurodollar front 8 contracts include contracts expiring within two years. Eurodollar back 32 contracts include contracts expiring within three to ten years. Year-over-Year Change(amounts in thousands) 2018 2017 2016 2018-2017 2017-2016Eurodollar futures and options: Front 8 futures 2,131 1,745 1,828 22% (5)%Back 32 futures 839 769 729 9 5Options 1,416 1,368 1,225 3 12U.S. Treasury futures and options: 10-Year 2,363 1,914 1,717 23 115-Year 1,285 1,003 886 28 132-Year 560 396 331 41 20Treasury bond 484 380 347 28 9Federal Funds futures and options 259 191 133 36 44From 2016 to 2018, overall interest rate contract volumes increased due to volatility caused by continued uncertainty surrounding the Federal Reserve's interest rate policy, including volatility resulting from the Federal Open Markets Committee raising the federal funds rate seven times in 2017 and 2018. We also believe the increases in contract volumes were due to volatility caused by increased issuance of U.S. Treasury bills by the U.S. Department of Treasury as well as increased 36Table of Contentsuncertainty surrounding the United States' foreign trade policies, future rates of inflation and the potential for increased government spending. Equity Index ProductsThe following table summarizes average daily contract volume for our key equity index products. Year-over-Year Change(amounts in thousands) 2018 2017 2016 2018-2017 2017-2016E-mini S&P 500 futures and options 2,527 2,062 2,449 23% (16)%E-mini NASDAQ 100 futures and options 504 289 271 75 6In 2018 when compared with 2017, the increase in equity index contract volume was largely attributable to periods of higher equity market volatility, as measured by the CBOE Volatility Index and the CBOE Nasdaq-100 Volatility Index, throughout 2018. We believe the higher volatility was caused by greater market uncertainty, including uncertainty surrounding the United States' foreign trade policies and other political and economic policies of the United States. The decrease in overall equity index contract volume in 2017 when compared with 2016 resulted from periods of lower equity market volatility. The comparatively low volatility was believed to be caused by fewer market-moving geopolitical and macro-level events that impacted these indexes in 2017. During 2016, there were periods of higher volatility within the equity markets due to uncertainty regarding the Federal Open Markets Committee's decision to start raising interest rates in 2016, the deceleration of the Chinese economy, the results of the U.S. presidential and congressional elections, and declining global crude oil prices.Foreign Exchange ProductsThe following table summarizes average daily contract volume for our key foreign exchange products. Year-over-Year Change(amounts in thousands) 2018 2017 2016 2018-2017 2017-2016Euro 308 261 226 18 % 15 %Japanese yen 159 181 159 (12) 14British pound 142 137 125 3 10Australian dollar 118 102 106 15 (4)Canadian dollar 91 84 80 8 5Foreign exchange contract volumes increased from 2016 through 2018, primarily due to higher euro contract volumes resulting from market uncertainty caused by differences in monetary policies by the European Central Bank and the Federal Reserve. We believe the increases in British pound contract volumes were attributable to the ongoing uncertainty from the United Kingdom European Union membership referendum as well as the potential for future interest rate hikes. Japanese yen contract volume increased in 2017 when compared with 2016 as market participants turned to the yen as a safe-haven currency when currency rates steadied but decreased in 2018 due to stagnant economic growth for Japan in 2018. Agricultural Commodity ProductsThe following table summarizes average daily volume for our key agricultural commodity products. Year-over-Year Change(amounts in thousands) 2018 2017 2016 2018-2017 2017-2016Corn 482 449 424 7% 6 %Soybean 305 283 323 8 (12)Wheat 248 217 191 14 14In 2018 when compared with 2017, the increase in agricultural commodity contract volume was due to periods of higher price volatility throughout 2018, which we believe resulted from uncertainty surrounding crop production due to drought conditions in both South America and Australia. We also believe the increase in contract volume was attributable to volatility caused by concern surrounding the United States' foreign trade policies. 37Table of ContentsAgricultural commodity contract volume increased in 2017 when compared with 2016 largely due to higher corn and wheat volumes resulting from greater uncertainty related to weather conditions in 2017. The increase was partially offset by lower soybean volume due to lower uncertainty related to expectations of crop production versus 2016. Energy ProductsThe following table summarizes average daily volume for our key energy products. Year-over-Year Change(amounts in thousands) 2018 2017 2016 2018-2017 2017-2016WTI crude oil 1,439 1,442 1,321 — % 9%Natural gas 594 597 549 (1) 9Refined products 398 392 363 2 8In 2018 when compared with 2017, overall energy contract volume remained relatively flat. Crude oil contract volume remained flat due to lower price volatility, which we believe was the result of stability within the crude oil markets as supply was meeting global demand. Overall energy contract volume increased in 2017 when compared with 2016 largely due to an increase in crude oil contract volume caused by higher volatility in 2017. We believe the increased volatility was caused by a shift in crude oil supplies as United States crude oil production rose along with the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries' decision to cut oil supplies in the fourth quarter of 2016. Natural gas and refined products contract volumes also increased in 2017 due to higher price volatility caused by shifts in supply and demand in the underlying markets.Metal ProductsThe following table summarizes average daily volume for our key metal products. Year-over-Year Change(amounts in thousands) 2018 2017 2016 2018-2017 2017-2016Gold 375 335 273 12% 23%Copper 131 108 86 21 26Silver 103 98 78 5 25The overall increases in metal contract volumes from 2016 to 2018 were due to investors using gold and other precious metals as safe-haven alternative investments to other markets. We believe the increases in metal contract volumes were driven by consistent periods of high price volatility within other markets caused by the uncertainties surrounding the policies of the political administration in the United States and future rates of inflation.Average Rate per ContractThe slight decrease in average rate per contract in 2018 when compared with 2017 was largely due to a shift in product mix. Interest rate and equity contract volumes collectively increased by 4 percentage points as a percentage of total volume, while energy and agricultural commodity contract volumes collectively decreased by 3 percentage points. In general, interest rate and equity products have a lower rate per contract compared with energy and agricultural commodity products. The decrease resulting from a shift in product mix was partially offset by lower incentives.The average rate per contract decreased in 2017 when compared with 2016 due to a shift in product mix as interest rate volume increased by 2 percentage points as a percentage of total volume, while equity contract volume decreased by 3 percentage points. In general, interest rate products have a lower rate per contract compared with equity contracts. The overall decrease in average rate per contract was partially offset by a rate increase that was effective in the first quarter of 2017 and lower incentives.Cash Markets BusinessTotal clearing and transaction fees revenue in 2018 includes transaction fees of $91.2 million attributable to businesses acquired from NEX for the period of November 3, 2018 through December 31, 2018. This revenue includes $32.9 million in transaction fees from BrokerTec U.S.'s fixed income volume and $37.5 million from EBS's foreign exchange volume. 38Table of ContentsThe related average daily notional value for November 3, 2018 through December 31, 2018 were as follows:(amounts in billions) Average Daily Notional ValueU.S. Treasury $187.2European Repo (in euros) 253.6Spot FX 79.0Concentration of RevenueWe bill a significant portion of our clearing and transaction fees to our clearing firms. The majority of clearing and transaction fees received from clearing firms represent charges for trades executed and cleared on behalf of their customers. One firm represented 10% of our clearing and transaction fee revenue in 2018. One firm represented 13% and another firm represented 12% of our clearing and transaction fees revenue in 2017. One firm represented 13% and another firm represented 11% of our clearing and transaction fees revenue in 2016. Should a clearing firm withdraw, we believe that the customer portion of the firm's trading activity would likely transfer to another clearing firm of the exchange. Therefore, we do not believe we are exposed to significant risk from an ongoing loss of revenue received from or through a particular clearing firm. Other Sources of RevenueMarket data and information services. In 2018 when compared with 2017, the increase in market data and information services revenue was attributable to an increase in fees for basic real-time market data service to $105 per month from $85 per month beginning in the second quarter of 2018. The increase was partially offset by modest declines in screen counts due to cost-cutting initiatives at member firms. The increase in market data and information services revenue was also attributable to additional market data revenue generated by NEX subsequent to the acquisition of NEX on November 2, 2018. The decrease in market data and information services revenue in 2017 when compared with 2016 was due to a decline in screen counts from cost-cutting initiatives at member firms. The two largest resellers of our market data represented, in aggregate, 41%, 45% and 40% of our market data and information services revenue in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Despite this concentration, we consider exposure to significant risk of revenue loss to be minimal. In the event that one of these vendors no longer subscribes to our market data, we believe the majority of that vendor's customers would likely subscribe to our market data through another reseller. Additionally, several of our largest institutional customers that utilize services from our two largest resellers report usage and remit payment of their fees directly to us.Other revenues. The increase in other revenues for 2018 when compared with 2017 is largely attributable to the additional other revenue contributed by the NEX acquisition. Other revenues from NEX primarily include optimization services such as portfolio management, analytics, and trade and regulatory reporting.Expenses Year-over-Year Change(dollars in millions) 2018 2017 2016 2018-2017 2017-2016Compensation and benefits $672.2 $563.9 $543.2 19% 4 %Technology 117.2 101.6 97.6 15 4Professional fees and outside services 166.1 117.6 144.4 41 (19)Amortization of purchased intangibles 130.0 95.5 96.1 36 (1)Depreciation and amortization 118.7 113.0 129.2 5 (13)Licensing and other fee agreements 170.6 146.3 135.8 17 8Other 327.0 196.2 248.4 67 (21)Total Expenses $1,701.8 $1,334.1 $1,394.7 28 (4) 39Table of Contents2018 Compared With 2017Operating expenses increased by $367.7 million in 2018 when compared with 2017.

Gains and losses from exchange rate fluctuations result when subsidiaries with a U.S. dollar functional currency hold cash as well as certain other monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies.•Transaction costs incurred by CME Group pertaining to the NEX acquisition primarily include professional fees and transfer taxes. These costs accounted for a $75.5 million increase in operating expenses in 2018 when compared with 2017.•Licensing and other fee agreements expense increased during 2018 due to higher fees related to an increase in volume and an increase in license rates for certain products. •Bonus expense increased in 2018 due to improved performance relative to our cash earnings target in 2018 when compared with 2017 performance relative to our 2017 cash earnings target. •Compensation and benefits expense increased as a result of higher average headcount primarily in our international locations as well as normal cost of living adjustments.2017 Compared With 2016Operating expenses decreased by $60.6 million in 2017 when compared with 2016.

Gains and losses from exchange rate fluctuations result when subsidiaries with a U.S. dollar functional currency hold cash as well as certain other monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies.•In the first quarter of 2016, we sold and leased back our datacenter in the Chicago area. The transaction was recognized under the financing method under generally accepted accounting principles. We recognized total losses and expenses of $28.6 million, including a net loss on write-down to fair value of the assets and certain other transaction fees of $27.1 million within other expenses and $1.5 million of legal and other fees.•Professional fees and outside services expense decreased in 2017 compared to 2016, largely due to higher legal and regulatory fees in 2016 related to our business activities and product offerings as well as higher professional fees related to a greater reliance on consultants for security and systems enhancement work.The overall decrease in operating expenses in 2017 when compared with 2016 was partially offset by the following increases:•Licensing and other fee agreements expense increased due to higher expense resulting from incentive payments made to facilitate the transition of the Russell contract open interest, as well as increased costs of revenue sharing agreements for certain licensed products. The overall increase in 2017 was partially offset by lower expense related to revenue sharing agreements for certain equity and energy contracts due to lower volume for these products compared to 2016.•Compensation and benefits expense increased as a result of higher average headcount primarily in our international locations as well as normal cost of living adjustments.Non-Operating Income (Expense) Year-over-Year Change(dollars in millions) 2018 2017 2016 2018-2017 2017-2016Investment income $745.1 $531.7 $141.8 40 % n.m.Interest and other borrowing costs (157.7) (117.0) (123.5) 35 (5)Equity in net earnings (losses) of unconsolidated subsidiaries 152.8 129.2 110.2 18 17Other income (expense) (570.0) (328.2) (41.4) 74 n.m.Total Non-Operating $170.2 $215.7 $87.1 (21) 147 _______________n.m. not meaningfulInvestment income. The increases in investment income from 2016 to 2018 were largely due to increases in earnings from cash performance bond and guaranty fund contributions that are reinvested, which primarily resulted from higher rates of interest earned on the cash account at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago. In 2018, we recognized net realized and unrealized gains of $97.4 million on certain privately-held equity investments. In 2017, we sold our remaining ownership interest in BM&FBOVESPA S.A. (BM&FBOVESPA) and recognized a gain of $86.5 million, net of transaction costs. We also sold our 2% interest in Bolsa Mexicana de Valores, S.A.B. de C.V. and recognized a gain of $2.3 million, net of transaction costs. In 2016, we recognized a net gain of $48.4 million on sales of 28.0 million shares of our investment in BM&FBOVESPA. Interest and other borrowing costs. Interest and other borrowing costs were higher in 2018 when compared with 2017 and 2016 due to the issuance of $500.0 million of 3.75% fixed rate notes due June 2028 and $700.0 million of 4.15% fixed rate notes due June 2048 during the second quarter of 2018. Interest and other borrowing costs were also higher due to issuance of commercial paper and the assumption of the outstanding NEX debt as part of the acquisition. Equity in net earnings (losses) of unconsolidated subsidiaries. Higher income generated from our S&P/DJI business venture contributed to increases in equity in net earnings (losses) of unconsolidated subsidiaries from 2016 through 2018.Other income (expense). From 2016 to 2018, we recognized higher expenses related to the distribution of interest earned on performance bond collateral reinvestment to the clearing firms. In 2018, we recognized net losses of $62.3 million on various derivative contracts, which included our foreign exchange option and forward contracts used to mitigate certain exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuation on the currency required to facilitate the NEX acquisition as well as derivative contracts that we assumed in our acquisition of NEX. 41Table of ContentsIncome Tax ProvisionThe following table summarizes the effective tax rate for the periods presented: 2018 2017 2016 Year-over-Year Change2018-2017 2017-2016Year ended December 3129.3% (60.8)% 32.9% n.m. n.m._______________n.m. not meaningfulIn 2018 when compared with 2017, the effective tax rate increased primarily due to the remeasurement of the deferred tax liabilities recognized in 2017 from the U.S. income tax reform and state tax charges in 2018 related to the NEX acquisition. The overall decrease in the effective tax rate in 2017 when compared with 2016 was primarily due to the remeasurement of the deferred tax liabilities as a result of the U.S. income tax reform. The decrease was partially offset by expense from a state and local tax law change recorded in the third quarter of 2017 as well as from reclassifying income tax expense from other comprehensive income for the sale of the remaining BM&FBOVESPA shares.LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESCash RequirementsWe have historically met our funding requirements with cash generated by our ongoing operations. While our cost structure is fixed in the short term, our sources of operating cash are largely dependent on contract trading volume levels. We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to cover our working capital needs, capital expenditures and other commitments. However, it is possible that we may need to raise additional funds to finance our activities through issuances of commercial paper, future public debt offerings or by direct borrowings from financial institutions through our committed revolving credit facilities. Cash will also be required for operating leases and non-cancellable purchase obligations as well as other obligations reflected as long-term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2018. These were as follows: (in millions) OperatingLeases PurchaseObligations Debt Obligations OtherLong-TermLiabilities (1) TotalYear 2019 $82.5 $24.7 $720.4 $— $827.62020-2021 151.0 34.0 266.6 22.7 474.32022-2023 154.7 18.2 1,401.1 — 1,574.0Thereafter 586.2 — 4,324.9 — 4,911.1Total $974.4 $76.9 $6,713.0 $22.7 $7,787.0 _______________(1)The liability for gross unrecognized income tax benefits, including interest and penalties, of $459.7 million for uncertain tax positions is not included in the table due to uncertainty about the date of their settlement. It also excludes liabilities for lease arrangements as well as liabilities that have uncertainty associated with timing of payments, including liabilities for benefit plans. It also excludes liabilities that will not be settled in cash. Operating leases include rent payments for office space in Chicago, New York and other smaller offices in the United States and in various foreign countries. The operating lease for our headquarters in Chicago expires in 2032. Annual minimum rental payments under this lease range from $12.9 million to $20.8 million. We also maintain operating leases for datacenter space in Chicago, which expires in March 2031. Annual minimum rental payments under this lease range from $16.8 million to $18.3 million. The operating lease for our office space in New York expires in December 2028. Annual minimum rental payments under this lease range from $13.3 million to $14.5 million. Purchase obligations include minimum payments due under agreements for advertising, licensing, hardware, software and maintenance as well as telecommunication services. Debt obligations include repayment of principal and interest associated with the debt obligations. Other long-term liabilities include deferred payments for previous acquisitions completed by NEX before being acquired by CME Group. Future capital expenditures for technology are anticipated as we continue to support our growth through increased system capacity, performance improvements as well as improvements to some of our office spaces. Each year, capital expenditures are incurred for improvements to and expansion of our offices, remote data centers, telecommunications network and other 42Table of Contentsoperating equipment. In 2019, we expect capital expenditures to total approximately $180.0 million to $190.0 million. We continue to monitor our capital needs and may revise our forecasted expenditures as necessary in the future. We intend to continue to pay a regular quarterly dividend to our shareholders, which is set at between 50% to 60% of the prior year's cash earnings. The decision to pay a dividend and the amount of the dividend; however, remains within the discretion of our board of directors and may be affected by various factors, including our earnings, financial condition, capital requirements, levels of indebtedness and other considerations our board of directors deems relevant. CME Group is also required to comply with restrictions contained in the general corporation laws of its state of incorporation, which could also limit its ability to declare and pay dividends. On February 6, 2019 the board of directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.75 per share. The dividend will be payable on March 25, 2019 to shareholders of record on March 8, 2019. Assuming no changes in the number of shares outstanding, the first quarter dividend payment will total approximately $270.0 million. The board of directors also declared an additional, annual variable dividend of $1.75 per share on December 5, 2018 paid on January 16, 2019 to the shareholders of record on December 28, 2018. In general, the amount of the annual variable dividend will be determined by the end of each year, and the level will increase or decrease from year to year based on operating results, capitalization expenditures, potential merger and acquisition activity and other forms of capital return including regular dividends and share buybacks during the prior year. Sources and Uses of CashThe following is a summary of cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities.

The increase in cash provided by investing activities in 2017 when compared with 2016 was due to proceeds from the sale of BM&FBOVESPA and Bolsa Mexicana de Valores, S.A.B. de C.V. shares.Financing activitiesThe decrease in cash used in financing activities in 2018 when compared with 2017 was due to proceeds from the debt offering in the second quarter of 2018 as well as the net proceeds from issuance of commercial paper, which was used to finance the cash consideration for the acquisition of NEX. The decrease in cash used in financing activities was partially offset by an increase in cash dividends and the repayment of outstanding debt assumed in the acquisition of NEX. The increase in cash used by financing activities in 2017 when compared with 2016 was attributable to higher cash dividends declared in 2017. The increase was partially offset by proceeds from a finance lease obligation related to the sale leaseback of the datacenter in the first quarter of 2016. 43Table of ContentsDebt InstrumentsThe following table summarizes our debt outstanding as of December 31, 2018: (in millions)Par ValueFixed rate notes due March 2019, stated rate of 3.13% (1)€350.0Term loan due March 2019, stated rate at 0.81% (2)¥19,100.0Fixed rate notes due September 2022, stated rate of 3.00% (3)$750.0Fixed rate notes due May 2023, stated rate of 4.30%€15.0Fixed rate notes due March 2025, stated rate of 3.00% (4)$750.0Fixed rate notes due June 2028, stated rate of 3.75%$500.0Fixed rate notes due September 2043, stated rate of 5.30% (5)$750.0Fixed rate notes due June 2048, stated rate of 4.15%$700.0Commercial Paper$390.0 _______________(1)We maintain a cross-currency swap contract, which swaps a euro-based stated interest rate of 3.13% for a pound-based interest rate of 4.40% and a euro-based principal repayment for a pound-based principal repayment on €250.0 million fixed rate notes.

We used the net proceeds from the offering, together with cash on hand, to finance the cash consideration for the acquisition of NEX. In connection with the acquisition, we issued commercial paper in the fourth quarter of 2018 and have an outstanding balance of $389.9 million at December 31, 2018. The commercial paper is backed by the $2.4 billion multi-currency revolving senior credit facility. As part of our acquisition of NEX, we assumed their outstanding debt, which included a €350.0 million Eurobond maturing in March 2019, a ¥19.1 billion term loan maturing in March 2019 and a €15.0 million fixed rate note maturing in May 2023. NEX maintained a £350.0 million revolving credit facility that was paid down and terminated in November 2018. We maintain a $2.4 billion multi-currency revolving senior credit facility with various financial institutions, which matures in November 2022. The proceeds from this facility can be used for general corporate purposes, which includes providing liquidity for our clearing house in certain circumstances at CME Group's discretion and, if necessary, for maturities of commercial paper. As long as we are not in default under this facility, we have the option to increase it up to $3.0 billion with the consent of the agent and lenders providing the additional funds. This facility is voluntarily pre-payable from time to time without premium or penalty. Under this facility, we are required to remain in compliance with a consolidated net worth test, which is defined as our consolidated shareholders' equity at September 30, 2017, giving effect to share repurchases made and special dividends paid during the term of the agreements (and in no event greater than $2.0 billion in aggregate), multiplied by 0.65. We currently do not have any borrowings outstanding under this facility, but the outstanding commercial paper balance is backstopped against this facility. We maintain a 364-day multi-currency revolving secured credit facility with a consortium of domestic and international banks to be used in certain situations by CME Clearing. The facility provides for borrowings of up to $7.0 billion. We may use the proceeds to provide temporary liquidity in the unlikely event of a clearing firm default, in the event of a liquidity constraint or default by a depositary (custodian for our collateral), or in the event of a temporary disruption with the domestic payments system that would delay payment of settlement variation between us and our clearing firms. Clearing firm guaranty fund contributions received in the form of cash or U.S. Treasury securities as well as the performance bond assets of a defaulting firm can be used to collateralize the facility. At December 31, 2018, guaranty funds available to collateralize the facility totaled $7.4 billion. We have the option to request an increase in the line from $7.0 billion to $10.0 billion. Our 364-day facility contains a requirement that CME remain in compliance with a consolidated tangible net worth test, defined as CME consolidated shareholder's equity less intangible assets (as defined in the agreement), of not less than $800.0 million. We 44Table of Contentscurrently do not have any borrowings outstanding under this facility. On November 1, 2018, we amended and extended the agreement to include two extension dates, which allow us to terminate or extend the agreement within six or nine months. The indentures governing our fixed rate notes, our $2.4 billion multi-currency revolving senior credit facility and our 364-day multi-currency revolving secured credit facility for $7.0 billion do not contain specific covenants that restrict the ability to pay dividends. These documents, however, do contain other customary financial and operating covenants that place restrictions on the operations of the company that could indirectly affect the ability to pay dividends. At December 31, 2018, we have excess borrowing capacity for general corporate purposes of approximately $2.0 billion under our multi-currency revolving senior credit facility. At December 31, 2018, we were in compliance with the various covenant requirements of all our debt facilities. CME Group, as a holding company, has no operations of its own. Instead, it relies on dividends declared and paid to it by its subsidiaries in order to provide a portion of the funds which it uses to pay dividends to its shareholders. To satisfy our performance bond obligation with Singapore Exchange Limited, we may pledge CME-owned U.S. Treasury securities or U.S. dollars in lieu of, or in combination with, irrevocable letters of credit. At December 31, 2018, we had pledged letters of credit totaling $285.0 million. The following table summarizes our credit ratings as of December 31, 2018: Rating Agency Short-TermDebt Rating Long-TermDebt Rating OutlookStandard & Poor’s A1+ AA- StableMoody’s Investors Service P1 Aa3 StableGiven our cash flow generation, our ability to pay down debt levels and our ability to refinance existing debt facilities, if necessary, we expect to maintain an investment grade rating. If our ratings are downgraded below investment grade due to a change of control, we are required to make an offer to repurchase our CME Group fixed rate notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsAs of December 31, 2018, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined by Securities and Exchange Commission rules and regulations.Liquidity and Cash ManagementCash and cash equivalents totaled $1.4 billion at December 31, 2018 and $1.9 billion at December 31, 2017. The balance retained in cash and cash equivalents is a function of anticipated or possible short-term cash needs, prevailing interest rates, our investment policy and alternative investment choices. A majority of our cash and cash equivalents balance is invested in money market mutual funds that invest only in U.S. Treasury securities, U.S. government agency securities and U.S. Treasury security reverse repurchase agreements. Our exposure to credit and liquidity risk is minimal given the nature of the investments. Cash that is not available for general corporate purposes because of regulatory requirements or other restrictions is classified as restricted cash and is included in other current assets or other assets on the consolidated balance sheets.Our practice is to have our pension plan 100% funded at each year end on a projected benefit obligation basis, while also satisfying any minimum required contribution and obtaining the maximum tax deduction. Based on our actuarial projections, we estimate that no contribution will be necessary in 2019 as we exceeded our funding goal by $50.7 million in 2018. However, the amount of the actual contribution is contingent on various factors, including the actual rate of return on our plan assets during 2019 and the December 31, 2019 discount rate. Regulatory Requirements CME is regulated by the CFTC as a U.S. Derivatives Clearing Organization (DCO). DCOs are required to maintain capital, as defined by the CFTC, in an amount at least equal to one year of projected operating expenses as well as cash, liquid securities, or a line of credit at least equal to six months of projected operating expenses. CME was designated by the Financial Stability Oversight Council as a systemically important financial market utility under Title VIII of Dodd-Frank. As a result, CME must comply with CFTC regulations applicable to a systemically important DCO for financial resources and liquidity resources. CME is in compliance with all DCO financial requirements.CME, CBOT, NYMEX and COMEX are regulated by the CFTC as Designated Contract Markets (DCM). DCMs are required to maintain capital, as defined by the CFTC, in an amount at least equal to one year of projected operating expenses as well as cash, liquid securities or a line of credit at least equal to six months of projected operating expenses. Our DCMs are in compliance with all DCM financial requirements. 45Table of ContentsBrokerTec Americas LLC is required to maintain sufficient net capital under Securities Exchange Act Rule 15c3-1 (the “Net Capital Rule”). The Net Capital Rule focuses on liquidity and is designed to protect securities customers, counterparties, and creditors by requiring that broker-dealers have sufficient liquid resources on hand at all times to satisfy claims promptly. Rule 15c3-3, or the customer protection rule, which complements rule 15c3-1, is designed to ensure that customer property (securities and funds) in the custody of broker-dealers is adequately safeguarded. By law, both of these rules apply to the activities of registered broker-dealers, but not to unregistered affiliates. Since the firm does not hold any customer securities or funds, the firm received approval from the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority and the SEC to become a (k)(2)(i) broker dealer in November 2017. A company operating under the (k)(2)(i) exemption is not required to lock up customer funds as would otherwise be required under Rule 15c3-3 of the Securities Exchange Act.ITEM 7A.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKWe are subject to various market risks, including those caused by changes in interest rates, credit, foreign currency exchange rates and equity prices. Interest Rate Risk Debt outstanding at December 31, 2018 consisted of fixed-rate borrowings of $4.4 billion (in U.S. dollar equivalent). Changes in interest rates impact the fair values of fixed-rate debt, but do not impact earnings or cash flows. We did not have any variable-rate borrowings at December 31, 2018. At December 31, 2018, we maintained $389.9 million of commercial paper. Commercial paper is considered a fixed rate borrowing; however, because maturities for commercial paper are generally less than 90 days, commercial paper is considered subject to interest rate fluctuations.Credit Risk CME Clearing HouseOur clearing house acts as the counterparty to all trades consummated on our exchanges as well as through third party exchanges and swaps markets for which we provide clearing services. As a result, we are exposed to significant credit risk of third parties, including clearing firms. We are also exposed, indirectly, to the credit risk of customers of our clearing firms. These parties may default on their obligations due to bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, operational failure or other reasons. In order to ensure performance, we establish and monitor financial requirements for our clearing firms. We set minimum performance bond requirements for exchange-traded and interest rate swaps products. For clearing firms, we establish performance bond requirements to cover at least 99% of expected price changes for a given product within a given historical period with further quantitative and qualitative considerations based on market risk. We establish haircuts applied to collateral deposited to meet performance bond requirements to cover at least 99% of expected price changes and foreign currency changes for a given asset within a given historical period with further quantitative and qualitative considerations. Haircuts vary depending on the type of collateral and maturity. We mark-to-market open positions of clearing firms at least once a day (twice a day for futures and options contracts) and require payment from clearing firms whose positions have lost value and make payments to clearing firms whose positions have gained value. We have the capability to mark-to-market more frequently as market conditions warrant. These practices allow our clearing house to quickly identify any clearing firms that may not be able to satisfy the financial obligations resulting from changes in the prices of their open positions before those financial obligations become exceptionally large and jeopardize the ability of our clearing house to ensure performance of their open positions. Although we have policies and procedures to help ensure that our clearing firms can satisfy their obligations, these policies and procedures may not succeed in detecting problems or preventing defaults. We also have in place various measures intended to enable us to cover any default and maintain liquidity. Despite our safeguards, we cannot assure you that these measures will be sufficient to protect us from a default or that we will not be materially and adversely affected in the event of a significant default.We maintain two separate financial safeguard packages: •a financial safeguard package for all futures and options contracts other than cleared interest rate swap contracts (base package); and•a financial safeguard package for cleared interest rate swap contracts.In the unlikely event of a payment default by a clearing firm, we would first apply assets of the defaulting clearing firm to satisfy its payment obligation. These assets include the defaulting firm's guaranty fund contributions, performance bonds and any other available assets, such as assets required for clearing membership and any associated trading rights. In addition, we would make a demand for payment pursuant to any applicable guarantee provided to us by the parent company of the clearing firm. Thereafter, if the payment default remains unsatisfied, we would use our corporate contributions designated for the respective financial safeguard package. We would then use guaranty fund contributions of other clearing firms within the 46Table of Contentsrespective financial safeguard package and funds collected through an assessment against solvent clearing firms within the respective financial safeguard package to satisfy the deficit.We maintain a $7.0 billion 364-day multi-currency line of credit with a consortium of domestic and international banks to be used in certain situations by CME Clearing. We have the option to request an increase in the line from $7.0 billion to $10.0 billion. We may use the proceeds to provide temporary liquidity in the unlikely event of a clearing firm default, in the event of a liquidity constraint or default by a depositary (custodian of the collateral) or in the event of a temporary disruption with the payments systems that would delay payment of settlement variation between us and our clearing firms. The credit agreement requires us to pledge certain assets to the line of credit custodian prior to drawing on the line of credit. Pledged assets may include clearing firm guaranty fund deposits held by us in the form of cash or U.S. Treasury securities. Performance bond collateral of a defaulting clearing firm may also be used to secure a draw on the line. In addition to the 364-day multi-currency line of credit, we also have the option to use our $2.4 billion multi-currency revolving senior credit facility to provide liquidity for our clearing house in the unlikely event of default. At December 31, 2018, aggregate performance bond deposits for clearing firms for both financial safeguard packages was $143.2 billion including $38.2 billion of cash performance bond deposits and $2.7 billion of letters of credit. A defaulting firm's performance bond deposits can be used in the event of default of that clearing firm. The following shows the available assets at December 31, 2018 in the event of a payment default by a clearing firm for the base financial safeguard package after first utilizing the defaulting firm's available assets: (in millions) CME ClearingAvailable AssetsDesignated corporate contributions for futures and options(1) $100.0Guaranty fund contributions(2) 4,096.0Assessment powers(3) 11,264.0_______________(1)CME Clearing designates $100.0 million of corporate contributions to satisfy a clearing firm default in the event that the defaulting clearing firm's guaranty contributions and performance bonds do not satisfy the deficit. (2)Guaranty fund contributions of clearing firms include guaranty fund contributions required of clearing firms, but do not include any excess deposits held by us at the direction of clearing firms. (3)In the event of a clearing firm default, if a loss continues to exist after the utilization of the assets of the defaulted firm, our corporate contribution and the non-defaulting clearing firms' guaranty fund contributions, we would assess all non-defaulting clearing members as provided in the rules governing the guaranty fund. We could assess non-defaulting clearing members 275% of their existing guaranty fund requirements up to a maximum of 550% of their existing guaranty fund requirements as provided in the rules. Assessment powers are calculated to reflect the potential obligation that each clearing member could be called for in the event clearing member defaults exhaust the guaranty fund, however the total amount available would be reduced by the defaulted clearing members assessment obligations since they would no longer be able to satisfy their obligations.The following shows the available assets for the interest rate swap financial safeguard package at December 31, 2018 in the event of a payment default by a clearing firm that clears interest rate swap contracts, after first utilizing the defaulting firm's available assets: (in millions) CME Clearing Available AssetsDesignated corporate contributions for interest rate swap contracts(1) $150.0Guaranty fund contributions(2) 3,319.5Assessment powers(3) 1,121.9_______________(1)CME Clearing designates $150.0 million of corporate contributions to satisfy a clearing firm default in the event that the defaulting clearing firm's guaranty contributions and performance bonds do not satisfy the deficit.

(3)In the event of a clearing firm default, if a loss continues to exist after the utilization of the assets of the defaulted firm, our corporate contribution and the non-defaulting firms' guaranty fund contributions, we would assess non-defaulting clearing members as provided in the rules governing the interest rate swap guaranty fund.BrokerTec Matched Principal BusinessBrokerTec maintains a matched principal business, where it serves as a fully matched counterparty to offsetting positions entered into by clients on its electronic trading platform to facilitate anonymity and access to clearing and settlement. BrokerTec uses Fixed Income Clearing Corporation (FICC), a third-party central clearing house as well as a third-party clearing 47Table of Contentsbank for the settlement of transactions and is required to post short-term margin requirements twice a day that can vary based on the size of unsettled transactions and any adverse market changes. At December 31, 2018, the balance of the collateral at FICC was $100.0 million, which was included in other current assets on the consolidated balance sheet. Without sufficient funds to meet its obligations, BrokerTec could be exposed to risk of breach of contract with the counterparties and the inability to continue as a member of the third-party central clearing house. Transactions with clearing house members are typically confirmed and novated shortly after execution, at which point the clearing house assumes the risk of settlement. For transactions with counterparties that are not members of the clearing house, settlement typically occurs on the day following execution and, prior to settlement, BrokerTec is exposed to the risk of loss in the event a counterparty fails to meet its obligations. If that were to occur, BrokerTec would have the right to cover or liquidate the open position but could incur a loss as a result of market movements.Foreign Currency Exchange Rate RiskForeign Currency Transaction Risk We have foreign currency transaction risk related to changes in exchange rates on monetary assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses held at subsidiaries where those balances and activity are denominated in a currency other than the subsidiary's functional currency. Gains and losses on foreign currency transactions result primarily from cash, debt and other monetary assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses denominated in British pounds, euros and Japanese yen. During 2018, we maintained a restricted cash balance of $1.6 billion held for the acquisition of NEX, which was denominated in British pounds. This cash balance contributed to a significant portion of the net foreign currency transaction loss incurred in 2018.In conjunction with the acquisition, we assumed the outstanding debt of NEX on the acquisition date, which includes a €350.0 million Eurobond maturing in March 2019, a ¥19.1 billion term loan due in March 2019 and a €15.0 million fixed rate note maturing in May 2023. Since the debt is denominated in euros and Japanese yen, we have foreign currency transaction risk related to changes in these currencies until the debt is repaid. We maintain a hedge contract on the exchange rate risk between the Japanese yen and the British pound on the maturing principal and interest payments of the Japanese yen-based term loan, but we have foreign currency transaction risk between the U.S. dollar and the British pound until the Japanese yen-based term loan is repaid. We also maintain a cross-currency swap on part of the outstanding par value on our €350.0 million Eurobond maturing in March 2019, which swaps our euro-based principal and interest payments for British pound-based payments. Aggregate transaction gains (losses) for 2018, 2017 and 2016 were $(73.6) million, $9.4 million and $(24.5) million, respectively. We expect the foreign currency gain/loss to continue to fluctuate as long as we continue to hold monetary assets and liabilities at those subsidiaries. Foreign Currency Translation Risk We have foreign currency translation risk related to the translation of our foreign subsidiaries' assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses from their respective functional currencies to the U.S. dollar at each reporting date. Fluctuations in exchange rates may impact the amount of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses we report on our consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of income. The financial statements of those foreign subsidiaries with functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars using a current exchange rate. Gains and losses resulting from this translation are recognized as a foreign currency translation adjustment within accumulated other comprehensive income, which is a component of shareholders' equity and comprehensive income. Aggregate translation gains (losses), net of tax, for 2018, 2017 and 2016 were $(2.5) million, $7.5 million and $(6.9) million, respectively. Foreign Currency Exchange Risk Related to Customer CollateralA portion of performance bond deposits is denominated in various foreign currencies. We mark-to-market all deposits daily and require payment from clearing firms whose collateral has lost value due to changes in foreign currency rates and price. Therefore, our exposure to foreign currency risk related to performance bond deposits is considered minimal and is not expected to be material to our financial condition or operating results. 48Table of Contents",2023-12-30 20:16:42.925246

The following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations includes the financial results of NEX beginning on November 3, 2018.References in this discussion and analysis to “we” and “our” are to CME Group Inc. (CME Group) and its consolidated subsidiaries, collectively. References to “exchange” are to Chicago Mercantile Exchange Inc. (CME), the Board of Trade of the City of Chicago, Inc. (CBOT), New York Mercantile Exchange, Inc. (NYMEX) and Commodity Exchange, Inc. (COMEX), collectively, unless otherwise noted. EXECUTIVE SUMMARYBusiness OverviewCME Group, a Delaware stock corporation, is the holding company for CME, CBOT, NYMEX, COMEX, NEX and their respective subsidiaries. The holding company structure is designed to provide strategic and operational flexibility. CME Group's Class A common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market (NASDAQ) under the ticker symbol ""CME."" Our exchange consists of designated contract markets for the trading of futures and options contracts. We also clear futures, options and swaps contracts through our clearing house. Futures contracts, options contracts and swaps contracts provide investors with vehicles for protecting against, and potentially profiting from, price changes in financial instruments and physical commodities. We are a global company with customer access available virtually all over the world. Our customers consist of professional traders, financial institutions, individual and institutional investors, major corporations, manufacturers, producers, governments and central banks. Customers include both members of the exchange and non-members. We offer our customers the opportunity to trade futures contracts and options contracts on a range of products including those based on interest rates, equity indexes, foreign exchange, agricultural commodities, energy and metals. Through our cash markets business, we offer fixed income trading through BrokerTec and foreign currency trading through EBS. Our products provide a means for hedging, speculating and allocating assets. We identify new products by monitoring economic trends and their impact on the risk management and speculative needs of our existing and prospective customers. Most of our products are available for trading through our electronic trading platforms. These execution facilities offer our customers immediate trade execution and price transparency. In addition, trades can be executed through privately negotiated transactions that are cleared and settled through our clearing house. We also provide optimization services that deliver transaction lifecycle management and information services to help our customers optimize their capital, mitigate their risk and reduce operational costs. Optimization services includes Traiana, TriOptima and Reset.Our clearing house clears, settles and guarantees futures and options contracts traded through our exchanges, in addition to cleared swaps products. Our clearing house's performance guarantee is an important function of our business. Because of this guarantee, our customers do not need to evaluate the credit of each potential counterparty or limit themselves to a selected set of counterparties. This flexibility increases the potential liquidity available for each trade. Additionally, the substitution of our clearing house as the counterparty to every transaction allows our customers to establish a position with one party and offset the 29Table of Contentsposition with another party. This contract offsetting process provides our customers with flexibility in establishing and adjusting positions and provides for collateral and margining efficiencies. Certain BrokerTec and EBS contracts are cleared at third-party clearing houses. Business TrendsEconomic Environment. Our customers continue to use our markets as an effective and transparent means to manage risk and meet their investment needs. Trading activity in our centralized markets has fluctuated due to the ongoing uncertainty in the financial markets caused by the United States and European credit crises, fluctuations in the availability of credit, variations in the amount of assets under management as well as the Federal Reserve Bank’s interest rate policy and quantitative easing. We continue to maintain high quality and diverse products as well as various clearing and market data services which support our customers in any economic environment. Competitive Environment. Our industry is competitive and we continue to encounter competition in all aspects of our business. We expect competition to continue to intensify, especially in light of ongoing regulatory reform in the financial services industry. Competition is influenced by our brand and reputation; the efficiency and security of our settlement, clearing and support services; depth and liquidity of our markets; diversity of product offerings including frequency and quality of new product development and innovative services; our ability to position and expand upon existing products to address changing market needs; efficient and seamless customer experience; transparency, reliability, anonymity and security of transaction processing; the regulatory environment; connectivity, accessibility, flexibility in execution methods and distribution; technology capability and innovation, as well as overall transaction costs. We believe we are very well positioned with respect to these factors. Our asset classes contain products designed to address differing risk management needs, and customers are able to achieve operational and capital efficiencies by accessing our diverse products through our platforms and our clearing house. We face competition from other futures, securities and securities option exchanges; clearing organizations; swap execution facilities; alternative trade execution facilities; technology firms, including market data distributors and electronic trading system developers; and others. As markets continue to evolve, we will continue to adapt our trading technology and clearing services to meet the needs of our customers. The competitive environment to which we are subject is discussed in ""Item 1. Business"" on page 9.Regulatory Environment. Exchange-traded derivatives have historically been subject to extensive regulation. Developments in the regulatory environment have the potential to significantly impact our business. Compliance with regulations may require us and our customers to dedicate significant financial and operational resources which could adversely affect our profitability. The regulatory environment to which we are subject is discussed in ""Item 1. Business"" on page 10.Business StrategyOur strategy focuses on maximizing futures and options growth globally, diversifying our business and revenues, and delivering unparalleled customer efficiencies and operational excellence. This strategy allows us to continue to develop into a more broadly diversified financial exchange that provides trading and clearing solutions across a wide range of products and asset classes. Our strategic initiatives are discussed in ""Item 1. Business"" on page 7. RevenuesClearing and transaction fees. A majority of our revenue is derived from clearing and transaction fees, which include electronic trading fees, surcharges for privately negotiated transactions and other volume-related charges for exchange-traded and over-the-counter contracts. Because clearing and transaction fees are assessed on a per-contract or notional value basis, revenues and profitability fluctuate with changes in contract volume. In addition to the business trends noted earlier, our contract volume, and consequently our revenues, tend to increase during periods of economic and geopolitical uncertainty as our customers seek to manage their exposure to, or speculate on, the market volatility resulting from that uncertainty. While volume has the most significant impact on our clearing and transaction fees revenue, there are four other factors that also influence this source of revenue: •rate structure;•product mix;•venue, and•the percentage of trades executed by customers who are members compared with non-member customers.Rate structure. Customers benefit from volume discounts and limits on fees as part of our effort to increase liquidity in certain products. We offer various incentive programs to promote trading and clearing in various products and geographic locations. 30Table of ContentsWe may periodically change fees, volume discounts, fee limits and member discounts, perhaps significantly, based on our review of operations and the business environment. Product mix. We offer exchange-traded futures and options contracts as well as cleared-only interest rate swap contracts. Through our acquisition of NEX, we also offer foreign exchange spot and forward contracts and fixed income products. Rates are varied by product in order to optimize revenue on existing products and to encourage contract volume upon introduction of new products. Venue. Our exchange and platforms are an international marketplace that brings together buyers and sellers mainly through our electronic trading as well as through open outcry trading and privately negotiated transactions. Any customer who is guaranteed by a clearing firm and who agrees to be bound by our exchange rules is able to obtain direct access to our CME electronic platforms. Open outcry trading is conducted exclusively by our members, who may execute trades on behalf of customers or for themselves. Typically, customers submitting trades through our electronic platforms are charged fees for using the platforms in addition to the fees assessed on all transactions executed on our exchange. Customers entering into privately negotiated transactions also incur additional charges beyond the fees assessed on other transactions. Member/non-member mix. Generally, member customers are charged lower fees than our non-member customers. Holding all other factors constant, revenue decreases if the percentage of trades executed by members increases, and increases if the percentage of non-member trades increases. Clearing and transaction fees for cash markets business. Our cash markets business provides matching services whereby we match a buyer and seller of financial instruments to allow both parties to complete the trade bilaterally or through a third-party clearing house. We are not involved in the settlement of the contract but charge a transaction fee generally based on volume or notional value of the trade for providing the matching service. The cash markets business also includes BrokerTec Americas, which generates revenue from a matched principal business. This business serves as a fully matched counterparty to offsetting positions entered into by clients on its electronic trading platform to facilitate anonymity and access to clearing and settlement. Revenue is generated from this business generally on a transaction fee basis. Other sources. Revenue is also derived from other sources including market data and information services and other various services related to our exchange operations. Market data and information services. We receive market data and information services revenue from the dissemination of our market data to subscribers. Subscribers can obtain access to our market data services either directly or through third party distributors. Our service offerings include access to real-time, delayed and end-of-day quotations, trade and summary market data for our products and other data sources. Users of our basic service receive real-time quotes and pay a flat monthly fee for each screen, or device, displaying our market data. Alternatively, customers can subscribe to market data provided on a limited group of products. The fee for this service is also a flat rate per month.Pricing for our market data services is based on the value of the service provided and the price of comparable services offered by our competitors. Increases or decreases in our market data and information services revenue are influenced by changes in our price structure and incentive programs for existing market data offerings, introduction of new market data services and changes in the number of devices in use. General economic factors that affect the financial services industry, which constitutes our primary customer base, also influence revenue from our market data services. Other revenues. Other revenue includes access and communication fees. Access and communication fees are connectivity fees charged to members and clearing firms that utilize our various telecommunications networks and communications services. Our communication services include our co-location program as well as the connectivity charges to customers of the CME Globex platform. Access fee revenue varies depending on the type of connection provided to customers. Other revenues include revenues from our optimization services, which include fees for risk management and information services for the over-the-counter markets, including portfolio reconciliation and post-trade processing. Revenue earned from these services is typically generated through subscriptions or transaction fees. Other revenues also include fees for post-trade services, fees for collateral management, equity subscription fees and fees for trade order routing through agreements from various strategic relationships as well as other services to members and clearing firms. 31Table of ContentsExpensesThe majority of our expenses do not vary directly with changes in our contract volume. However, licensing and other fee agreements can vary directly with certain equity, energy and swap volumes as well as the majority of our employee bonuses vary directly with overall contract volume. Compensation and benefits. Compensation and benefits expense is our most significant expense and includes employee wages, bonuses, stock-based compensation, benefits and employer taxes. Changes in this expense are driven by fluctuations in the number of employees, increases in wages as a result of inflation or labor market conditions, changes in rates for employer taxes and other cost increases affecting benefit plans. In addition, this expense is affected by the composition of our workforce. The expense associated with our bonus and stock-based compensation plans can also have a significant impact on this expense category. The bonus component of our compensation and benefits expense is based on our financial performance. Under the performance criteria of our annual incentive plans, the bonus funded under the plans is based on achieving certain financial performance targets established by the compensation committee of our board of directors. The compensation committee has discretion to make equitable adjustments to the cash earnings performance calculation to reflect effects of unplanned operating results or capital expenditures to meet intermediate- to long-term growth opportunities. In general, stock-based compensation is a non-cash expense related to restricted stock and performance share grants. Stock-based compensation varies depending on the quantity and fair value of awards granted. The fair value of restricted stock awards and other performance share grants is based on either the share price on the date of the grant or a model of expected future stock prices. Professional fees and outside services. This expense includes fees for consulting services received on strategic and technology initiatives; regulatory and other compliance matters; temporary labor as well as legal and accounting fees. This expense may fluctuate as a result of changes in services required to complete initiatives, handle legal proceedings and comply with regulatory and compliance requirements.Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense results from the depreciation of long-lived assets such as buildings, leasehold improvements, furniture, fixtures and equipment. This expense also includes the amortization of purchased and internally developed software. Amortization of purchased intangibles. Amortization of purchased intangibles includes amortization of intangible assets obtained in our acquisitions of CBOT Holdings, Inc., NYMEX Holdings, Inc. and NEX as well as other asset and business acquisitions. Intangible assets subject to amortization consist primarily of clearing firm, market data and other customer relationships. Other expenses. We incur additional ongoing expenses for communications, technology support services and various other activities necessary to support our operations. •Technology expense consists of costs related to maintenance of the hardware and software required to support our technology. It also includes costs for network connections for our electronic platforms and some market data customers; telecommunications costs of our exchange, and fees paid for access to external market data. This expense may be driven by system capacity, functionality and redundancy requirements. It also may be impacted by growth in electronic contract volume and changes in the number of telecommunications hubs and connections which allow customers outside the United States to access our electronic platforms directly. •Licensing and other fee agreements expense includes license fees paid as a result of contract volume in equity index products. This expense also includes royalty fees and broker rebates on energy and metals products as well as revenue sharing on cleared swaps contracts and some new product launches. This expense fluctuates with changes in contract volumes as well as changes in fee structures. •Other expenses include occupancy and building operations expenses including rent, maintenance, real estate taxes, utilities and other related costs related to leased property in Chicago, New York, the United Kingdom, India as well as other smaller locations throughout the world. Other expenses also include marketing and travel-related expenses as well as general and administrative costs. Marketing, advertising and public relations expense includes media, print and other advertising costs, as well as costs associated with our product promotion. Other expenses also include litigation and customer settlements, impairment charges on operating assets, gains and losses on disposals of certain operating assets, and foreign currency transaction gains and losses resulting from changes in exchange rates on certain foreign monetary assets and liabilities. 32Table of ContentsNon-Operating Income and ExpensesIncome and expenses incurred through activities outside of our core operations are considered non-operating. These activities include non-core investing and financing activities. •Investment income includes income from short-term investment of clearing firms' cash performance bonds and guaranty fund contributions as well as excess operating cash; interest income and realized gains and losses from our marketable securities; realized gains and losses as well as dividend income from our strategic equity investments, and gains and losses on trading securities in our non-qualified deferred compensation plans. Investment income is influenced by market interest rates, changes in the levels of cash performance bonds deposited by clearing firms, the amount of dividends distributed by our strategic investments and the availability of funds generated by operations. •Interest and other borrowing costs expense includes charges associated with various short-term and long-term funding facilities, including commitment fees on lines of credit agreements.•Equity in net earnings (losses) of unconsolidated subsidiaries includes income and losses from our investments in S&P/Dow Jones Indices LLC (S&P/DJI), Dubai Mercantile Exchange and Bursa Malaysia Derivatives Berhad.•Other income (expense) includes expenses related to the distribution of a portion of interest earned on performance bond collateral reinvestment to the clearing firms, gains and losses on derivative contracts as well as other various income and expenses outside our core operations.CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIESThe notes to our consolidated financial statements include disclosure of our significant accounting policies. In establishing these policies within the framework of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, management must make certain assessments, estimates and choices that will result in the application of these principles in a manner that appropriately reflects our financial condition and results of operations. Critical accounting policies are those policies that we believe present the most complex or subjective measurements and have the most potential to affect our financial position and operating results. While all decisions regarding accounting policies are important, there are certain accounting policies that we consider to be critical. These critical policies, which are presented in detail in the notes to our consolidated financial statements, relate to the valuation of financial instruments, goodwill and intangible assets, revenue recognition, income taxes and internal use software costs. Valuation of financial instruments. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, or an exit price. We have categorized financial instruments measured at fair value into the following three-level fair value hierarchy based upon the level of judgment associated with the inputs used to measure the fair value: •Level 1—Inputs are unadjusted, quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date. •Level 2— Inputs consist of observable market data, other than level 1 inputs, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs other than quoted prices that are directly observable. •Level 3—Inputs are unobservable and reflect management’s best estimate of what market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. Assets and liabilities carried at level 3 fair value generally include assets and liabilities with inputs that require management’s judgment.For further discussion regarding the fair value of financial assets and liabilities, see note 19 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Goodwill and intangible assets. We review goodwill for impairment on a quarterly basis and whenever events or circumstances indicate that its carrying value may not be recoverable. Goodwill may be tested quantitatively for impairment by comparing the carrying value of a reporting unit to its estimated fair value. Estimating the fair value of a reporting unit involves the use of valuation techniques that rely on significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions may include forecasted revenue growth rates; forecasted operating margins; risk-adjusted discount rates; forecasted economic and market conditions, and industry multiples. We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable given the information that is available to us at the time of our assessment; however, actual future results may differ significantly from those estimates. Under certain favorable circumstances, goodwill may be reviewed qualitatively for indications of impairment without utilizing valuation techniques to estimate fair value. The qualitative assessment of goodwill may rely on significant assumptions about forecasts of revenue growth, operating margins and economic conditions as well as overall market and industry-specific trends. We also review indefinite-lived intangible assets on a quarterly basis or more frequently when events and circumstances indicate that their carrying values may not be recoverable. Indefinite-lived intangible assets may be tested quantitatively for 33Table of Contentsimpairment by comparing their carrying values to their estimated fair values. Estimating the fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets involves the use of valuation techniques that rely on significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions may include forecasted revenue growth rates, forecasted allocations of expense and risk-adjusted discount rates. We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable given the information that is available to us at the time of our assessment; however, actual future results may differ significantly from those estimates. Similar to goodwill, under certain favorable circumstances, indefinite-lived intangible assets may be reviewed qualitatively for indications of impairment without utilizing valuation techniques to estimate fair value. The qualitative assessment of indefinite-lived intangible assets may rely on significant assumptions about forecasts of revenue growth, operating margins and economic conditions as well as overall market and industry-specific trends.Intangible assets subject to amortization are also assessed for impairment on a quarterly basis or more frequently when indicated by a change in economic or operational circumstances. The impairment assessment of these assets requires management to first compare the book value of the amortizing asset to undiscounted cash flows. If the book value exceeds the undiscounted cash flows, management is then required to estimate the fair value of the assets and record an impairment loss for the excess of the carrying value over the fair value and annually challenge the useful lives. Revenue recognition. A significant portion of our revenue is derived from the clearing and transaction fees we assess on each contract executed through our trading venues and cleared through our clearing house. Clearing and transaction fees are recognized as revenue when a buy and sell order are matched and when the trade is cleared. On occasion, the customer's exchange trading privileges may not be properly entered by the clearinrg firm and incorrect fees are charged for the transactions in the affected accounts. When this information is corrected within the time period allowed by the exchange, a fee adjustment is provided to the clearing firm. An accrual is established for estimated fee adjustments to reflect corrections to customer exchange trading privileges. The accrual is based on the historical pattern of adjustments processed as well as specific adjustment requests.Income taxes. Calculation of the income tax provision includes an estimate of the income taxes that will be paid for the current year as well as an estimate of income tax liabilities or benefits deferred into future years. Deferred tax assets are reviewed to determine if they will be realized in future periods. To the extent it is determined that some deferred tax assets may not be fully realized, the assets are reduced to their realizable value by a valuation allowance. The calculation of our tax provision involves uncertainty in the application of complex tax regulations and we occasionally may consult with relevant tax authorities or engage third party expertise where appropriate. We recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the United States and other applicable foreign tax jurisdictions using a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold based on the technical merits of the tax position taken or expected to be taken. If the actual obligation of these amounts varies from our estimate, our income tax provision would be reduced or increased at the time that determination is made. This determination may not be known for several years. Past tax audits have not resulted in tax adjustments that resulted in a material change to the income tax provision in the year the audit was completed. The effective tax rate, defined as the income tax provision as a percentage of income before income taxes, will vary from year to year based on changes in tax jurisdictions, tax rates and regulations. In addition, the effective tax rate will vary with changes to income that are not subject to income tax and changes in expenses or losses that are not deductible, such as the utilization of foreign net operating losses. Internal use software costs. Certain internal and external costs that are incurred in connection with developing or obtaining computer software for internal use are capitalized. We also enter into software hosting arrangements for software projects maintained in the cloud. Software development costs incurred during the planning or maintenance stages of a software project are expensed as incurred, while costs incurred during the application development stage are capitalized and are amortized over the estimated useful life of the software, generally two to four years. Amortization of capitalized costs begins only when the software becomes ready for its intended use. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTSRefer to note 2 in our notes to the consolidated financial statements for information on newly adopted and recently issued accounting pronouncements that are applicable to us. 34Table of ContentsRESULTS OF OPERATIONSFinancial HighlightsThe following summarizes significant changes in our financial performance for the years presented. For a comparison of our results of operations for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2018 and December 2017, see ""Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations"" of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 filed with the SEC on February 28, 2019.

Total contract volume includes contracts that are traded on our exchange and cleared through our clearing house and certain cleared-only contracts. Volume is measured in round turns, which is considered a completed transaction that involves a purchase and an offsetting sale of a contract. Average rate per contract is determined by dividing total clearing and transaction fees by total contract volume. Contract volume and average rate per contract disclosures below exclude trading volume for the cash markets business as well as interest rate swaps.

Due to the relationship between average rate per contract and contract volume, the change in clearing and transaction fees attributable to changes in each is only an approximation.Contract VolumeThe following table summarizes average daily contract volume. Contract volume can be influenced by many factors, including political and economic factors, the regulatory environment and market competition. Year-over-Year Change(amounts in thousands) 2019 2018 2019-2018Average Daily Volume by Product Line: Interest rates 10,349 9,951 4 %Equity indexes 3,459 3,589 (4)Foreign exchange 862 1,004 (14)Agricultural commodities 1,454 1,480 (2)Energy 2,375 2,561 (7)Metals 668 639 5Aggregate average daily volume 19,167 19,224 — Average Daily Volume by Venue: CME Globex 17,182 17,371 (1)Open outcry 1,205 1,168 3Privately negotiated 780 685 14Aggregate average daily volume 19,167 19,224 —Electronic Volume as a Percentage of Total Volume 90% 90% During 2019, volatility spiked in mid-2019 following a shift in expectations surrounding the Federal Reserve's interest rate policies. In mid-2019, the Federal Reserve began cutting interest rates following earlier indications that it intended to continue to slowly increase interest rates throughout 2019. Uncertainty surrounding the United States' foreign trade policy also increased mid-2019 following the threat of additional tariffs. By the fourth quarter, market volatility generally declined as uncertainty surrounding the Federal Reserve's interest rate policy subsided. Uncertainty surrounding the foreign trade policy also diminished following a preliminary trade agreement between the United States and China at the end of 2019. We believe the net result of these factors lead to overall volume remaining relatively flat in 2019 when compared with 2018.Interest Rate ProductsThe following table summarizes average daily contract volume for our key interest rate products. Eurodollar front 8 contracts include contracts expiring within two years. Eurodollar back 32 contracts include contracts expiring within three to ten years.

We believe volatility increased in the middle of 2019 due to a shift in market expectations at that time following the Federal Reserve's decision to initiate interest rate cuts as well as uncertainty surrounding the United State's future economic growth.Equity Index ProductsThe following table summarizes average daily contract volume for our key equity index products. Volume below for the year ended 2019 includes Micro-E-mini contract volumes for each index beginning on May 6, 2019, which was the date the contracts were launched. Year-over-Year Change(amounts in thousands) 2019 2018 2019-2018E-mini S&P 500 futures and options 2,338 2,527 (7)%E-mini NASDAQ 100 futures and options 592 504 17E-mini Russell 2000 futures and options 168 153 10In 2019 compared with 2018, equity index contract volume decreased slightly due to lower overall volatility in the equity market in 2019, particularly in the fourth quarter. Volatility levels were higher in 2018 due to uncertainty surrounding the United States' foreign trade and other economic policies; however, the volatility leveled off at the end of 2019. The overall decrease in volume was partially offset by additional volume generated from the launch of Micro-E-mini equity index contracts in the second quarter of 2019, which have a notional size of one-tenth of the traditional E-mini contracts. Average daily contract volume in 2019 included approximately 317,000 in Micro-E-mini equity index contracts. Foreign Exchange ProductsThe following table summarizes average daily contract volume for our key foreign exchange products. Year-over-Year Change(amounts in thousands) 2019 2018 2019-2018Euro 232 308 (25)%Japanese yen 139 159 (13)British pound 129 142 (9)Australian dollar 105 118 (11)In 2019 compared with 2018, overall foreign exchange contract volume decreased, which we believe resulted from lower overall volatility following periods of higher volatility in early 2018. We believe foreign exchange volatility decreased in 2019 following the indication by the Federal Reserve and other central banks to limit the number of interest rate changes in 2019. We also believe that the lack of a final resolution of a trade agreement between the United States and China and the delay in the United Kingdom European Union membership referendum contributed to lower volume. Agricultural Commodity ProductsThe following table summarizes average daily volume for our key agricultural commodity products. Year-over-Year Change(amounts in thousands) 2019 2018 2019-2018Corn 525 482 9 %Soybean 263 305 (14)Wheat 215 248 (13)Overall commodity contract volume decreased slightly in 2019 when compared with 2018. We believe the decline in soybean contract volume was due to lower U.S. exports of soybeans to China due to uncertainty surrounding trade policies between the countries. The decrease in wheat contract volume was due to lower volatility levels resulting from a surplus of global supplies in major growing regions around the world. Corn contract volume increased due to significant uncertainty surrounding crop yields for the 2019 growing season due to higher than normal precipitation levels. 37Table of ContentsEnergy ProductsThe following table summarizes average daily volume for our key energy products.

In addition, expanded production of natural gas resulted in a reduction of price volatility in early 2019, which we believe contributed to a decrease in natural gas volume.Metal ProductsThe following table summarizes average daily volume for our key metal products. Year-over-Year Change(amounts in thousands) 2019 2018 2019-2018Gold 433 375 16 %Silver 107 103 3Copper 98 131 (25)Overall metal contract volume increased in 2019 when compared with 2018 due to an increase in metals price volatility caused by investors using gold and other precious metals as safe-haven alternative investments to other volatile markets, particularly in mid-2019. Average Rate per ContractThe average rate per contract decreased in 2019 when compared with 2018, which is largely due to a shift in product mix. Interest rate contract volume increased by 2 percentage points as a percent of total volume, while all other products collectively decreased by 2 percentage points. In general, interest rate products have a lower rate per contract compared with the remaining contracts. The decrease in average rate per contract was also due to the introduction of the micro-E-mini equity index contracts, which have a lower average rate per contract compared with a standard E-mini contract. Micro-E-mini equity index contracts have a notional size of one-tenth of the traditional E-mini contracts.Cash Markets BusinessTotal clearing and transaction fees revenue in 2019 includes $483.0 million of transaction fees attributable to the cash markets business acquired from NEX compared with $91.2 million for the period November 3, 2018 through December 31, 2018. This revenue primarily includes BrokerTec Americas' fixed income volume and EBS foreign exchange volume.(amounts in millions) 2019 2018BrokerTec Americas' fixed income transaction fees $191.5 $32.9EBS foreign exchange transaction fees 191.8 37.5The related average daily notional value for the year ended 2019 and the period November 3, 2018 through December 31, 2018 were as follows:(amounts in billions) 2019 2018U.S. Treasury $164.8 $187.2European Repo (in euros) 269.6 253.6Spot FX 75.1 79.0 38Table of ContentsConcentration of RevenueWe bill a significant portion of our clearing and transaction fees to our clearing firms. The majority of clearing and transaction fees received from clearing firms represent charges for trades executed and cleared on behalf of their customers. No individual clearing firm represented at least 10% of our clearing and transaction fees in 2019. Should a clearing firm withdraw, we believe that the customer portion of the firm's trading activity would likely transfer to another clearing firm of the exchange. Therefore, we do not believe we are exposed to significant risk from an ongoing loss of revenue received from or through a particular clearing firm. Other Sources of RevenueMarket data and information services. In 2019 when compared with 2018, the increase in market data and information services revenue was attributable to the additional market data revenue generated by market data subscribers and distributors associated with the cash markets business subsequent to the NEX acquisition in November 2018. In addition, fees for legacy CME basic real-time market data services increased to $105 per month from $85 per month for each device beginning in the second quarter of 2018, which also contributed to the increase in revenue in 2019 compared with 2018. The increase was partially offset by a reduction in revenue due to modest declines in screen counts due to cost-cutting initiatives at member firms.The two largest resellers of our market data represented, in aggregate, 37% of our market data and information services revenue in 2019. Despite this concentration, we consider exposure to significant risk of revenue loss to be minimal. In the event that one of these vendors no longer subscribes to our market data, we believe the majority of that vendor's customers would likely subscribe to our market data through another reseller. Additionally, several of our largest institutional customers that utilize services from our two largest resellers report usage and remit payment of their fees directly to us.Other revenues. The increase in other revenues in 2019 when compared with 2018 is largely attributable to the additional other revenue contributed by the NEX acquisition. Other revenues from NEX primarily include optimization services such as portfolio management, analytics, and trade and regulatory reporting.Expenses Year-over-Year Change(dollars in millions) 2019 2018 2019-2018Compensation and benefits $898.7 $672.2 34%Technology 201.5 117.2 72Professional fees and outside services 174.1 166.1 5Amortization of purchased intangibles 314.7 130.0 142Depreciation and amortization 158.6 118.7 34Licensing and other fee agreements 172.2 170.6 1Other 360.4 327.0 10Total Expenses $2,280.2 $1,701.8 34 39Table of Contents2019 Compared With 2018Operating expenses increased by $578.4 million in 2019 when compared with 2018.

These costs primarily consisted of professional and legal fees incurred to support the post-acquisition integration efforts during 2019. Decreases in operating expenses in 2019 when compared with 2018 were as follows:•In 2018, we recognized a net loss of $73.6 million primarily due to the decline in the British pound versus U.S. dollar exchange rate on $1.6 billion of restricted cash held for the acquisition of NEX, which was denominated in British pounds, compared to a net loss of $7.2 million in 2019. Gains and losses from exchange rate fluctuations result when subsidiaries with a U.S. dollar functional currency hold cash as well as certain other monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies.•Transaction costs and transfer taxes incurred by CME Group related to the NEX acquisition resulted in additional expense in 2018.

The decrease in investment income in 2019 when compared with 2018 was largely due to a decline in net realized and unrealized gains (losses). The decrease in investment income was also due to a decline in earnings from cash performance bond and guaranty fund contributions that are reinvested, which primarily resulted from lower average reinvestment balances as well as an overall decrease in the rate of return earned on our investments. Interest and other borrowing costs. Interest and other borrowing costs were higher in 2019 compared with 2018 due to a full year of interest expense incurred on $500.0 million of 3.75% fixed rate notes due June 2028 and $700.0 million of 4.15% fixed rate notes due June 2048 issued in the second quarter of 2018.Equity in net earnings (losses) of unconsolidated subsidiaries. Higher income generated from our S&P/DJI business venture and net earnings from investments acquired through the transaction with NEX contributed to increases in equity in net earnings (losses) of unconsolidated subsidiaries in 2019 when compared with the prior year.Other income (expense). In 2019 when compared with 2018, we recognized lower net losses on various derivative contracts. In 2018, we recognized net losses on our foreign exchange option and forward contracts used to mitigate certain exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuation on the currency required to facilitate the NEX acquisition as well as derivative contracts that we assumed in our acquisition of NEX. Expense related to the redistribution of income earned on performance bond and guaranty fund contributions was relatively flat in 2019 compared to 2018.Income Tax ProvisionThe following table summarizes the effective tax rate for the periods presented: 2019 2018 Year-over-Year Change2019-2018Year ended December 3121.3% 29.3% (8.0)%In 2019 when compared with 2018, the effective tax rate was lower due to the recognition of benefits from the Internal Revenue Code Section 250 deduction in 2019. Proposed FDII Deduction regulations were released in 2019 and as a result, we have revised our income tax calculations to reflect the proposed guidance. The benefit recognized in 2019 includes estimates for the deduction for 2018 and 2019. In addition, we recognized higher deferred tax expense in 2018 due to the acquisition of NEX. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESCash RequirementsWe have historically met our funding requirements with cash generated by our ongoing operations. However, as part of the funding for the NEX acquisition, we utilized our commercial paper program in late 2018 and throughout 2019 for short-term funding requirements. While our cost structure is fixed in the short term, our sources of operating cash are largely dependent on contract trading volume levels. In addition to using our existing cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and cash generated from operations, we may continue to utilize our commercial paper program to meet our working capital needs, capital expenditures and other commitments. It is also possible that we may need to raise additional funds to finance our activities through future public debt offerings or by direct borrowings from financial institutions through our committed revolving credit facilities.Cash will also be required for operating leases and non-cancellable purchase obligations as well as other obligations reflected as long-term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2019. These were as follows: (in millions) Leases PurchaseObligations Debt Obligations OtherLong-TermLiabilities (1) TotalYear 2020 $80.7 $25.3 $133.3 $— $239.32021-2022 159.9 24.4 1,016.5 — 1,200.82023-2024 150.4 8.0 237.6 — 396.0Thereafter 510.5 — 4,214.8 — 4,725.3Total $901.5 $57.7 $5,602.2 $— $6,561.4 _______________(1)The liability for gross unrecognized income tax benefits, including interest and penalties, of $441.8 million for uncertain tax positions is not included in the table due to uncertainty about the date of their settlement. It also excludes liabilities for lease 41Table of Contentsarrangements as well as liabilities that have uncertainty associated with timing of payments, including liabilities for benefit plans. It also excludes liabilities that will not be settled in cash. Leases include rent payments for office space in Chicago, New York and other smaller offices in the United States and in various foreign countries. The lease for our headquarters in Chicago expires in 2032. Annual minimum rental payments under this lease range from $14.0 million to $19.7 million. We also maintain leases for datacenter space in the Chicago area, which expires in March 2031. Annual minimum rental payments under this lease range from $16.9 million to $18.3 million. The lease for our office space in New York expires in December 2028. Annual minimum rental payments under this lease range from $14.3 million to $15.3 million. Purchase obligations include minimum payments due under agreements for advertising, licensing, hardware, software and maintenance as well as telecommunication services. Debt obligations include repayment of principal and interest associated with the debt obligations. Future capital expenditures for technology are anticipated as we continue to support our growth through increased system capacity, performance improvements, integration of acquired platforms as well as improvements to some of our office spaces. Each year, capital expenditures are incurred for improvements to and expansion of our offices, remote data centers, telecommunications network and other operating equipment. In 2020, we expect capital expenditures to total approximately $180 million to $200 million, net of any leasehold improvement allowances and any one-time costs associated with the NEX integration. We continue to monitor our capital needs and may revise our forecasted expenditures as necessary in the future. We intend to continue to pay a regular quarterly dividend to our shareholders, with a target of between 50% to 60% of the prior year's cash earnings. The decision to pay a dividend and the amount of the dividend; however, remains within the discretion of our board of directors and may be affected by various factors, including our earnings, financial condition, capital requirements, levels of indebtedness and other considerations our board of directors deems relevant. CME Group is also required to comply with restrictions contained in the general corporation laws of its state of incorporation, which could also limit its ability to declare and pay dividends. On February 5, 2020 the board of directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.85 per share. The dividend will be payable on March 25, 2020 to shareholders of record on March 10, 2020. Assuming no changes in the number of shares outstanding, the first quarter dividend payment will total approximately $300 million. The board of directors also declared an additional, annual variable dividend of $2.50 per share on December 11, 2019 paid on January 15, 2020 to the shareholders of record on December 27, 2019. In general, the amount of the annual variable dividend will be determined by the end of each year, and the level will increase or decrease from year to year based on operating results, capitalization expenditures, potential merger and acquisition activity and other forms of capital return including regular dividends and share buybacks during the prior year. Sources and Uses of CashThe following is a summary of cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities.

Investing activitiesThe decrease in cash used in investing activities in 2019 when compared with 2018 was largely due to the cash consideration required for the acquisition of NEX in November 2018, net of cash received.Financing activitiesCash used in financing activities was higher in 2019 when compared with in 2018 due to a net reduction in outstanding debt in 2019 compared with issuance of debt in 2018. The increase in cash used in financing activities was partially offset by a decrease in cash dividends. 42Table of ContentsDebt InstrumentsThe following table summarizes our debt outstanding as of December 31, 2019: (in millions)Par ValueFixed rate notes due September 2022, stated rate of 3.00% (1)$750.0Fixed rate notes due May 2023, stated rate of 4.30%€15.0Fixed rate notes due March 2025, stated rate of 3.00% (2)$750.0Fixed rate notes due June 2028, stated rate of 3.75%$500.0Fixed rate notes due September 2043, stated rate of 5.30% (3)$750.0Fixed rate notes due June 2048, stated rate of 4.15%$700.0Commercial Paper$304.0 _______________(1)We maintained a forward-starting interest rate swap agreement that modified the interest obligation associated with these notes so that the interest payable on the notes effectively became fixed at a rate of 3.32%.(2)We maintained a forward-starting interest rate swap agreement that modified the interest obligation associated with these notes so that the interest payable on the notes effectively became fixed at a rate of 3.11%.(3)We maintained a forward-starting interest rate swap agreement that modified the interest obligation associated with these notes so that the interest payable effectively became fixed at a rate of 4.73%.We maintain a $2.4 billion multi-currency revolving senior credit facility with various financial institutions, which matures in November 2022. The proceeds from this facility can be used for general corporate purposes, which includes providing liquidity for our clearing house in certain circumstances at CME Group's discretion and, if necessary, for maturities of commercial paper. As long as we are not in default under this facility, we have the option to increase it up to $3.0 billion with the consent of the agent and lenders providing the additional funds. This facility is voluntarily pre-payable from time to time without premium or penalty. Under this facility, we are required to remain in compliance with a consolidated net worth test, which is defined as our consolidated shareholders' equity at September 30, 2017, giving effect to share repurchases made and special dividends paid during the term of the agreements (and in no event greater than $2.0 billion in aggregate), multiplied by 0.65. We currently do not have any borrowings outstanding under this facility, but the outstanding commercial paper balance is backstopped against this facility. We maintain a 364-day multi-currency revolving secured credit facility with a consortium of domestic and international banks to be used in certain situations by CME Clearing. The facility provides for borrowings of up to $7.0 billion. We may use the proceeds to provide temporary liquidity in the unlikely event of a clearing firm default, in the event of a liquidity constraint or default by a depositary (custodian for our collateral), or in the event of a temporary disruption with the domestic payments system that would delay payment of settlement variation between us and our clearing firms. Clearing firm guaranty fund contributions received in the form of cash or U.S. Treasury securities as well as the performance bond assets of a defaulting firm can be used to collateralize the facility. At December 31, 2019, guaranty funds available to collateralize the facility totaled $8.5 billion. We have the option to request an increase in the line from $7.0 billion to $10.0 billion. Our 364-day facility contains a requirement that CME remain in compliance with a consolidated tangible net worth test, defined as CME consolidated shareholder's equity less intangible assets (as defined in the agreement), of not less than $800.0 million. We currently do not have any borrowings outstanding under this facility. On May 1, 2019, we amended and extended the agreement, which will expire on April 29, 2020. The indentures governing our fixed rate notes, our $2.4 billion multi-currency revolving senior credit facility and our 364-day multi-currency revolving secured credit facility for $7.0 billion do not contain specific covenants that restrict the ability to pay dividends. These documents, however, do contain other customary financial and operating covenants that place restrictions on the operations of the company that could indirectly affect the ability to pay dividends. At December 31, 2019, we have excess borrowing capacity for general corporate purposes of approximately $2.1 billion under our multi-currency revolving senior credit facility. At December 31, 2019, we were in compliance with the various covenant requirements of all our debt facilities. CME Group, as a holding company, has no operations of its own. Instead, it relies on dividends declared and paid to it by its subsidiaries in order to provide a portion of the funds which it uses to pay dividends to its shareholders. 43Table of ContentsTo satisfy our performance bond obligation with Singapore Exchange Limited, we may pledge CME-owned U.S. Treasury securities or U.S. dollars in lieu of, or in combination with, irrevocable letters of credit. At December 31, 2019, we had pledged letters of credit totaling $260.0 million. The following table summarizes our credit ratings as of December 31, 2019: Rating Agency Short-TermDebt Rating Long-TermDebt Rating OutlookStandard & Poor’s A1+ AA- StableMoody’s Investors Service P1 Aa3 StableGiven our cash flow generation, our ability to pay down debt levels and our ability to refinance existing debt facilities, if necessary, we expect to maintain an investment grade rating. If our ratings are downgraded below investment grade due to a change of control, we are required to make an offer to repurchase our CME Group fixed rate notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsAs of December 31, 2019, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined by Securities and Exchange Commission rules and regulations.Liquidity and Cash ManagementCash and cash equivalents totaled $1.6 billion at December 31, 2019 and $1.4 billion at December 31, 2018. The balance retained in cash and cash equivalents is a function of anticipated or possible short-term cash needs, prevailing interest rates, our investment policy and alternative investment choices. A majority of our cash and cash equivalents balance is invested in money market mutual funds that invest only in U.S. Treasury securities, U.S. government agency securities and U.S. Treasury security reverse repurchase agreements. Our exposure to credit and liquidity risk is minimal given the nature of the investments. Cash that is not available for general corporate purposes because of regulatory requirements or other restrictions is classified as restricted cash and is included in other current assets or other assets on the consolidated balance sheets.Our practice is to have our pension plan 100% funded at each year end on a projected benefit obligation basis, while also satisfying any minimum required contribution and obtaining the maximum tax deduction. Based on our actuarial projections, we estimate that no contribution will be necessary in 2020 as we exceeded our funding goal by $32.7 million in 2019. However, the amount of the actual contribution is contingent on various factors, including the actual rate of return on our plan assets during 2020 and the December 31, 2020 discount rate. Regulatory Requirements CME is regulated by the CFTC as a U.S. Derivatives Clearing Organization (DCO). DCOs are required to maintain capital, as defined by the CFTC, in an amount at least equal to one year of projected operating expenses as well as cash, liquid securities, or a line of credit at least equal to six months of projected operating expenses. CME was designated by the Financial Stability Oversight Council as a systemically important financial market utility under Title VIII of Dodd-Frank. As a result, CME must comply with CFTC regulations applicable to a systemically important DCO for financial resources and liquidity resources. CME is in compliance with all DCO financial requirements.CME, CBOT, NYMEX and COMEX are regulated by the CFTC as Designated Contract Markets (DCM). DCMs are required to maintain capital, as defined by the CFTC, in an amount at least equal to one year of projected operating expenses as well as cash, liquid securities or a line of credit at least equal to six months of projected operating expenses. Our DCMs are in compliance with all DCM financial requirements. BrokerTec Americas LLC is required to maintain sufficient net capital under Securities Exchange Act Rule 15c3-1 (the Net Capital Rule). The Net Capital Rule focuses on liquidity and is designed to protect securities customers, counterparties, and creditors by requiring that broker-dealers have sufficient liquid resources on hand at all times to satisfy claims promptly. Rule 15c3-3, or the customer protection rule, which complements rule 15c3-1, is designed to ensure that customer property (securities and funds) in the custody of broker-dealers is adequately safeguarded. By law, both of these rules apply to the activities of registered broker-dealers, but not to unregistered affiliates. The firm began operating as a (k)(2)(i) broker dealer in November 2017 following notification to the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority and the SEC. A company operating under the (k)(2)(i) exemption is not required to lock up customer funds as would otherwise be required under Rule 15c3-3 of the Securities Exchange Act. 44Table of ContentsITEM 7A.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKWe are subject to various market risks, including those caused by changes in interest rates, credit, foreign currency exchange rates and equity prices. Interest Rate Risk Debt outstanding at December 31, 2019 consisted of fixed-rate borrowings of $3.7 billion (in U.S. dollar equivalent). Changes in interest rates impact the fair values of fixed-rate debt, but do not impact earnings or cash flows. We did not have any variable-rate borrowings at December 31, 2019. At December 31, 2019, we maintained $303.8 million of commercial paper. Commercial paper is considered a fixed rate borrowing; however, because maturities for commercial paper are generally less than 90 days, commercial paper is considered subject to interest rate fluctuations.Credit Risk CME Clearing HouseOur clearing house acts as the counterparty to all trades consummated on our exchanges as well as through third party exchanges and swaps markets for which we provide clearing services. As a result, we are exposed to significant credit risk of third parties, including clearing firms. We are also exposed, indirectly, to the credit risk of customers of our clearing firms. These parties may default on their obligations due to bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, operational failure or other reasons. In order to ensure performance, we establish and monitor financial requirements for our clearing firms. We set minimum performance bond requirements for exchange-traded and interest rate swaps products. For clearing firms, we establish performance bond requirements to cover at least 99% of expected price changes for a given product within a given historical period with further quantitative and qualitative considerations based on market risk. We establish haircuts applied to collateral deposited to meet performance bond requirements to cover at least 99% of expected price changes and foreign currency changes for a given asset within a given historical period with further quantitative and qualitative considerations. Haircuts vary depending on the type of collateral and maturity. We mark-to-market open positions of clearing firms at least once a day (twice a day for futures and options contracts) and require payment from clearing firms whose positions have lost value and make payments to clearing firms whose positions have gained value. We have the capability to mark-to-market more frequently as market conditions warrant. These practices allow our clearing house to quickly identify any clearing firms that may not be able to satisfy the financial obligations resulting from changes in the prices of their open positions before those financial obligations become exceptionally large and jeopardize the ability of our clearing house to ensure performance of their open positions. Although we have policies and procedures to help ensure that our clearing firms can satisfy their obligations, these policies and procedures may not succeed in detecting problems or preventing defaults. We also have in place various measures intended to enable us to cover any default and maintain liquidity. Despite our safeguards, we cannot assure you that these measures will be sufficient to protect us from a default or that we will not be materially and adversely affected in the event of a significant default.We maintain two separate financial safeguard packages: •a financial safeguard package for all futures, options and over-the-counter swap contracts other than cleared interest rate swap contracts (base package); and•a financial safeguard package for cleared interest rate swap contracts.In the unlikely event of a payment default by a clearing firm, we would first apply assets of the defaulting clearing firm to satisfy its payment obligation. These assets include the defaulting firm's guaranty fund contributions, performance bonds and any other available assets, such as assets required for clearing membership and any associated trading rights. In addition, we would make a demand for payment pursuant to any applicable guarantee provided to us by the parent company of the clearing firm. Thereafter, if the payment default remains unsatisfied, we would use our corporate contributions designated for the respective financial safeguard package. We would then use guaranty fund contributions of other clearing firms within the respective financial safeguard package and funds collected through an assessment against solvent clearing firms within the respective financial safeguard package to satisfy the deficit.We maintain a $7.0 billion 364-day multi-currency line of credit with a consortium of domestic and international banks to be used in certain situations by our clearing house. We have the option to request an increase in the line from $7.0 billion to $10.0 billion. We may use the proceeds to provide temporary liquidity in the unlikely event of a clearing firm default, in the event of a liquidity constraint or default by a depositary (custodian of the collateral) or in the event of a temporary disruption with the payments systems that would delay payment of settlement variation between us and our clearing firms. The credit agreement requires us to pledge certain assets to the line of credit custodian prior to drawing on the line of credit. Pledged assets may include clearing firm guaranty fund deposits held by us in the form of cash or U.S. Treasury securities. Performance bond collateral of a defaulting clearing firm may also be used to secure a draw on the line. In addition to the 364-day multi-currency 45Table of Contentsline of credit, we also have the option to use our $2.4 billion multi-currency revolving senior credit facility to provide liquidity for our clearing house in the unlikely event of default. At December 31, 2019, aggregate performance bond deposits for clearing firms for both financial safeguard packages was $154.5 billion including cash performance bond deposits, non-cash deposits, Interest Earnings Facility funds and letters of credit. A defaulting firm's performance bond deposits can be used in the event of default of that clearing firm. The following shows the available assets at December 31, 2019 in the event of a payment default by a clearing firm for the base financial safeguard package after first utilizing the defaulting firm's available assets: (in millions) Clearing HouseAvailable AssetsDesignated corporate contributions for futures and options(1) $100.0Guaranty fund contributions(2) 4,902.8Assessment powers(3) 13,482.7_______________(1)Our clearing house designates $100.0 million of corporate contributions to satisfy a clearing firm default in the event that the defaulting clearing firm's guaranty contributions and performance bonds do not satisfy the deficit. (2)Guaranty fund contributions of clearing firms include guaranty fund contributions required of clearing firms, but do not include any excess deposits held by us at the direction of clearing firms. (3)In the event of a clearing firm default, if a loss continues to exist after the utilization of the assets of the defaulted firm, our corporate contribution and the non-defaulting clearing firms' guaranty fund contributions, we would assess all non-defaulting clearing members as provided in the rules governing the guaranty fund. We could assess non-defaulting clearing members 275% of their existing guaranty fund requirements up to a maximum of 550% of their existing guaranty fund requirements as provided in the rules. Assessment powers are calculated to reflect the potential obligation that each clearing member could be called for in the event clearing member defaults exhaust the guaranty fund, however the total amount available would be reduced by the defaulted clearing members assessment obligations since they would no longer be able to satisfy their obligations.The following shows the available assets for the interest rate swap financial safeguard package at December 31, 2019 in the event of a payment default by a clearing firm that clears interest rate swap contracts, after first utilizing the defaulting firm's available assets: (in millions) Clearing HouseAvailable AssetsDesignated corporate contributions for interest rate swap contracts(1) $150.0Guaranty fund contributions(2) 3,559.8Assessment powers(3) 1,609.9_______________(1)Our clearing house designates $150.0 million of corporate contributions to satisfy a clearing firm default in the event that the defaulting clearing firm's guaranty contributions and performance bonds do not satisfy the deficit. (2)Guaranty fund contributions of clearing firms for interest rate swap contracts include guaranty fund contributions required of those clearing firms. (3)In the event of a clearing firm default, if a loss continues to exist after the utilization of the assets of the defaulted firm, our corporate contribution and the non-defaulting firms' guaranty fund contributions, we would assess non-defaulting clearing members as provided in the rules governing the interest rate swap guaranty fund. Assessment powers are calculated to reflected the potential obligation that each clearing member could be called for based on potential failure of the third and fourth largest clearing.BrokerTec Americas Matched Principal BusinessBrokerTec Americas maintains a matched principal business, where it serves as a fully matched counterparty to offsetting positions entered into by clients on its electronic trading platform to facilitate anonymity and access to clearing and settlement. BrokerTec Americas uses Fixed Income Clearing Corporation (FICC), a third-party central clearing house as well as a third-party clearing bank for the settlement of transactions and is required to post short-term margin requirements twice a day that can vary based on the size of unsettled transactions and any adverse market changes. At December 31, 2019, the balance of the collateral at FICC was $100.0 million, which was included in other current assets on the consolidated balance sheet. Without sufficient funds to meet its obligations, BrokerTec Americas could be exposed to risk of breach of contract with the counterparties and the inability to continue as a member of the third-party central clearing house. Transactions with clearing house members are typically confirmed and novated shortly after execution, at which point the clearing house assumes the risk of settlement. For transactions with counterparties that are not members of the third-party clearing house, settlement typically occurs on the day following execution and, prior to settlement, BrokerTec Americas is exposed to the risk of loss in the event a 46Table of Contentscounterparty fails to meet its obligations. If that were to occur, BrokerTec Americas would have the right to cover or liquidate the open position but could incur a loss as a result of market movements.Foreign Currency Exchange Rate RiskForeign Currency Transaction Risk We have foreign currency transaction risk related to changes in exchange rates on monetary assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses held at subsidiaries where those balances and activity are denominated in a currency other than the subsidiary's functional currency. Gains and losses on foreign currency transactions result primarily from cash, debt and other monetary assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses denominated in British pounds, euros and Japanese yen. Aggregate transaction gains (losses) for 2019, 2018 and 2017 were $(7.2) million, $(73.6) million and $9.4 million, respectively. We expect the foreign currency gain/loss to continue to fluctuate as long as we continue to hold monetary assets and liabilities at those subsidiaries. On January 31, 2020, the United Kingdom (U.K.) formally withdrew from the European Union (EU) after a majority of voters in the U.K. approved an exit from the EU, commonly referred to as Brexit. Brexit continues to generate economic and political uncertainty throughout the world, particularly throughout the U.K. and the EU. This uncertainty could potentially lead to significant volatility with foreign currency exchange rates, which could result in additional foreign currency gain/loss. Foreign Currency Translation Risk We have foreign currency translation risk related to the translation of our foreign subsidiaries' assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses from their respective functional currencies to the U.S. dollar at each reporting date. Fluctuations in exchange rates may impact the amount of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses we report on our consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of income. The financial statements of those foreign subsidiaries with functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars using a current exchange rate. Gains and losses resulting from this translation are recognized as a foreign currency translation adjustment within accumulated other comprehensive income, which is a component of shareholders' equity and comprehensive income. Aggregate translation gains (losses), net of tax, for 2019, 2018 and 2017 were $(0.6) million, $(2.5) million and $7.5 million, respectively. Foreign Currency Exchange Risk Related to Customer CollateralA portion of performance bond deposits is denominated in various foreign currencies. We mark-to-market all deposits daily and require payment from clearing firms whose collateral has lost value due to changes in foreign currency rates and price. Therefore, our exposure to foreign currency risk related to performance bond deposits is considered minimal and is not expected to be material to our financial condition or operating results. 47Table of Contents",2023-12-30 20:16:34.363946

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSINTRODUCTIONManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is organized as follows:•Executive Summary: Includes an overview of our business; current economic, competitive and regulatory trends relevant to our business; our current business strategy; and our primary sources of operating and non-operating revenues and expenses.•Critical Accounting Policies: Provides an explanation of accounting policies which may have a significant impact on our financial results and the estimates, assumptions and risks associated with those policies.•Recent Accounting Pronouncements: Includes an evaluation of recent accounting pronouncements and the potential impact of their future adoption on our financial results.•Results of Operations: Includes an analysis of our 2020 financial results and a discussion of any known events or trends which are likely to impact future results.•Liquidity and Capital Resources: Includes a discussion of our future cash requirements, capital resources, significant planned expenditures and financing arrangements.References in this discussion and analysis to “we” and “our” are to CME Group Inc. (CME Group) and its consolidated subsidiaries, collectively. References to “exchange” are to Chicago Mercantile Exchange Inc. (CME), the Board of Trade of the City of Chicago, Inc. (CBOT), New York Mercantile Exchange, Inc. (NYMEX) and Commodity Exchange, Inc. (COMEX), collectively, unless otherwise noted. EXECUTIVE SUMMARYBusiness OverviewCME Group, a Delaware stock corporation, is the holding company for CME, CBOT, NYMEX, COMEX, NEX and their respective subsidiaries. The holding company structure is designed to provide strategic and operational flexibility. CME Group's Class A common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market (Nasdaq) under the ticker symbol ""CME."" Our exchange consists of designated contract markets for the trading of futures and options contracts. We also clear futures, options and swaps contracts through our clearing house. Futures contracts, options contracts and swaps contracts provide investors with vehicles for protecting against, and potentially profiting from, price changes in financial instruments and physical commodities. We are a global company with customer access available virtually all over the world. Our customers consist of professional traders, financial institutions, individual and institutional investors, major corporations, manufacturers, producers, governments and central banks. Customers include both members of the exchange and non-members. We offer our customers the opportunity to trade futures contracts and options contracts on a range of products including those based on interest rates, equity indexes, foreign exchange, agricultural commodities, energy and metals. Through our cash markets business, we offer fixed income trading through BrokerTec and foreign currency trading through EBS. Our products provide a means for hedging, speculating and allocating assets. We identify new products by monitoring economic trends and their impact on the risk management and speculative needs of our existing and prospective customers. Most of our products are available for trading through our electronic trading platforms. These execution facilities offer our customers immediate trade execution and price transparency. In addition, trades can be executed through privately negotiated transactions that are cleared and settled through our clearing house. We also provide optimization services that deliver transaction lifecycle management and information services to help our customers optimize their capital, mitigate their risk and reduce operational costs. Optimization services includes Traiana, TriOptima and Reset.Our clearing house clears, settles and guarantees futures and options contracts traded through our exchanges, in addition to cleared swaps products. Our clearing house's performance guarantee is an important function of our business. Because of this guarantee, our customers do not need to evaluate the credit of each potential counterparty or limit themselves to a selected set of counterparties. This flexibility increases the potential liquidity available for each trade. Additionally, the substitution of our clearing house as the counterparty to every transaction allows our customers to establish a position with one party and offset the position with another party. This contract offsetting process provides our customers with flexibility in establishing and adjusting positions and provides for collateral and margining efficiencies. Certain BrokerTec and EBS contracts are cleared at third-party clearing houses. 31Table of ContentsBusiness TrendsEconomic Environment. Our customers continue to use our markets as an effective and transparent means to manage risk and meet their investment needs. Trading activity in our centralized markets has fluctuated due to the ongoing uncertainty in the financial markets, fluctuations in the availability of credit, variations in the amount of assets under management as well as the Federal Reserve Bank’s interest rate policy and quantitative easing. We continue to maintain high quality and diverse products as well as various clearing and market data services which support our customers in any economic environment. Competitive Environment. Our industry is competitive and we continue to encounter competition in all aspects of our business. We expect competition to continue to intensify, especially in light of ongoing regulatory reform in the financial services industry. Competition is influenced by our brand and reputation; the efficiency and security of our settlement, clearing and support services; depth and liquidity of our markets; diversity of product offerings including frequency and quality of new product development and innovative services; our ability to position and expand upon existing products to address changing market needs; efficient and seamless customer experience; transparency, reliability, anonymity and security of transaction processing; the regulatory environment; connectivity, accessibility, flexibility in execution methods and distribution; technology capability and innovation, as well as overall transaction costs. We believe we are very well positioned with respect to these factors. Our asset classes contain products designed to address differing risk management needs, and customers are able to achieve operational and capital efficiencies by accessing our diverse products through our platforms and our clearing house. We face competition from other futures, securities and securities option exchanges; clearing organizations; swap execution facilities; alternative trade execution facilities; technology firms, including market data distributors and electronic trading system developers; and others. As markets continue to evolve, we will continue to adapt our trading technology and clearing services to meet the needs of our customers. The competitive environment to which we are subject is discussed in ""Item 1. Business"" on page 10.Regulatory Environment. Exchange-traded derivatives have historically been subject to extensive regulation. Developments in the regulatory environment have the potential to significantly impact our business. Compliance with regulations may require us and our customers to dedicate significant financial and operational resources which could adversely affect our profitability. The regulatory environment to which we are subject is discussed in ""Item 1. Business"" on page 11.Business StrategyOur strategy focuses on maximizing futures and options growth globally, diversifying our business and revenues, and delivering unparalleled customer efficiencies and operational excellence. This strategy allows us to continue to develop into a more broadly diversified financial exchange that provides trading and clearing solutions across a wide range of products and asset classes. Our strategic initiatives are discussed in ""Item 1. Business"" on page 7. RevenuesClearing and transaction fees. A majority of our revenue is derived from clearing and transaction fees, which include electronic trading fees, surcharges for privately negotiated transactions and other volume-related charges for exchange-traded and over-the-counter contracts. Because clearing and transaction fees are assessed on a per-contract or notional value basis, revenues and profitability fluctuate with changes in contract volume. In addition to the business trends noted earlier, our contract volume, and consequently our revenues, tend to increase during periods of economic and geopolitical uncertainty as our customers seek to manage their exposure to, or speculate on, the market volatility resulting from that uncertainty. While volume has the most significant impact on our clearing and transaction fees revenue, there are four other factors that also influence this source of revenue: •rate structure;•product mix;•venue; and•the percentage of trades executed by customers who are members compared with non-member customers.Rate structure. Customers benefit from volume discounts and limits on fees as part of our effort to increase liquidity in certain products. We offer various incentive programs to promote trading and clearing in various products and geographic locations. We may periodically change fees, volume discounts, fee limits and member discounts, perhaps significantly, based on our review of operations and the business environment. Product mix. We offer exchange-traded futures and options contracts as well as cleared-only interest rate swap contracts. Through our acquisition of NEX, we also offer foreign exchange spot and forward contracts and fixed income products. 32Table of ContentsRates are varied by product in order to optimize revenue on existing products and to encourage contract volume upon introduction of new products. Venue. Our exchange and platforms are an international marketplace that brings together buyers and sellers mainly through our electronic trading as well as through open outcry trading and privately negotiated transactions. Any customer who is guaranteed by a clearing firm and who agrees to be bound by our exchange rules is able to obtain direct access to our electronic platforms. Open outcry trading is conducted exclusively by our members, who may execute trades on behalf of customers or for themselves. Typically, customers submitting trades through our electronic platforms are charged fees for using the platforms in addition to the fees assessed on all transactions executed on our exchange. Customers entering into privately negotiated transactions also incur additional charges beyond the fees assessed on other transactions. Member/non-member mix. Generally, member customers are charged lower fees than our non-member customers. Holding all other factors constant, revenue decreases if the percentage of trades executed by members increases, and increases if the percentage of non-member trades increases. Clearing and transaction fees for cash markets business. Our cash markets business provides matching services whereby we match a buyer and seller of financial instruments to allow both parties to complete the trade bilaterally or through a third-party clearing house. We are not involved in the settlement of the contract but charge a transaction fee generally based on volume or notional value of the trade for providing the matching service. The cash markets business also includes BrokerTec Americas, which generates revenue from a matched principal business. This business serves as a fully matched counterparty to offsetting positions entered into by clients on its electronic trading platform to facilitate anonymity and access to clearing and settlement. Revenue is generated from this business generally on a transaction fee basis. Other sources. Revenue is also derived from other sources including market data and information services and other various services related to our exchange operations. Market data and information services. We receive market data and information services revenue from the dissemination of our market data to subscribers. Subscribers can obtain access to our market data services either directly or through third-party distributors. Our service offerings include access to real-time, delayed and end-of-day quotations, trade and summary market data for our products and other data sources. Users of our basic service receive real-time quotes and pay a flat monthly fee for each screen, or device, displaying our market data. Alternatively, customers can subscribe to market data provided on a limited group of products. The fee for this service is also a flat rate per month.Pricing for our market data services is based on the value of the service provided and the price of comparable services offered by our competitors. Increases or decreases in our market data and information services revenue are influenced by changes in our price structure and incentive programs for existing market data offerings, introduction of new market data services and changes in the number of devices in use. General economic factors that affect the financial services industry, which constitutes our primary customer base, also influence revenue from our market data services. Other revenues. Other revenue includes access and communication fees. Access and communication fees are connectivity fees charged to members and clearing firms that utilize our various telecommunications networks and communications services. Our communication services include our co-location program as well as the connectivity charges to customers of the CME Globex platform. Access fee revenue varies depending on the type of connection provided to customers. Other revenues include revenues from our optimization services, which include fees for risk management and information services for the over-the-counter markets, including portfolio reconciliation and post-trade processing. Revenue earned from these services is typically generated through subscriptions or transaction fees. Other revenues also include fees for post-trade services, fees for collateral management, equity subscription fees and fees for trade order routing through agreements from various strategic relationships as well as other services to members and clearing firms.ExpensesThe majority of our expenses do not vary directly with changes in our contract volume. However, licensing and other fee agreements can vary directly with certain equity, energy and swap volumes as well as the majority of our employee bonuses vary directly with overall contract volume. Compensation and benefits. Compensation and benefits expense is our most significant expense and includes employee wages, bonuses, stock-based compensation, benefits and employer taxes. Changes in this expense are driven by fluctuations in the number of employees, increases in wages as a result of inflation or labor market conditions, changes in rates for employer taxes and other cost increases affecting benefit plans. In addition, this expense is affected by the composition of our workforce. 33Table of ContentsThe expense associated with our bonus and stock-based compensation plans can also have a significant impact on this expense category. The bonus component of our compensation and benefits expense is based on our financial performance. Under the performance criteria of our annual incentive plans, the bonus funded under the plans is based on achieving certain financial performance targets established by the compensation committee of our board of directors. The compensation committee has discretion to make equitable adjustments to the cash earnings performance calculation to reflect effects of unplanned operating results or capital expenditures to meet intermediate- to long-term growth opportunities. In general, stock-based compensation is a non-cash expense related to restricted stock and performance share grants. Stock-based compensation varies depending on the quantity and fair value of awards granted. The fair value of restricted stock awards and other performance share grants is based on either the share price on the date of the grant or a model of expected future stock prices. Professional fees and outside services. This expense includes fees for consulting services received on strategic and technology initiatives; regulatory and other compliance matters; temporary labor as well as legal and accounting fees. This expense may fluctuate as a result of changes in services required to complete initiatives, handle legal proceedings and comply with regulatory and compliance requirements.Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense results from the depreciation of long-lived assets such as buildings, leasehold improvements, furniture, fixtures and equipment. This expense also includes the amortization of purchased and internally developed software. Amortization of purchased intangibles. Amortization of purchased intangibles includes amortization of intangible assets obtained in our acquisitions of CBOT Holdings, Inc., NYMEX Holdings, Inc. and NEX as well as other asset and business acquisitions. Intangible assets subject to amortization consist primarily of clearing firm, market data and other customer relationships. Other expenses. We incur additional ongoing expenses for communications, technology support services and various other activities necessary to support our operations. •Technology expense consists of costs related to maintenance of the hardware and software required to support our technology. It also includes costs for network connections for our electronic platforms and some market data customers; telecommunications costs of our exchange, and fees paid for access to external market data. This expense may be driven by system capacity, functionality and redundancy requirements. It also may be impacted by growth in electronic contract volume and changes in the number of telecommunications hubs and connections which allow customers outside the U.S. to access our electronic platforms directly. •Licensing and other fee agreements expense includes license fees paid as a result of contract volume in equity index products. This expense also includes royalty fees and broker rebates on energy and metals products as well as revenue sharing on cleared swaps contracts and some new product launches. This expense fluctuates with changes in contract volumes as well as changes in fee structures. •Other expenses include occupancy and building operations expenses including rent, maintenance, real estate taxes, utilities and other related costs related to leased property in Chicago, New York, the U.K., India as well as other smaller locations throughout the world. Other expenses also include marketing and travel-related expenses as well as general and administrative costs. Marketing, advertising and public relations expense includes media, print and other advertising costs, as well as costs associated with our product promotion. Other expenses also include litigation and customer settlements, impairment charges on operating assets, gains and losses on disposals of certain operating assets, and foreign currency transaction gains and losses resulting from changes in exchange rates on certain foreign monetary assets and liabilities.Non-Operating Income and ExpensesIncome and expenses incurred through activities outside of our core operations are considered non-operating. These activities include non-core investing and financing activities. •Investment income includes income from short-term investment of clearing firms' cash performance bonds and guaranty fund contributions as well as excess operating cash; interest income and realized gains and losses from our marketable securities; realized gains and losses as well as dividend income from our strategic equity investments, and gains and losses on trading securities in our non-qualified deferred compensation plans. Investment income is influenced by market interest rates, changes in the levels of cash performance bonds deposited by clearing firms, the amount of dividends distributed by our strategic investments and the availability of funds generated by operations. 34Table of Contents•Interest and other borrowing costs expense includes charges associated with various short-term and long-term funding facilities, including commitment fees on lines of credit agreements.•Equity in net earnings (losses) of unconsolidated subsidiaries includes income and losses from our investments in S&P/Dow Jones Indices LLC (S&P/DJI), Shanghai CFETS-NEX International Money Broking Co., Ltd. and Dubai Mercantile Exchange.•Other income (expense) includes expenses related to the distribution of a portion of interest earned on performance bond collateral reinvestment to the clearing firms, gains and losses on derivative contracts as well as other various income and expenses outside our core operations.CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIESThe notes to our consolidated financial statements include disclosure of our significant accounting policies. In establishing these policies within the framework of accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., management must make certain assessments, estimates and choices that will result in the application of these principles in a manner that appropriately reflects our financial condition and results of operations. Critical accounting policies are those policies that we believe present the most complex or subjective measurements and have the most potential to affect our financial position and operating results. While all decisions regarding accounting policies are important, there are certain accounting policies that we consider to be critical. These critical policies, which are presented in detail in the notes to our consolidated financial statements, relate to the valuation of financial instruments, goodwill and intangible assets, revenue recognition, income taxes and internal use software costs. Valuation of financial instruments. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, or an exit price. We have categorized financial instruments measured at fair value into the following three-level fair value hierarchy based upon the level of judgment associated with the inputs used to measure the fair value: •Level 1 inputs, which are considered the most reliable evidence of fair value, consist of quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets. •Level 2 inputs consist of observable market data, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, or inputs other than quoted prices that are directly observable. •Level 3 inputs consist of unobservable inputs, which are derived and cannot be corroborated by market data or other entity-specific inputs.For further discussion regarding the fair value of financial assets and liabilities, see note 2 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Goodwill and intangible assets. We review goodwill for impairment on a quarterly basis and whenever events or circumstances indicate that its carrying value may not be recoverable. Goodwill may be tested quantitatively for impairment by comparing the carrying value of a reporting unit to its estimated fair value. Estimating the fair value of a reporting unit involves the use of valuation techniques that rely on significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions may include forecasted revenue growth rates; forecasted operating margins; risk-adjusted discount rates; forecasted economic and market conditions, and industry multiples. We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable given the information that is available to us at the time of our assessment; however, actual future results may differ significantly from those estimates. Under certain favorable circumstances, goodwill may be reviewed qualitatively for indications of impairment without utilizing valuation techniques to estimate fair value. The qualitative assessment of goodwill may rely on significant assumptions about forecasts of revenue growth, operating margins and economic conditions as well as overall market and industry-specific trends. In addition, the carrying value of goodwill, as denominated in foreign currencies, is adjusted each reporting period as a result of movements in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar. Such foreign currency translation adjustments are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within shareholders' equity.We also review indefinite-lived intangible assets on a quarterly basis or more frequently when events and circumstances indicate that their carrying values may not be recoverable. Indefinite-lived intangible assets may be tested quantitatively for impairment by comparing their carrying values to their estimated fair values. Estimating the fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets involves the use of valuation techniques that rely on significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions may include forecasted revenue growth rates, forecasted allocations of expense and risk-adjusted discount rates. We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable given the information that is available to us at the time of our assessment; however, actual future results may differ significantly from those estimates. Similar to goodwill, under certain favorable circumstances, indefinite-lived intangible assets may be reviewed qualitatively for indications of impairment without utilizing valuation techniques to estimate fair value. The qualitative assessment of indefinite-lived intangible assets may rely on significant assumptions about forecasts of revenue growth, operating margins and economic conditions as well as overall market and industry-specific trends.35Table of ContentsIntangible assets subject to amortization are also assessed for impairment on a quarterly basis or more frequently when indicated by a change in economic or operational circumstances. The impairment assessment of these assets requires management to first compare the carrying value of the amortizing asset to its undiscounted net cash flows. If the carrying value exceeds the undiscounted net cash flows, management is then required to estimate the fair value of the assets and record an impairment loss for the excess of the carrying value over the fair value. In connection with this impairment assessment, management also challenges the useful lives of our definite-lived intangible assets on a periodic basis. Revenue recognition. A significant portion of our revenue is derived from the clearing and transaction fees we assess on each contract executed through our trading venues and cleared through our clearing house. Clearing and transaction fees are recognized as revenue when a buy and sell order are matched and when the trade is cleared. On occasion, the customer's exchange trading privileges may not be properly entered by the clearing firm and incorrect fees are charged for the transactions in the affected accounts. When this information is corrected within the time period allowed by the exchange, a fee adjustment is provided to the clearing firm. A reserve is established for estimated fee adjustments to reflect corrections to customer exchange trading privileges. This reserve has historically been immaterial. The reserve is based on the historical pattern of adjustments processed as well as management's estimate of future adjustment activity.Income taxes. Calculation of the income tax provision includes an estimate of the income taxes that will be paid for the current year as well as an estimate of income tax liabilities or benefits deferred into future years. Deferred tax assets are reviewed to determine if they will be realized in future periods. To the extent it is determined that some deferred tax assets may not be fully realized, the assets are reduced to their realizable value by a valuation allowance. The calculation of our tax provision involves uncertainty in the application of complex tax regulations and we occasionally may consult with relevant tax authorities or engage third party expertise where appropriate. We recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the United States and other applicable foreign tax jurisdictions using a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold based on the technical merits of the tax position taken or expected to be taken. If the actual obligation of these amounts varies from our estimate, our income tax provision would be reduced or increased at the time that determination is made. This determination may not be known for several years. Past tax audits have not resulted in tax adjustments that resulted in a material change to the income tax provision in the year the audit was completed. The effective tax rate, defined as the income tax provision as a percentage of income before income taxes, will vary from year to year based on changes in tax jurisdictions, tax rates and regulations. In addition, the effective tax rate will vary with changes to income that are not subject to income tax and changes in expenses or losses that are not deductible, such as the utilization of foreign net operating losses. Internal use software costs. Certain internal and external costs that are incurred in connection with developing or obtaining software for internal use are capitalized. We also enter into software hosting arrangements for software projects maintained in the cloud. Software development costs incurred during the planning or maintenance stages of a software project are expensed as incurred, while costs incurred during the application development stage are capitalized and are amortized over the estimated useful life of the software, which is generally two to four years, but up to eight years for certain trading and clearing applications, depending upon expected useful lives. Amortization of capitalized costs begins only when the software becomes ready for its intended use. In addition, software assets are assessed for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying values may not be recoverable or that a reduction in the estimated useful lives is warranted.RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTSRefer to note 2 in our notes to the consolidated financial statements for information on newly adopted accounting pronouncements that are applicable to us.36Table of ContentsRESULTS OF OPERATIONSFinancial HighlightsThe following summarizes significant changes in our financial performance for the years presented.

Total contract volume includes contracts that are traded on our exchange and cleared through our clearing house and certain cleared-only contracts. Volume is measured in round turns, which is considered a completed transaction that involves a purchase and an offsetting sale of a contract. Average rate per contract is determined by dividing total clearing and transaction fees by total contract volume. Contract volume and average rate per contract disclosures below exclude trading volume for the cash markets business as well as interest rate swaps.

Due to the relationship between average rate per contract and contract volume, the change in clearing and transaction fees attributable to changes in each is only an approximation.Contract VolumeThe following table summarizes average daily contract volume. Contract volume can be influenced by many factors, including political and economic factors, the regulatory environment and market competition.

During the first quarter of 2020, the Federal Reserve made the unexpected decision to lower the federal funds rate due to economic concerns from the COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in significant volatility within the financial and equity markets. However, interest rate volatility subsided following indication by the Federal Reserve that it did not intend to raise interest rates in the foreseeable future. Equity market volatility remained high throughout 2020 as a result of the governmental and business response to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as political uncertainty surrounding the U.S. Presidential and Congressional elections in November. In addition, heightened producer price competition within the oil markets combined with lower energy demands during the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in significant market volatility within the energy market during the first quarter of 2020. However, this volatility subsided as oil prices stabilized and demand for crude oil remained low for the remainder of 2020. We believe these factors led to the changes in volume in 2020 when compared with 2019. 38Table of ContentsInterest Rate ProductsThe following table summarizes average daily contract volume for our key interest rate products. Eurodollar front 8 contracts include contracts expiring within two years. Eurodollar back 32 contracts include contracts expiring within three to ten years.

We believe this was due to the Federal Reserve's decision to cut interest rates to near zero in early 2020 and its indication that it would not raise interest rates in the foreseeable future in response to the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Equity Index ProductsThe following table summarizes average daily contract volume for our key equity index products. Volume below for the year ended 2019 includes Micro-E-mini contract volumes for each index beginning on May 6, 2019, which was the date the contracts were launched.

We believe the increase in volatility was attributable to uncertainty surrounding the economic impact of governmental and business actions to combat the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as political uncertainty surrounding the U.S. presidential and congressional elections. Average daily contract volume in 2020 also included Micro-E-mini equity index contract volume of approximately 1.8 million per day compared to approximately 0.3 million per day in 2019. Micro-E-mini equity index contracts have a notional size of one-tenth of the traditional E-mini contracts. Foreign Exchange ProductsThe following table summarizes average daily contract volume for our key foreign exchange products.

In 2020, market volatility subsided in the second half of the year following very high foreign exchange volatility in the first quarter caused by significant uncertainty surrounding the economic impacts of governmental and business 39Table of Contentsactions to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, we believe foreign exchange trading declined slightly due to operational strains from stay at home orders and risk aversion by market participants during the COVID-19 pandemic. Agricultural Commodity ProductsThe following table summarizes average daily volume for our key agricultural commodity products. Year-over-Year Change(amounts in thousands)202020192020-2019Corn444525(15)%Soybean30726316 Wheat 2202152 Overall commodity contract volume was relatively flat in 2020 when compared with 2019. Corn contract volume decreased due to lower price volatility, which we believe was caused by large stock piles and lower demand. We believe the increase in soybean contract volume was due to an increase in demand for commodities from China.Energy ProductsThe following table summarizes average daily volume for our key energy products.

The increase in natural gas volume is the result of significant price declines in early 2020 followed by price increases in the second half of 2020 as a result of higher demand during the winter months. This was partially offset by a decrease in crude oil volume due to a reduction in demand caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.Metal ProductsThe following table summarizes average daily volume for our key metal products.Year-over-Year Change(amounts in thousands)202020192020-2019Gold4564335 %Silver12310715 Copper9898— Overall metal contract volume increased in 2020 when compared with 2019 due to an increase in metals price volatility caused by investors using gold and other precious metals as safe-haven alternative investments due to significant uncertainty within other markets caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.Average Rate per ContractThe average rate per contract was substantially the same in 2020 when compared with 2019. There was an increase in the average rate per contract due to a change in product mix. Interest rate contract volume decreased by 12 percentage points as a percent of total volume, while all other products collectively increased by 12 percentage points. In general, interest rate products have a lower rate per contract compared with the remaining contracts. The increase in the average rate per contract was offset by the introduction of the micro-E-mini equity index contracts in mid-2019, which have a lower average rate per contract compared with a standard E-mini contract. Micro-E-mini equity index contracts have a notional size of one-tenth of the traditional E-mini contracts.40Table of ContentsCash Markets BusinessTotal clearing and transaction fees revenue in 2020 includes $447.4 million of transaction fees attributable to the cash markets business acquired from NEX compared with $483.0 million in 2019.

Concentration of RevenueWe bill a significant portion of our clearing and transaction fees to our clearing firms. The majority of clearing and transaction fees received from clearing firms represent charges for trades executed and cleared on behalf of their customers. One clearing firm represented approximately 10% of our clearing and transaction fees in 2020. Should a clearing firm withdraw, we believe that the customer portion of the firm's trading activity would likely transfer to another clearing firm of the exchange. Therefore, we do not believe we are exposed to significant risk from an ongoing loss of revenue received from or through a particular clearing firm. Other Sources of RevenueMarket data and information services. In 2020 when compared with 2019, the increase in market data and information services revenue was largely attributable to an increase in certain device fees, an increase in subscriber device counts and higher demand for CME Group data.The two largest resellers of our market data represented, in aggregate, approximately 35% of our market data and information services revenue in 2020. Despite this concentration, we consider exposure to significant risk of revenue loss to be minimal. In the event that one of these vendors no longer subscribes to our market data, we believe the majority of that vendor's customers would likely subscribe to our market data through another reseller. Additionally, several of our largest institutional customers that utilize services from our two largest resellers report usage and remit payment of their fees directly to us.Other revenues. The increase in other revenues in 2020 when compared with 2019 is largely attributable to an increase in custody fees due to a new rate structure put in place in 2020.41Table of ContentsExpenses Year-over-Year Change(dollars in millions)202020192020-2019Compensation and benefits$856.5 $898.7 (5)%Technology198.5 201.5 (2)Professional fees and outside services191.3 174.1 10 Amortization of purchased intangibles311.2 314.7 (1)Depreciation and amortization153.2 158.6 (3)Licensing and other fee agreements244.9 172.2 42 Other290.6 360.4 (19)Total Expenses$2,246.2 $2,280.2 (1)2020 Compared With 2019Operating expenses decreased by $34.0 million in 2020 when compared with 2019.

The decrease in investment income in 2020 when compared with 2019 was largely due to a decline in earnings from cash performance bond and guaranty fund contributions that are reinvested. The decrease in earnings resulted primarily from lower rates of interest earned in the cash account at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago following significant interest rate cuts in early 2020 despite an increase in our average reinvestment amount. Interest and other borrowing costs. Interest and other borrowing costs were lower in 2020 when compared with 2019, primarily due to lower borrowing costs on commercial paper issuances, as there were higher average balances of commercial paper outstanding during 2019 when compared with 2020. Interest and other borrowing costs were also lower during 2020 due to interest expense recognized on the €350.0 million fixed rate notes and the ¥19.1 billion term loan assumed as part of the NEX acquisition in 2018 and subsequently paid off during the first quarter of 2019.Equity in net earnings (losses) of unconsolidated subsidiaries. Higher income generated from our S&P/DJI business venture contributed to an increase in equity in net earnings (losses) of unconsolidated subsidiaries in 2020 when compared with 2019.Other income (expense). In 2020 when compared with 2019, we recognized lower expense related to a reduction in the distribution of interest earned on performance bond collateral reinvestments to the clearing firms due to lower interest income earned on our reinvestment. In addition, a gain of $1.5 million was recognized on derivative contracts in 2020 compared with a net loss of $17.7 million in 2019.Income Tax ProvisionThe following table summarizes the effective tax rate for the periods presented: 20202019Year-over-Year Change2020-2019Year ended December 3122.6 %21.3 %1.3 %In 2020 when compared with 2019, the effective tax rate was higher due to the recognition of additional benefits from the Internal Revenue Code Section 250 deduction in 2019. Proposed FDII Deduction regulations were released in 2019 and as a result, we revised our income tax calculations to reflect the proposed guidance. The benefit recognized in 2019 includes estimates for the deduction for 2018 and 2019, whereas the benefit recognized in 2020 only includes the deduction for 2020.LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESCash RequirementsWe have historically met our funding requirements with cash generated by our ongoing operations. However, as part of the funding for the NEX acquisition, we utilized our commercial paper program in late 2018 and through the beginning of the second quarter of 2020 for short-term funding requirements. While our cost structure is generally fixed in the short term, our sources of operating cash are largely dependent on contract trading volume levels. In addition to using our existing cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and cash generated from operations, we may continue to utilize our commercial paper program to meet our working capital needs, capital expenditures and other commitments. It is also possible that we may need to raise additional funds to finance our activities through future public debt offerings or by direct borrowings from financial institutions through our committed revolving credit facilities.Future capital expenditures for technology are anticipated as we continue to support our growth through increased system capacity, performance improvements, integration of acquired platforms as well as improvements to some of our office spaces. Each year, capital expenditures are incurred for improvements to and modification of our offices, remote data centers, telecommunications network and other operating equipment. In 2021, we expect capital expenditures to total approximately $180.0 million to $190.0 million, net of any leasehold improvement allowances and any one-time costs associated with the NEX integration. We continue to monitor our capital needs and may revise our forecasted expenditures as necessary in the future. 43Table of ContentsWe intend to continue to pay a regular quarterly dividend to our shareholders, with a target of between 50% to 60% of the prior year's cash earnings. The decision to pay a dividend and the amount of the dividend, however, remains within the discretion of our board of directors and may be affected by various factors, including our earnings, financial condition, capital requirements, levels of indebtedness and other considerations our board of directors deems relevant. We are also required to comply with restrictions contained in the general corporation laws of our state of incorporation, which could also limit our ability to declare and pay dividends. On February 3, 2021 the board of directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.90 per share. The dividend will be payable on March 25, 2021 to shareholders of record on March 10, 2021. Assuming no changes in the number of shares outstanding, the first quarter dividend payment will total approximately $322.0 million. The board of directors also declared an additional, annual variable dividend of $2.50 per share on December 10, 2020 paid on January 13, 2021 to the shareholders of record on December 28, 2020. In general, the amount of the annual variable dividend will be determined by the end of each year, and the level will increase or decrease from year to year based on operating results, capital expenditures, potential merger and acquisition activity and other forms of capital return including regular dividends and share buybacks during the prior year. Sources and Uses of CashThe following is a summary of cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities.

The increase in cash used in financing activities was partially offset by a reduction in the amount of outstanding debt repayments in 2020 compared with 2019. Debt InstrumentsThe following table summarizes our debt outstanding as of December 31, 2020:(in millions)Par ValueFixed rate notes due September 2022, stated rate of 3.00% (1)$750.0 Fixed rate notes due May 2023, stated rate of 4.30%€15.0 Fixed rate notes due March 2025, stated rate of 3.00% (2)$750.0 Fixed rate notes due June 2028, stated rate of 3.75%$500.0 Fixed rate notes due September 2043, stated rate of 5.30% (3)$750.0 Fixed rate notes due June 2048, stated rate of 4.15%$700.0 _______________(1)We maintained a forward-starting interest rate swap agreement that modified the interest obligation associated with these notes so that the interest payable on the notes effectively became fixed at a rate of 3.32%.(2)We maintained a forward-starting interest rate swap agreement that modified the interest obligation associated with these notes so that the interest payable on the notes effectively became fixed at a rate of 3.11%.(3)We maintained a forward-starting interest rate swap agreement that modified the interest obligation associated with these notes so that the interest payable effectively became fixed at a rate of 4.73%.We maintain a $2.4 billion multi-currency revolving senior credit facility with various financial institutions, which matures in November 2022. The proceeds from this facility can be used for general corporate purposes, which includes providing liquidity for our clearing house in certain circumstances at our discretion and, if necessary, for maturities of commercial paper. As long 44Table of Contentsas we are not in default under this facility, we have the option to increase it up to $3.0 billion with the consent of the agent and lenders providing the additional funds. This facility is voluntarily pre-payable from time to time without premium or penalty. Under this facility, we are required to remain in compliance with a consolidated net worth test, which is defined as our consolidated shareholders' equity at September 30, 2017, giving effect to share repurchases made and special dividends paid during the term of the agreements (and in no event greater than $2.0 billion in aggregate), multiplied by 0.65. We currently do not have any borrowings outstanding under this facility, but the outstanding commercial paper balance is backstopped against this facility. We maintain a 364-day multi-currency revolving secured credit facility with a consortium of domestic and international banks to be used in certain situations by CME Clearing. The facility provides for borrowings of up to $7.0 billion. We may use the proceeds to provide temporary liquidity in the unlikely event a clearing firm fails to promptly discharge an obligation to CME Clearing, in the event of a liquidity constraint or default by a depository (custodian for our collateral), in the event of a temporary disruption with the domestic payments system that would delay payment of settlement variation between us and our clearing firms, or in other cases as provided by the CME rulebook. Clearing firm guaranty fund contributions received in the form of cash or U.S. Treasury securities as well as the performance bond assets (pursuant to the CME rulebook) can be used to collateralize the facility. At December 31, 2020, guaranty fund contributions available to collateralize the facility totaled $8.0 billion. We have the option to request an increase in the line from $7.0 billion to $10.0 billion. Our 364-day facility contains a requirement that CME remains in compliance with a consolidated tangible net worth test, defined as CME consolidated shareholder's equity less intangible assets (as defined in the agreement), of not less than $800.0 million. We currently do not have any borrowings outstanding under this facility. The indentures governing our fixed rate notes, our $2.4 billion multi-currency revolving senior credit facility and our 364-day multi-currency revolving secured credit facility for $7.0 billion do not contain specific covenants that restrict the ability to pay dividends. These documents, however, do contain other customary financial and operating covenants that place restrictions on the operations of the company that could indirectly affect the ability to pay dividends. At December 31, 2020, we have excess borrowing capacity for general corporate purposes of approximately $2.4 billion under our multi-currency revolving senior credit facility. At December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with the various covenant requirements of all our debt facilities. CME Group, as a holding company, has no operations of its own. Instead, it relies on dividends declared and paid to it by its subsidiaries in order to provide a portion of the funds which it uses to pay dividends to its shareholders. To satisfy our performance bond obligation with Singapore Exchange Limited, we may pledge CME-owned U.S. Treasury securities or U.S. dollars in lieu of, or in combination with, irrevocable letters of credit. At December 31, 2020, we had pledged letters of credit totaling $310.0 million. The following table summarizes our credit ratings as of December 31, 2020: Rating AgencyShort-TermDebt RatingLong-TermDebt RatingOutlookStandard & Poor’sA1+AA-StableMoody’s Investors ServiceP1Aa3StableGiven our cash flow generation, our ability to pay down debt levels and our ability to refinance existing debt facilities, if necessary, we expect to maintain an investment grade rating. If our ratings are downgraded below investment grade due to a change of control, we are required to make an offer to repurchase our fixed rate notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest.Liquidity and Cash ManagementCash and cash equivalents totaled $1.6 billion at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019. The balance retained in cash and cash equivalents is a function of anticipated or possible short-term cash needs, prevailing interest rates, our corporate investment policy and alternative investment choices. A majority of our cash and cash equivalents balance is invested in money market mutual funds that invest only in U.S. Treasury securities, U.S. government agency securities and U.S. Treasury security reverse repurchase agreements, and short-term bank deposits. Our exposure to credit and liquidity risk is minimal given the nature of the investments. Cash that is not available for general corporate purposes because of regulatory requirements or other restrictions is classified as restricted cash and is included in other current assets or other assets on the consolidated balance sheets.Our practice is to have our pension plan 100% funded at each year end on a projected benefit obligation basis, while also satisfying any minimum required contribution and obtaining the maximum tax deduction. Based on our actuarial projections, we estimate that an additional contribution may be necessary in 2021 to meet our funding goal. However, the amount of the 45Table of Contentsactual contribution is contingent on various factors, including the actual rate of return on our plan assets during 2021 and the December 31, 2021 discount rate. Regulatory Requirements CME is regulated by the CFTC as a U.S. Derivatives Clearing Organization (DCO). DCOs are required to maintain capital, as defined by the CFTC, in an amount at least equal to one year of projected operating expenses as well as cash, liquid securities, or a line of credit at least equal to six months of projected operating expenses. CME was designated by the Financial Stability Oversight Council as a systemically important financial market utility under Title VIII of Dodd-Frank. As a result, CME must comply with CFTC regulations applicable to a systemically important DCO for financial resources and liquidity resources. CME is in compliance with all DCO financial requirements.CME, CBOT, NYMEX and COMEX are regulated by the CFTC as Designated Contract Markets (DCM). DCMs are required to maintain capital, as defined by the CFTC, in an amount at least equal to one year of projected operating expenses as well as cash, liquid securities or a line of credit at least equal to six months of projected operating expenses. Our DCMs are in compliance with all DCM financial requirements. BrokerTec Americas LLC is required to maintain sufficient net capital under Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act), Rule 15c3-1 (the Net Capital Rule). The Net Capital Rule focuses on liquidity and is designed to protect securities customers, counterparties, and creditors by requiring that broker-dealers have sufficient liquid resources on hand at all times to satisfy claims promptly. Rule 15c3-3, or the customer protection rule, which complements Rule 15c3-1, is designed to ensure that customer property (securities and funds) in the custody of broker-dealers is adequately safeguarded. By law, both of these rules apply to the activities of registered broker-dealers, but not to unregistered affiliates. The firm began operating as a (k)(2)(i) broker-dealer in November 2017 following notification to FINRA and the SEC. A company operating under the (k)(2)(i) exemption is not required to lock up customer funds as would otherwise be required under Rule 15c3-3 of the Exchange Act.ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKWe are subject to various market risks, including those caused by changes in interest rates, credit and foreign currency exchange rates.Interest Rate Risk Debt outstanding at December 31, 2020 consisted of fixed-rate borrowings of $3.4 billion (in U.S. dollar equivalent). Changes in interest rates impact the fair values of fixed-rate debt, but do not impact earnings or cash flows. We did not have any variable-rate borrowings at December 31, 2020. Credit Risk CME Clearing HouseOur clearing house acts as the counterparty to all trades consummated on our exchanges as well as through third-party exchanges and swaps markets for which we provide clearing services. As a result, we are exposed to significant credit risk of third parties, including clearing firms. We are also exposed, indirectly, to the credit risk of customers of our clearing firms. These parties may default on their obligations due to bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, operational failure or other reasons. In order to ensure performance, we establish and monitor financial requirements for our clearing firms. We set minimum performance bond requirements for exchange-traded and interest rate swaps products. For clearing firms, we establish performance bond requirements to cover at least 99% of expected price changes for a given product within a given historical period with further quantitative and qualitative considerations based on market risk. We establish haircuts applied to collateral deposited to meet performance bond requirements to cover at least 99% of expected price changes and foreign currency changes for a given asset within a given historical period with further quantitative and qualitative considerations. Haircuts vary depending on the type of collateral and maturity. We mark-to-market open positions of clearing firms at least once a day (twice a day for futures and options contracts) and require payment from clearing firms whose positions have lost value and make payments to clearing firms whose positions have gained value. We have the capability to mark-to-market more frequently as market conditions warrant. These practices allow our clearing house to quickly identify any clearing firms that may not be able to satisfy the financial obligations resulting from changes in the prices of their open positions before those financial obligations become exceptionally large and jeopardize the ability of our clearing house to ensure performance of their open positions. Although we have policies and procedures to help ensure that our clearing firms can satisfy their obligations, these policies and procedures may not succeed in detecting problems or preventing defaults. We also have in place various measures intended to enable us to cover any default and maintain liquidity. Despite our safeguards, we cannot guarantee that these measures will be sufficient to protect us from a default or that we will not be materially and adversely affected in the event of a significant default.46Table of ContentsWe maintain two separate financial safeguard packages: •a financial safeguard package for all futures, options and over-the-counter swap contracts other than cleared interest rate swap contracts (base package); and•a financial safeguard package for cleared interest rate swap contracts.In the unlikely event of a payment default by a clearing firm, we would first apply assets of the defaulting clearing firm to satisfy its payment obligation. These assets include the defaulting firm's guaranty fund contributions, performance bonds and any other available assets, such as assets required for clearing membership and any associated trading rights. In addition, we would make a demand for payment pursuant to any applicable guarantee provided to us by the parent company of the clearing firm. Thereafter, if the payment default remains unsatisfied, we would use our corporate contributions designated for the respective financial safeguard package. We would then use guaranty fund contributions of other clearing firms within the respective financial safeguard package and funds collected through an assessment against solvent clearing firms within the respective financial safeguard package to satisfy the deficit.We maintain a $7.0 billion 364-day multi-currency line of credit with a consortium of domestic and international banks to be used in certain situations by our clearing house. We have the option to request an increase in the line from $7.0 billion to $10.0 billion. We may use the proceeds to provide temporary liquidity in the unlikely event of a clearing firm default, in the event of a liquidity constraint or default by a depositary (custodian of the collateral) or in the event of a temporary disruption with the payments systems that would delay payment of settlement variation between us and our clearing firms. The credit agreement requires us to pledge certain assets to the line of credit custodian prior to drawing on the line of credit. Pledged assets may include clearing firm guaranty fund deposits held by us in the form of cash or U.S. Treasury securities. Performance bond collateral of a defaulting clearing firm may also be used to secure a draw on the line. In addition to the 364-day multi-currency line of credit, we also have the option to use our $2.4 billion multi-currency revolving senior credit facility to provide liquidity for our clearing house in the unlikely event of default. At December 31, 2020, aggregate performance bond deposits for clearing firms for both financial safeguard packages was $211.9 billion including cash performance bond deposits, non-cash deposits, Interest Earnings Facility funds and letters of credit. A defaulting firm's performance bond deposits can be used in the event of default of that clearing firm. The following shows the available assets at December 31, 2020 in the event of a payment default by a clearing firm for the base financial safeguard package after first utilizing the defaulting firm's available assets: (in millions)Clearing HouseAvailable AssetsDesignated corporate contributions for futures and options(1)$100.0 Guaranty fund contributions(2)4,654.1 Assessment powers(3)12,798.9 _______________(1)Our clearing house designates $100.0 million of corporate contributions to satisfy a clearing firm default in the event that the defaulting clearing firm's guaranty contributions and performance bonds do not satisfy the deficit. (2)Guaranty fund contributions of clearing firms include guaranty fund contributions required of clearing firms, but do not include any excess deposits held by us at the direction of clearing firms. (3)In the event of a clearing firm default, if a loss continues to exist after the utilization of the assets of the defaulted firm, our corporate contribution and the non-defaulting clearing firms' guaranty fund contributions, we would assess all non-defaulting clearing members as provided in the rules governing the guaranty fund. We could assess non-defaulting clearing members 275% of their existing guaranty fund requirements up to a maximum of 550% of their existing guaranty fund requirements as provided in the rules. Assessment powers are calculated to reflect the potential obligation that each clearing member could be called for in the event clearing member defaults exhaust the guaranty fund; however, the total amount available would be reduced by the defaulted clearing members' assessment obligations since they would no longer be able to satisfy their obligations.47Table of ContentsThe following shows the available assets for the interest rate swap financial safeguard package at December 31, 2020 in the event of a payment default by a clearing firm that clears interest rate swap contracts, after first utilizing the defaulting firm's available assets: (in millions)Clearing HouseAvailable AssetsDesignated corporate contributions for interest rate swap contracts(1)$150.0 Guaranty fund contributions(2)3,392.1 Assessment powers(3)1,089.5 _______________(1)Our clearing house designates $150.0 million of corporate contributions to satisfy a clearing firm default in the event that the defaulting clearing firm's guaranty contributions and performance bonds do not satisfy the deficit.

(3)In the event of a clearing firm default, if a loss continues to exist after the utilization of the assets of the defaulted firm, our corporate contribution and the non-defaulting firms' guaranty fund contributions, we would assess non-defaulting clearing members as provided in the rules governing the interest rate swap guaranty fund. Assessment powers are calculated to reflected the potential obligation that each clearing member could be called for based on potential failure of the third and fourth largest clearing.BrokerTec Americas Matched Principal BusinessBrokerTec Americas maintains a matched principal business, where it serves as a fully matched counterparty to offsetting positions entered into by clients on its electronic trading platform to facilitate anonymity and access to clearing and settlement. BrokerTec Americas uses Fixed Income Clearing Corporation (FICC), a third-party central clearing house as well as a third-party clearing bank for the settlement of transactions and is required to post short-term margin requirements twice a day that can vary based on the size of unsettled transactions and any adverse market changes. At December 31, 2020, the balance of the collateral at FICC was $100.1 million, which was included in other current assets on the consolidated balance sheet. Without sufficient funds to meet its obligations, BrokerTec Americas could be exposed to risk of breach of contract with the counterparties and the inability to continue as a member of the third-party central clearing house. Transactions with clearing house members are typically confirmed and novated shortly after execution, at which point the clearing house assumes the risk of settlement. For transactions with counterparties that are not members of the third-party clearing house, settlement typically occurs on the day following execution and, prior to settlement, BrokerTec Americas is exposed to the risk of loss in the event a counterparty fails to meet its obligations. If that were to occur, BrokerTec Americas would have the right to cover or liquidate the open position but could incur a loss as a result of market movements.Foreign Currency Exchange Rate RiskForeign Currency Transaction Risk We have foreign currency transaction risk related to changes in exchange rates on monetary assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses held at subsidiaries where those balances and activity are denominated in a currency other than the subsidiary's functional currency. Gains and losses on foreign currency transactions result primarily from cash, debt and other monetary assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses denominated in British pounds, euros and Japanese yen. Aggregate transaction losses for 2020, 2019 and 2018 were $9.3 million, $7.2 million and $73.6 million, respectively. We expect the foreign currency gain/loss to continue to fluctuate as long as we continue to hold monetary assets and liabilities at those subsidiaries. Brexit continues to generate economic and political uncertainty throughout the world, particularly throughout the U.K. and the E.U. This uncertainty could potentially lead to significant volatility with foreign currency exchange rates, which could result in additional foreign currency gain/loss. Foreign Currency Translation Risk We have foreign currency translation risk related to the translation of our foreign subsidiaries' assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses from their respective functional currencies to the U.S. dollar at each reporting date. Fluctuations in exchange rates may impact the amount of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses we report on our consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of income. The financial statements of those foreign subsidiaries with functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars using a current exchange rate. Gains and losses resulting from this translation are recognized as a foreign currency translation adjustment within accumulated other comprehensive income, which is a component of shareholders' equity and comprehensive income. Aggregate translation gains (losses), net of tax, for 2020, 2019 and 2018 were $134.3 million, $(0.6) million and $(2.5) million, respectively. 48Table of ContentsForeign Currency Exchange Risk Related to Customer CollateralA portion of performance bond deposits is denominated in various foreign currencies. We mark-to-market all deposits daily and require payment from clearing firms whose collateral has lost value due to changes in foreign currency rates and price. Therefore, our exposure to foreign currency risk related to performance bond deposits is considered minimal and is not expected to be material to our financial condition or operating results.49Table of Contents",2023-12-30 20:16:19.645323

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSINTRODUCTIONManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is organized as follows:•Executive Summary: Includes an overview of our business; current economic, competitive and regulatory trends relevant to our business; our current business strategy; and our primary sources of operating and non-operating revenues and expenses.•Critical Accounting Policies: Provides an explanation of accounting policies that may have a significant impact on our financial results and the estimates, assumptions and risks associated with those policies.•Results of Operations: Includes an analysis of our 2021 financial results and a discussion of any known events or trends that are likely to impact future results.•Liquidity and Capital Resources: Includes a discussion of our future cash requirements, capital resources, significant planned expenditures and financing arrangements.References in this discussion and analysis to ""we"" and ""our"" are to CME Group Inc. (CME Group) and its consolidated subsidiaries, collectively. References to ""exchange"" are to Chicago Mercantile Exchange Inc. (CME), the Board of Trade of the City of Chicago, Inc. (CBOT), New York Mercantile Exchange, Inc. (NYMEX) and Commodity Exchange, Inc. (COMEX), collectively, unless otherwise noted. EXECUTIVE SUMMARYBusiness OverviewCME Group, a Delaware stock corporation, is the holding company for CME, CBOT, NYMEX, COMEX, NEX and their respective subsidiaries. The holding company structure is designed to provide strategic and operational flexibility. CME Group's Class A common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market (Nasdaq) under the ticker symbol ""CME."" Our exchange consists of designated contract markets for the trading of futures and options contracts. We also clear futures, options and swaps contracts through our clearing house. Futures contracts, options contracts and swaps contracts provide investors with vehicles for protecting against, and potentially profiting from, price changes in financial instruments and physical commodities. We are a global company with customer access available virtually all over the world. Our customers consist of professional traders, financial institutions, individual and institutional investors, major corporations, manufacturers, producers, governments and central banks. Customers include both members of the exchange and non-members. We offer our customers the opportunity to trade futures contracts and options contracts on a range of products, including those based on interest rates, equity indexes, foreign exchange, agricultural commodities, energy and metals. Through our cash markets business, we offer fixed income trading through BrokerTec and foreign currency trading through EBS. Our products provide a means for hedging, speculating and allocating assets. We identify new products by monitoring economic trends and their impact on the risk management and speculative needs of our existing and prospective customers. Most of our products are available for trading through our electronic trading platforms. These execution facilities offer our customers immediate trade execution and price transparency. In addition, trades can be executed through privately negotiated transactions that are cleared and settled through our clearing house. Prior to September 2021, we provided optimization services that delivered transaction lifecycle management and information services to help our customers optimize their capital, mitigate their risk and reduce operational costs. Optimization services included Traiana, TriOptima and Reset. In September 2021, we contributed the net assets of our optimization business to OSTTRA, our new joint venture with IHS Markit.Our clearing house clears, settles and guarantees futures and options contracts traded through our exchanges, in addition to cleared swaps products. Our clearing house's performance guarantee is an important function of our business. Because of this guarantee, our customers do not need to evaluate the credit of each potential counterparty or limit themselves to a selected set of counterparties. This flexibility increases the potential liquidity available for each trade. Additionally, the substitution of our clearing house as the counterparty to every transaction allows our customers to establish a position with one party and offset the position with another party. This contract offsetting process provides our customers with flexibility in establishing and adjusting positions and provides for collateral and margining efficiencies. Certain BrokerTec and EBS contracts are cleared at third-party clearing houses. 30Table of ContentsBusiness TrendsEconomic Environment. Our customers continue to use our markets as an effective and transparent means to manage risk and meet their investment needs. Trading activity in our centralized markets has fluctuated due to the ongoing uncertainty in the financial markets, fluctuations in the availability of credit, variations in the amount of assets under management as well as the Federal Reserve Bank’s interest rate policy and quantitative easing. We continue to maintain high quality and diverse products as well as various clearing and market data services, which support our customers in any economic environment. Competitive Environment. Our industry is competitive and we continue to encounter competition in all aspects of our business. We expect competition to continue to intensify, especially in light of ongoing regulatory reform in the financial services industry. Competition is influenced by our brand and reputation; the efficiency and security of our settlement, clearing and support services; depth and liquidity of our markets; diversity of product offerings, including frequency and quality of new product development and innovative services; our ability to position and expand upon existing products to address changing market needs; efficient and seamless customer experience; transparency, reliability, anonymity and security of transaction processing; the regulatory environment; connectivity, accessibility, flexibility in execution methods and distribution; and technology capability and innovation, as well as overall transaction costs. We believe we are very well positioned with respect to these factors. Our asset classes contain products designed to address differing risk management needs, and customers are able to achieve operational and capital efficiencies by accessing our diverse products through our platforms and our clearing house. We face competition from other futures, securities and securities option exchanges; clearing organizations; swap execution facilities; alternative trade execution facilities; technology firms, including market data distributors and electronic trading system developers; and others. As markets continue to evolve, we will continue to adapt our trading technology and clearing services to meet the needs of our customers. The competitive environment to which we are subject is discussed in ""Item 1. Business"" on page 10.Regulatory Environment. Our exchange-traded derivatives exchanges and other businesses are regulated and we serve a customer base that includes regulated institutions and individuals. Developments in the regulatory environment have the potential to significantly impact our business. Compliance with regulations may require us and our customers to dedicate significant financial and operational resources, which could adversely affect our profitability. The regulatory environment to which we are subject is discussed in ""Item 1. Business"" on page 11.Business StrategyOur strategy focuses on maximizing futures and options growth globally, diversifying our business and revenues and delivering unparalleled customer efficiencies and operational excellence, including through our partnership with Google Cloud. This strategy allows us to continue to develop into a more broadly diversified financial exchange that provides trading and clearing solutions across a wide range of products and asset classes. Our strategic initiatives are discussed in ""Item 1. Business"" on page 7. RevenuesClearing and transaction fees. A majority of our revenue is derived from clearing and transaction fees, which include electronic trading fees, surcharges for privately negotiated transactions and other volume-related charges for exchange-traded and over-the-counter (OTC) contracts. Because clearing and transaction fees are assessed on a per-contract or notional value basis, revenues and profitability fluctuate with changes in contract volume. In addition to the business trends noted earlier, our contract volume, and consequently our revenues, tend to increase during periods of economic and geopolitical uncertainty as our customers seek to manage their exposure to, or speculate on, the market volatility resulting from that uncertainty. While volume has the most significant impact on our clearing and transaction fees revenue, there are four other factors that also influence this source of revenue: •rate structure;•product mix;•venue; and•the percentage of trades executed by customers who are members compared with non-member customers.Rate structure. Customers benefit from volume discounts and limits on fees as part of our effort to increase liquidity in certain products. We offer various incentive programs to promote trading and clearing in various products and geographic locations. We may periodically change fees, volume discounts, fee limits and member discounts, perhaps significantly, based on our review of operations and the business environment. Product mix. We offer exchange-traded futures and options contracts as well as cleared-only interest rate swap contracts. We also offer foreign exchange spot and forward contracts and fixed income products. Rates are varied by product in order to optimize revenue on existing products and to encourage contract volume upon introduction of new products. 31Table of ContentsVenue. Our exchange and platforms are an international marketplace that brings together buyers and sellers mainly through our electronic trading as well as through open outcry trading and privately negotiated transactions. Any customer who is guaranteed by a clearing firm and who agrees to be bound by our exchange rules is able to obtain direct access to our electronic platforms. Open outcry trading is conducted exclusively by our members, who may execute trades on behalf of customers or for themselves. Beginning in May 2021, open outcry trading is now limited to Eurodollar options and Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) options products following the permanent closure of most of our open outcry pits. Typically, customers submitting trades through our electronic platforms are charged fees for using the platforms in addition to the fees assessed on all transactions executed on our exchange. Customers entering into privately negotiated transactions also incur additional charges beyond the fees assessed on other transactions. Member/non-member mix. Generally, member customers are charged lower fees than our non-member customers. Holding all other factors constant, revenue decreases if the percentage of trades executed by members increases, and increases if the percentage of non-member trades increases. Clearing and transaction fees for cash markets business. Our cash markets business provides matching services whereby we match a buyer and seller of financial instruments to allow both parties to complete the trade bilaterally or through a third-party clearing house. We are not involved in the settlement of the contract but charge a transaction fee generally based on volume or notional value of the trade for providing the matching service. The cash markets business includes BrokerTec Americas, which generates revenue from a matched principal business. This business serves as a fully matched counterparty to offsetting positions entered into by clients on its electronic trading platform to facilitate anonymity and access to clearing and settlement. Revenue is generated from this business generally on a transaction fee basis. Other sources. Revenue is also derived from other sources, including market data and information services and other various services related to our exchange operations. Market data and information services. We receive market data and information services revenue from the dissemination of our market data to subscribers. Subscribers can obtain access to our market data services either directly or through third-party distributors. Our service offerings include access to real-time, delayed and end-of-day quotations, trade and summary market data for our products and other data sources. Users of our basic service receive real-time quotes and pay a flat monthly fee for each screen, or device, displaying our market data. Alternatively, customers can subscribe to market data provided on a limited group of products. The fee for this service is also a flat rate per month.Pricing for our market data services is based on the value of the service provided and the price of comparable services offered by our competitors. Increases or decreases in our market data and information services revenue are influenced by changes in our price structure and incentive programs for existing market data offerings, introduction of new market data services and changes in the number of devices in use. General economic factors that affect the financial services industry, which constitutes our primary customer base, also influence revenue from our market data services. Other revenues. Other revenue includes access and communication fees. Access and communication fees are connectivity fees charged to members and clearing firms that utilize our various telecommunications networks and communications services. Our communication services include our co-location program as well as the connectivity charges to customers of the CME Globex platform. Access fee revenue varies depending on the type of connection provided to customers. Prior to the contribution of the net assets of our optimization business to OSTTRA, other revenues included revenues from our optimization services, which included fees for risk management and information services for the OTC markets, including portfolio reconciliation and post-trade processing. Revenue earned from these services was typically generated through subscriptions or transaction fees. Other revenues also include fees for collateral management, equity subscription fees and fees for trade order routing through agreements from various strategic relationships as well as other services to members and clearing firms.ExpensesThe majority of our expenses do not vary directly with changes in our contract volume. However, licensing and other fee agreements can vary directly with certain equity, energy and swap volumes, and the majority of our employee bonuses vary indirectly with overall contract volume, as bonuses are primarily based on our financial performance. Compensation and benefits. Compensation and benefits expense is our most significant expense and includes employee wages, bonuses, stock-based compensation, benefits and employer taxes. Changes in this expense are driven by fluctuations in the number of employees, increases in wages as a result of inflation or labor market conditions, changes in rates for employer taxes and other cost increases affecting benefit plans. In addition, this expense is affected by the composition of our workforce. 32Table of ContentsThe expense associated with our bonus and stock-based compensation plans can also have a significant impact on this expense category. The bonus component of our compensation and benefits expense is based on our financial performance. Under the performance criteria of our annual incentive plans, the bonus funded under the plans is based on achieving certain financial performance targets established by the compensation committee of our board of directors. The compensation committee has discretion to make equitable adjustments to the cash earnings performance calculation to reflect effects of unplanned operating results or capital expenditures to meet intermediate- to long-term growth opportunities. In general, stock-based compensation is a non-cash expense related to restricted stock and performance share grants. Stock-based compensation varies depending on the quantity and fair value of awards granted. The fair value of restricted stock awards and other performance share grants is based on either the share price on the date of the grant or a model of expected future stock prices. Professional fees and outside services. This expense includes fees for consulting services received on strategic and technology initiatives; regulatory and other compliance matters; temporary labor as well as legal and accounting fees. This expense may fluctuate as a result of changes in services required to complete initiatives, handle legal proceedings and comply with regulatory and compliance requirements.Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense results from the depreciation of long-lived assets such as buildings, leasehold improvements, furniture, fixtures and equipment. This expense also includes the amortization of purchased and internally developed software. Amortization of purchased intangibles. Amortization of purchased intangibles includes amortization of intangible assets obtained in our acquisitions of CBOT Holdings, Inc., NYMEX Holdings, Inc. and NEX as well as other asset and business acquisitions. Intangible assets subject to amortization consist primarily of clearing firm, market data and other customer relationships. Other expenses. We incur additional ongoing expenses for communications, technology support services and various other activities necessary to support our operations. •Technology expense consists of costs related to maintenance of the hardware and software required to support our technology. It also includes costs for network connections for our electronic platforms and some market data customers; telecommunications costs of our exchange, and fees paid for access to external market data. This expense may be driven by system capacity, functionality and redundancy requirements. It also may be impacted by growth in electronic contract volume and changes in the number of telecommunications hubs and connections which allow customers outside the U.S. to access our electronic platforms directly. •Licensing and other fee agreements expense includes license fees paid as a result of contract volume in equity index products. This expense also includes royalty fees and broker rebates on energy and metals products, as well as revenue sharing on cleared swaps contracts and some new product launches. This expense fluctuates with changes in contract volumes as well as changes in fee structures. •Other expenses include occupancy and building operations expenses including rent, maintenance, real estate taxes, utilities and other related costs related to leased property in Chicago, New York, the U.K., and India, as well as other smaller locations throughout the world. Other expenses also include marketing and travel-related expenses as well as general and administrative costs. Marketing, advertising and public relations expense includes media, print and other advertising costs, as well as costs associated with our product promotion. Other expenses also include litigation and customer settlements, impairment charges on operating assets, gains and losses on disposals of certain operating assets, and foreign currency transaction gains and losses resulting from changes in exchange rates on certain foreign monetary assets and liabilities.Non-Operating Income and ExpensesIncome and expenses incurred through activities outside of our core operations are considered non-operating. These activities include non-core investing and financing activities. •Investment income includes income from short-term investment of clearing firms' cash performance bonds and guaranty fund contributions as well as excess operating cash; interest income and realized gains and losses from our marketable securities; realized gains and losses and dividend income from our strategic equity investments, and gains and losses on trading securities in our non-qualified deferred compensation plans. Investment income is influenced by market interest rates, changes in the levels of cash performance bonds deposited by clearing firms, the amount of dividends distributed by our strategic investments and the availability of funds generated by operations. 33Table of Contents•Interest and other borrowing costs expense includes charges associated with various short-term and long-term funding facilities, including commitment fees on lines of credit agreements.•Equity in net earnings (losses) of unconsolidated subsidiaries includes income and losses from our investments in OSTTRA, S&P/Dow Jones Indices LLC (S&P/DJI), Shanghai CFETS-NEX International Money Broking Co., Ltd. and Dubai Mercantile Exchange.•Other income (expense) includes expenses related to the distribution of a portion of interest earned on performance bond collateral reinvestment to the clearing firms, gains and losses on derivative contracts and other various income and expenses outside our core operations.CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIESThe notes to our consolidated financial statements include disclosure of our significant accounting policies. In establishing these policies within the framework of accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., management must make certain assessments, estimates and choices that will result in the application of these principles in a manner that appropriately reflects our financial condition and results of operations. Critical accounting policies are those policies that we believe present the most complex or subjective measurements and have the most potential to affect our financial position and operating results. While all decisions regarding accounting policies are important, there are certain accounting policies that we consider to be critical. These critical policies, which are presented in detail in the notes to our consolidated financial statements, relate to the valuation of financial instruments, goodwill and intangible assets, revenue recognition, income taxes and internal use software costs. Valuation of financial instruments. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, or an exit price. We have categorized financial instruments measured at fair value into the following three-level fair value hierarchy based upon the level of judgment associated with the inputs used to measure the fair value: •Level 1 inputs, which are considered the most reliable evidence of fair value, consist of quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets. •Level 2 inputs consist of observable market data, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, or inputs other than quoted prices that are directly observable. •Level 3 inputs consist of unobservable inputs, which are derived and cannot be corroborated by market data or other entity-specific inputs.For further discussion regarding the fair value of financial assets and liabilities, see note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and note 17. Fair Value Measurements to the consolidated financial statements. Goodwill and intangible assets. We review goodwill for impairment on a quarterly basis and whenever events or circumstances indicate that its carrying value may not be recoverable. Goodwill may be tested quantitatively for impairment by comparing the carrying value of a reporting unit to its estimated fair value. Estimating the fair value of a reporting unit involves the use of valuation techniques that rely on significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions may include forecasted revenue growth rates; forecasted operating margins; risk-adjusted discount rates; forecasted economic and market conditions; and industry multiples. We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable given the information that is available to us at the time of our assessment; however, actual future results may differ significantly from those estimates. Under certain favorable circumstances, goodwill may be reviewed qualitatively for indications of impairment without utilizing valuation techniques to estimate fair value. The qualitative assessment of goodwill may rely on significant assumptions about forecasts of revenue growth, operating margins and economic conditions as well as overall market and industry-specific trends. In addition, the carrying value of goodwill, as denominated in foreign currencies, is adjusted each reporting period as a result of movements in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar. Such foreign currency translation adjustments are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within shareholders' equity.We also review indefinite-lived intangible assets on a quarterly basis or more frequently when events and circumstances indicate that their carrying values may not be recoverable. Indefinite-lived intangible assets may be tested quantitatively for impairment by comparing their carrying values to their estimated fair values. Estimating the fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets involves the use of valuation techniques that rely on significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions may include forecasted revenue growth rates, forecasted allocations of expense and risk-adjusted discount rates. We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable given the information that is available to us at the time of our assessment; however, actual future results may differ significantly from those estimates. Similar to goodwill, under certain favorable circumstances, indefinite-lived intangible assets may be reviewed qualitatively for indications of impairment without utilizing valuation techniques to estimate fair value. The qualitative assessment of indefinite-lived intangible assets may rely on significant assumptions about forecasts of revenue growth, operating margins and economic conditions as well as overall market and industry-specific trends.34Table of ContentsIntangible assets subject to amortization are also assessed for impairment on a quarterly basis or more frequently when indicated by a change in economic or operational circumstances. The impairment assessment of these assets requires management to first compare the carrying value of the amortizing asset to its undiscounted net cash flows. If the carrying value exceeds the undiscounted net cash flows, management is then required to estimate the fair value of the assets and record an impairment loss for the excess of the carrying value over the fair value. In connection with this impairment assessment, management also challenges the useful lives of our definite-lived intangible assets on a periodic basis. Revenue recognition. A significant portion of our revenue is derived from the clearing and transaction fees we assess on each contract executed through our trading venues and cleared through our clearing house. Clearing and transaction fees are recognized as revenue when a buy and sell order are matched and when the trade is cleared. On occasion, the customer's exchange trading privileges may not be properly entered by the clearing firm and incorrect fees are charged for the transactions in the affected accounts. When this information is corrected within the time period allowed by the exchange, a fee adjustment is provided to the clearing firm. A reserve is established for estimated fee adjustments to reflect corrections to customer exchange trading privileges. This reserve has historically been immaterial. The reserve is based on the historical pattern of adjustments processed as well as management's estimate of future adjustment activity.Income taxes. Calculation of the income tax provision includes an estimate of the income taxes that will be paid for the current year, as well as an estimate of income tax liabilities or benefits deferred into future years. Deferred tax assets are reviewed to determine if they will be realized in future periods. To the extent it is determined that some deferred tax assets may not be fully realized, the assets are reduced to their realizable value by a valuation allowance. The calculation of our tax provision involves uncertainty in the application of complex tax regulations and we occasionally may consult with relevant tax authorities or engage third-party expertise where appropriate. We recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the United States and other applicable foreign tax jurisdictions using a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold based on the technical merits of the tax position taken or expected to be taken. If the actual obligation of these amounts varies from our estimate, our income tax provision would be reduced or increased at the time that determination is made. This determination may not be known for several years. Past tax audits have not resulted in tax adjustments that resulted in a material change to the income tax provision in the year the audit was completed. The effective tax rate, defined as the income tax provision as a percentage of income before income taxes, will vary from year to year based on changes in tax jurisdictions, tax rates and regulations. In addition, the effective tax rate will vary with changes to income that are not subject to income tax and changes in expenses or losses that are not deductible, such as the utilization of foreign net operating losses. Internal use software costs. Certain internal and external costs that are incurred in connection with developing or obtaining software for internal use are capitalized. We also enter into software hosting arrangements for software projects maintained in the cloud. Software development costs incurred during the planning or maintenance stages of a software project are expensed as incurred, while costs incurred during the application development stage are capitalized and are amortized over the estimated useful life of the software, which is generally two to four years, but up to eight years for certain trading and clearing applications, depending upon expected useful lives. Amortization of capitalized costs begins only when the software becomes ready for its intended use. In addition, software assets are assessed for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying values may not be recoverable or that a reduction in the estimated useful lives is warranted.35Table of ContentsRESULTS OF OPERATIONSFinancial HighlightsThe following summarizes significant changes in our financial performance for the years presented.

Total contract volume includes contracts that are traded on our exchange and cleared through our clearing house and certain cleared-only contracts. Volume is measured in round turns, which is considered a completed transaction that involves a purchase and an offsetting sale of a contract. Average rate per contract is determined by dividing total clearing and transaction fees by total contract volume. Contract volume and average rate per contract disclosures below exclude trading volume for the cash markets business as well as interest rate swaps.

Due to the relationship between average rate per contract and contract volume, the change in clearing and transaction fees attributable to changes in each is only an approximation.Contract VolumeThe following table summarizes average daily contract volume. Contract volume can be influenced by many factors, including political and economic factors, the regulatory environment and market competition.

In mid-2021, the Federal Reserve indicated a potential increase in interest rates earlier than many market participants expected, which resulted in higher volatility within the interest rate market. However, volatility remained lower in other markets throughout much of 2021. Equity market volatility was higher in 2020 as a result of the governmental and business response to the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, a continued rebalance and reduction in demand in the crude oil market as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in lower market volatility within the energy market in 2021. We believe these factors led to the changes in volume in 2021 when compared with 2020. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, in March 2020 we closed our open outcry trading floor and reopened it in August 2020 for Eurodollar options. In May 2021, we announced our decision to permanently close the trading floor outside of Eurodollar options and Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) options.37Table of ContentsInterest Rate ProductsThe following table summarizes average daily contract volume for our key interest rate products. Eurodollar front 8 contracts include contracts expiring within two years. Eurodollar back 32 contracts include contracts expiring within three to ten years.

Prior period amounts have been revised to conform to the current period presentation. In 2021 when compared with 2020, overall interest rate contract volume increased due to higher overall interest rate volatility resulting from changes in market expectations. We believe interest rate volatility increased following the Federal Reserve's indication that it would maintain its zero interest rate policy in the short term and potentially raise interest rates sooner than expected. In addition, we believe the increase in U.S. Treasury contract volume was due to a record level of U.S. Treasury issuances, which has led to an increased need for market participants to manage their risk across the treasury yield curve.Equity Index ProductsThe following table summarizes average daily contract volume for our key equity index products. Year-over-Year Change(amounts in thousands)202120202021-2020E-mini S&P 500 futures and options3,1723,555(11)%E-mini Nasdaq 100 futures and options1,5341,30218 E-mini Russell 2000 futures and options36830222 In 2021 when compared with 2020, equity index contract volume decreased slightly due to overall lower volatility. We believe the volatility within the broad-based indexes, including the S&P 500, subsided in 2021 following significant equity market volatility in early 2020 resulting from uncertainty surrounding the economic impact of governmental and business actions to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. However, there was an increase in volatility within certain narrow-based technology and small cap indexes, which resulted from a market repricing of certain stocks in early 2021. We believe this increase in volatility contributed to an increase in the E-mini Nasdaq 100 and E-mini Russell 2000 contract volume in 2021.

Market volatility subsided in the second half of 2021 following periods of higher volatility in 2020 and early 2021 as crop supplies met demand following the 2021 growing season and COVID-19 related supply chain disruptions were corrected.

We believe this was due to a continued rebalance and reduction in demand in the crude oil markets as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, forecasts of warmer than expected weather resulted in a decrease in natural gas contract volume compared with 2020. We believe these factors led to the overall decrease in energy volume. Metal ProductsThe following table summarizes average daily volume for our key metal products.Year-over-Year Change(amounts in thousands)202120202021-2020Gold330456(28)%Copper101983 Silver95123(23)Lower overall market volatility within the gold and silver markets contributed to the overall decline in metal contract volume in 2021 when compared with 2020. Volatility was higher in 2020, as investors used gold and other precious metals as safe-haven investments as a result of uncertainty within other markets caused by the governmental and business actions to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. Average Rate per ContractThe average rate per contract was lower in 2021 when compared with 2020. The decrease in the average rate per contract was primarily due to a change in product mix. Interest rate contract volume increased by 5 percentage points as a percent of total volume, while all other products collectively decreased by 5 percentage points. In general, interest rate products have a lower rate per contract compared with the remaining contracts. 39Table of ContentsCash Markets BusinessTotal clearing and transaction fees revenue in 2021 includes $396.2 million of transaction fees attributable to the cash markets business, compared with $447.4 million in 2020. This revenue primarily includes BrokerTecs's fixed income volume and EBS foreign exchange volume.Year-over-Year Change(amounts in millions)202120202021-2020BrokerTec fixed income transaction fees$172.0 $173.2 (1)%EBS foreign exchange transaction fees164.3 179.3 (8)%The related average daily notional value for the years ended 2021 and 2020 for key cash markets products were as follows:Year-over-Year Change(amounts in billions)202120202021-2020U.S. Treasury$115.0 $125.9 (9)%European Repo (in euros)292.3 264.4 11 %Spot FX61.2 71.5 (14)%Overall average daily notional value for the cash markets business increased slightly in 2021 when compared with 2020. The increase in European Repo transactions was largely due to increased volatility as a result of the European Union unexpectedly leaving interest rates unchanged. We believe the decreases in U.S. Treasury and Spot FX volumes are primarily due to lower levels of volatility following periods of higher volatility in early 2020 caused by significant uncertainty surrounding the economic impacts of the governmental and business actions to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the increase in average daily notional value, transaction revenue decreased due to the tiered pricing structure and incentive rate programs. Concentration of RevenueWe bill a significant portion of our clearing and transaction fees to our clearing firms. The majority of clearing and transaction fees received from clearing firms represent charges for trades executed and cleared on behalf of their customers. One clearing firm represented approximately 10% of our clearing and transaction fees in 2021. Should a clearing firm withdraw, we believe that the customer portion of the firm's trading activity would likely transfer to another clearing firm of the exchange. Therefore, we do not believe we are exposed to significant risk from an ongoing loss of revenue received from or through a particular clearing firm. Other Sources of RevenueMarket data and information services. In 2021 when compared with 2020, the increase in market data and information services revenue was largely attributable to an increase in certain device fees.The two largest resellers of our market data represented, in aggregate, approximately 34% of our market data and information services revenue in 2021. Despite this concentration, we consider exposure to significant risk of revenue loss to be minimal. In the event that one of these vendors no longer subscribes to our market data, we believe the majority of that vendor's customers would likely subscribe to our market data through another reseller. Additionally, several of our largest institutional customers that utilize services from our two largest resellers report usage and remit payment of their fees directly to us.Other revenues. The decrease in other revenues in 2021 when compared with 2020 was largely attributable to the deconsolidation of the optimization business in September 2021 as part of the contribution of the business's net assets to OSTTRA, our joint venture with IHS Markit. 40Table of ContentsExpenses Year-over-Year Change(dollars in millions)202120202021-2020Compensation and benefits$837.0 $856.5 (2)%Technology192.6 198.5 (3)Professional fees and outside services151.7 191.3 (21)Amortization of purchased intangibles237.6 311.2 (24)Depreciation and amortization147.8 153.2 (4)Licensing and other fee agreements236.9 244.9 (3)Other240.9 290.6 (17)Total Expenses$2,044.5 $2,246.2 (9)2021 Compared With 2020Operating expenses decreased by $201.7 million in 2021 when compared with 2020.

Amortization was no longer taken on these intangible assets once they were classified as held for sale in January 2021 following approval of the contribution by the company's board of directors.•Professional fees and outside services expenses decreased due to a greater reliance on consultants for platform integrations, information security and systems enhancements in 2020, as well as a reduction in legal fees related to our business activities and product offerings. •Salaries, benefits and employer taxes were lower during 2021 when compared to 2020 due to higher reductions in workforce and the contribution of employees from CME Group's optimization businesses to the new joint venture with IHS Markit in September 2021.•In 2020, we recognized higher impairment charges on certain intangible assets and fixed assets related to a subsidiary.•Decreases in stock-based compensation expense were primarily due to higher forfeitures resulting from reductions in headcount compared to 2020.Increases in operating expenses in 2021 when compared with 2020 were as follows:•Employee separation and retention costs were higher during 2021 due to a higher reduction in workforce compared to 2020.•Bonus expenses increased in 2021 largely due to performance relative to our 2021 cash earnings target when compared with 2020 performance relative to our 2020 cash earnings target.41Table of ContentsNon-Operating Income (Expense) Year-over-Year Change(dollars in millions)202120202021-2020Investment income$306.9 $182.7 68 %Interest and other borrowing costs(166.9)(166.2)— Equity in net earnings (losses) of unconsolidated subsidiaries245.8 190.6 29 Other income (expense)342.6 (122.4)n.m.Total Non-Operating$728.4 $84.7 n.m._________n.m. not meaningfulInvestment income.

In September 2021, we also began recognizing our share of net earnings in our investment in OSTTRA, our new joint venture with IHS Markit. Other income (expense). In 2021, we recognized a net gain of $400.7 million on the deconsolidation and contribution of our optimization business to OSTTRA, which contributed to an increase in other income in 2021. We also recognized a gain of $30.4 million related to the sale of a building in Chicago in the fourth quarter of 2021, as well as proceeds from a legal settlement.Income Tax ProvisionThe following table summarizes the effective tax rate for the periods presented: 20212020Year-over-Year Change2021-2020Year ended December 3121.8 %22.6 %(0.8)%The effective tax rate decreased in 2021 when compared with 2020. In 2021, we recognized a gain on the deconsolidation and contribution of our optimization business to OSTTRA, which was not taxable. The decrease due to the gain was partially offset by an increase to the statutory rate in the United Kingdom. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESCash RequirementsWe have historically met our funding requirements with cash generated by our ongoing operations. However, we have used our commercial paper program from time to time to fund large short-term funding needs, including our acquisition of NEX in 2018. While our cost structure is generally fixed in the short term, our sources of operating cash are largely dependent on contract trading volume levels. In addition to using our existing cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and cash generated from operations, we may continue to utilize our commercial paper program to meet our working capital needs, capital expenditures and other commitments. It is also possible that we may need to raise additional funds to finance our activities through future public debt offerings or by direct borrowings from financial institutions through our committed revolving credit facilities.42Table of ContentsCash will also be required for non-cancellable purchase obligations as at December 31, 2021. Commitments include material contractual purchase obligations that are non-cancellable. Purchase obligations relate to advertising, licensing, hardware, software and maintenance as well as telecommunication services. Aside from the table below, we have certain other arrangements that have a perpetual term for which we pay $5.0 million per year. At December 31, 2021, future minimum payments due under purchase obligations were payable as follows (in millions): Year 2022$107.6 2023-2024145.3 2025-2026214.2 Thereafter839.3 Total$1,306.4 Future capital expenditures for technology are anticipated as we continue to support our growth through increased system capacity, performance improvements, integration of acquired platforms and improvements to some of our office spaces. Each year, capital expenditures are incurred for improvements to and modification of our offices, remote data centers, telecommunications network and other operating equipment. In 2022, we expect capital expenditures to total approximately $140.0 million to $150.0 million, net of any leasehold improvement allowances. We continue to monitor our capital needs and may revise our forecasted expenditures as necessary in the future. We intend to continue to pay a regular quarterly dividend to our shareholders, with a target of between 50% to 60% of the prior year's cash earnings. The decision to pay a dividend and the amount of the dividend, however, remains within the discretion of our board of directors and may be affected by various factors, including our earnings, financial condition, capital requirements, levels of indebtedness and other considerations our board of directors deems relevant. We are also required to comply with restrictions contained in the general corporation laws of our state of incorporation, which could limit our ability to declare and pay dividends. On February 3, 2022, the board of directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of $1.00 per share for all outstanding common and preferred shares. The dividend will be payable on March 25, 2022 to shareholders of record on March 10, 2022. Assuming no changes in the number of shares outstanding, the first quarter dividend payment will total approximately $363.0 million. The board of directors also declared an additional, annual variable dividend of $3.25 per share on December 9, 2021 paid on January 14, 2022 to the shareholders of record on December 28, 2021. In general, the amount of the annual variable dividend will be determined by the end of each year, and the level will increase or decrease from year to year based on operating results, capital expenditures, potential merger and acquisition activity and other forms of capital return, including regular dividends and share buybacks during the prior year. Sources and Uses of CashThe following is a summary of cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities. Year-over-Year Change(dollars in millions)202120202021-2020Net cash provided by operating activities$2,402.4 $2,715.6 (12)%Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities58.4 (175.5)133 Net cash provided by financing activities69,908.7 47,246.6 48 Operating activitiesNet cash provided by operating activities was lower in 2021 compared with 2020, largely due to a decrease in clearing and transaction fee revenue and other revenue. We also contributed the operating net assets of the optimization business to OSTTRA in the third quarter of 2021, which resulted in a net decrease in operating cash flow. In addition, our income tax payments were higher in 2021 compared with 2020. Investing activitiesThe increase in cash provided by investing activities in 2021 compared with 2020 was largely due to the net cash received from the OSTTRA joint venture transaction of $100.7 million and the additional proceeds received from sales of investments in 2021. In addition, our purchases of fixed assets were lower in 2021 when compared with 2020. Financing activitiesCash provided by financing activities was higher in 2021 when compared with 2020 mainly due to an increase in cash performance bonds and guaranty fund contributions. In addition, we received proceeds of $965.0 million from the issuance of 43Table of Contentspreferred shares in connection with our partnership with Google Cloud. The increase in cash provided by financing activities was partially offset by a reduction in the amount of outstanding commercial paper in 2020. For discussion regarding the revision of the presentation of the consolidated statements of cash flow to include cash performance bonds and guaranty fund contributions, see note 2.

The proceeds from this facility can be used for general corporate purposes, which includes providing liquidity for our clearing house in certain circumstances at CME Group's discretion and, if necessary, for maturities of commercial paper. As long as we are not in default under this facility, we have the option to increase it up to $3.3 billion with the consent of the agent and lenders providing the additional funds. This facility is voluntarily pre-payable from time to time without premium or penalty. Under this facility, we are required to remain in compliance with a consolidated net worth test, which is defined as our consolidated shareholders' equity at September 30, 2021, giving effect to share repurchases made and special dividends paid during the term of the agreements (and in no event greater than $2.0 billion in aggregate), multiplied by 0.65. We currently do not have any borrowings outstanding under this facility, but any commercial paper balance if or when outstanding can be backstopped against this facility.We maintain a 364-day multi-currency revolving secured credit facility with a consortium of domestic and international banks to be used in certain situations by the clearing house. The facility provides for borrowings of up to $7.0 billion. We may use the proceeds to provide temporary liquidity in the unlikely event a clearing firm fails to promptly discharge an obligation to CME Clearing, in the event of a liquidity constraint or default by a depositary (custodian for our collateral), in the event of a temporary disruption with the domestic payments system that would delay payment of settlement variation between us and our clearing firms, or in other cases as provided by the CME rulebook. Clearing firm guaranty fund contributions received in the form of cash or U.S. Treasury securities as well as the performance bond assets (pursuant to the CME rulebook) can be used to collateralize the facility. At December 31, 2021, guaranty fund contributions available to collateralize the facility totaled $9.7 billion. We have the option to request an increase in the line from $7.0 billion to $10.0 billion. Our 364-day facility contains a requirement that CME remain in compliance with a consolidated tangible net worth test, defined as CME consolidated shareholder's equity less intangible assets (as defined in the agreement), of not less than $800.0 million. We currently do not have any borrowings outstanding under this facility.The indentures governing our fixed rate notes, our $2.3 billion multi-currency revolving senior credit facility and our 364-day multi-currency revolving secured credit facility for $7.0 billion do not contain specific covenants that restrict the ability to pay dividends. These documents, however, do contain other customary financial and operating covenants that place restrictions on the operations of the company that could indirectly affect the ability to pay dividends.At December 31, 2021, we have excess borrowing capacity for general corporate purposes of approximately $2.3 billion under our multi-currency revolving senior credit facility.At December 31, 2021, we were in compliance with the various financial covenant requirements of all our debt facilities.CME Group, as a holding company, has no operations of its own. Instead, it relies on dividends declared and paid to it by its subsidiaries in order to provide the funds that it uses to pay dividends to its shareholders.44Table of ContentsTo satisfy our performance bond obligation with Singapore Exchange Limited, we may pledge irrevocable standby letters of credit. At December 31, 2021, the letters of credit totaled $330.0 million. We also maintain a $350.0 million line of credit to meet our obligations under this agreement.The following table summarizes our credit ratings as of December 31, 2021: Rating AgencyShort-TermDebt RatingLong-TermDebt RatingOutlookStandard & Poor’sA1+AA-StableMoody’s Investors ServiceP1Aa3StableGiven our cash flow generation, our ability to pay down debt levels and our ability to refinance existing debt facilities, if necessary, we expect to maintain an investment grade rating. If our ratings are downgraded below investment grade due to a change of control, we are required to make an offer to repurchase our fixed rate notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest.Liquidity and Cash ManagementCash and cash equivalents, excluding restricted cash, totaled $2.8 billion and $1.6 billion at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. The balance retained in cash and cash equivalents is a function of anticipated or possible short-term cash needs, prevailing interest rates, our corporate investment policy and alternative investment choices. A majority of our cash and cash equivalents balance is invested in money market mutual funds that invest only in U.S. Treasury securities, U.S. government agency securities and U.S. Treasury security reverse repurchase agreements and short-term bank deposits. Our exposure to credit and liquidity risk is minimal given the nature of the investments. Cash that is not available for general corporate purposes because of regulatory requirements or other restrictions is classified as restricted cash and is included in other current assets or other assets in the consolidated balance sheets.Our practice is to have our pension plan 100% funded at each year end on a projected benefit obligation basis, while also satisfying any minimum required contribution and obtaining the maximum tax deduction. Based on our actuarial projections, we estimate that no additional contribution will be necessary in 2022 to meet our funding goal. However, the amount of the actual contribution is contingent on various factors, including the actual rate of return on our plan assets during 2022 and the December 31, 2022 discount rate. Regulatory Requirements CME is regulated by the CFTC as a U.S. Derivatives Clearing Organization (DCO). DCOs are required to maintain capital, as defined by the CFTC, in an amount at least equal to one year of projected operating expenses as well as cash, liquid securities, or a line of credit at least equal to six months of projected operating expenses. CME was designated by the Financial Stability Oversight Council as a systemically important financial market utility under Title VIII of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. As a result, CME must comply with CFTC regulations applicable to a systemically important DCO for financial resources and liquidity resources. CME is in compliance with all DCO financial requirements.CME, CBOT, NYMEX and COMEX are regulated by the CFTC as Designated Contract Markets (DCM). DCMs are required to maintain capital, as defined by the CFTC, in an amount at least equal to one year of projected operating expenses as well as cash, liquid securities or a line of credit at least equal to six months of projected operating expenses. Our DCMs are in compliance with all DCM financial requirements.BrokerTec Americas LLC is required to maintain sufficient net capital under Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act), Rule 15c3-1 (the Net Capital Rule). The Net Capital Rule focuses on liquidity and is designed to protect securities customers, counterparties, and creditors by requiring that broker-dealers have sufficient liquid resources on hand at all times to satisfy claims promptly. Rule 15c3-3, or the customer protection rule, which complements Rule 15c3-1, is designed to ensure that customer property (securities and funds) in the custody of broker-dealers is adequately safeguarded. By law, both of these rules apply to the activities of registered broker dealers, but not to unregistered affiliates. The firm began operating as a (k)(2)(i) broker dealer in November 2017 following notification to the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority and the SEC. A company operating under the (k)(2)(i) exemption is not required to lock up customer funds as would otherwise be required under Exchange Act Rule 15c3-3.45Table of ContentsITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKWe are subject to various market risks, including those caused by changes in interest rates, credit and foreign currency exchange rates.Interest Rate Risk Debt outstanding at December 31, 2021 consisted of fixed-rate borrowings of $3.4 billion (in U.S. dollar equivalent). Changes in interest rates impact the fair values of fixed-rate debt, but do not impact earnings or cash flows. We did not have any variable-rate borrowings at December 31, 2021. Credit Risk CME Clearing HouseOur clearing house acts as the counterparty to all trades consummated on our exchanges as well as through third-party exchanges and swaps markets for which we provide clearing services. As a result, we are exposed to significant credit risk of third parties, including clearing firms. We are also exposed, indirectly, to the credit risk of customers of our clearing firms. These parties may default on their obligations due to bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, operational failure or other reasons. In order to ensure performance, we establish and monitor financial requirements for our clearing firms. We set minimum performance bond requirements for exchange-traded and interest rate swaps products. For clearing firms, we establish performance bond requirements to cover at least 99% of expected price changes for a given product within a given historical period with further quantitative and qualitative considerations based on market risk. We establish haircuts applied to collateral deposited to meet performance bond requirements to cover at least 99% of expected price changes and foreign currency changes for a given asset within a given historical period with further quantitative and qualitative considerations. Haircuts vary depending on the type of collateral and maturity. We mark-to-market open positions of clearing firms at least once a day (twice a day for futures and options contracts) and require payment from clearing firms whose positions have lost value and make payments to clearing firms whose positions have gained value. We have the capability to mark-to-market more frequently as market conditions warrant. These practices allow our clearing house to quickly identify any clearing firms that may not be able to satisfy the financial obligations resulting from changes in the prices of their open positions before those financial obligations become exceptionally large and jeopardize the ability of our clearing house to ensure performance of their open positions. Although we have policies and procedures to help ensure that our clearing firms can satisfy their obligations, these policies and procedures may not succeed in detecting problems or preventing defaults. We also have in place various measures intended to enable us to cover any default and maintain liquidity. Despite our safeguards, we cannot guarantee that these measures will be sufficient to protect us from a default or that we will not be materially and adversely affected in the event of a significant default.We maintain two separate financial safeguard packages: •a financial safeguard package for all futures, options and over-the-counter swap contracts other than cleared interest rate swap contracts (base package); and•a financial safeguard package for cleared interest rate swap contracts.In the unlikely event of a payment default by a clearing firm, we would first apply assets of the defaulting clearing firm to satisfy its payment obligation. These assets include the defaulting firm's guaranty fund contributions, performance bonds and any other available assets, such as assets required for clearing membership and any associated trading rights. In addition, we would make a demand for payment pursuant to any applicable guarantee provided to us by the parent company of the clearing firm. Thereafter, if the payment default remains unsatisfied, we would use our corporate contributions designated for the respective financial safeguard package. We would then use guaranty fund contributions of other clearing firms within the respective financial safeguard package and funds collected through an assessment against solvent clearing firms within the respective financial safeguard package to satisfy the deficit.We maintain a $7.0 billion 364-day multi-currency line of credit with a consortium of domestic and international banks to be used in certain situations by our clearing house. We have the option to request an increase in the line from $7.0 billion to $10.0 billion. We may use the proceeds to provide temporary liquidity in the unlikely event of a clearing firm default, in the event of a liquidity constraint or default by a depositary (custodian of the collateral) or in the event of a temporary disruption with the payments systems that would delay payment of settlement variation between us and our clearing firms. The credit agreement requires us to pledge certain assets to the line of credit custodian prior to drawing on the line of credit. Pledged assets may include clearing firm guaranty fund deposits held by us in the form of cash or U.S. Treasury securities. Performance bond collateral of a defaulting clearing firm may also be used to secure a draw on the line. In addition to the 364-day multi-currency line of credit, we also have the option to use our $2.3 billion multi-currency revolving senior credit facility to provide liquidity for our clearing house in the unlikely event of default. 46Table of ContentsAt December 31, 2021, aggregate performance bond deposits for clearing firms for both financial safeguard packages was $224.8 billion, including cash performance bond deposits, non-cash deposits, Interest Earnings Facility funds and letters of credit. A defaulting firm's performance bond deposits can be used in the event of default of that clearing firm. The following shows the available assets at December 31, 2021 in the event of a payment default by a clearing firm for the base financial safeguard package after first utilizing the defaulting firm's available assets: (in millions)Clearing HouseAvailable AssetsDesignated corporate contributions for futures and options(1)$100.0 Guaranty fund contributions(2)5,902.9 Assessment powers(3)16,233.0 _______________(1)Our clearing house designates $100.0 million of corporate contributions to satisfy a clearing firm default in the event that the defaulting clearing firm's guaranty contributions and performance bonds do not satisfy the deficit. (2)Guaranty fund contributions of clearing firms include guaranty fund contributions required of clearing firms, but do not include any excess deposits held by us at the direction of clearing firms. (3)In the event of a clearing firm default, if a loss continues to exist after the utilization of the assets of the defaulted firm, our corporate contribution and the non-defaulting clearing firms' guaranty fund contributions, we would assess all non-defaulting clearing members as provided in the rules governing the guaranty fund. We could assess non-defaulting clearing members 275% of their existing guaranty fund requirements up to a maximum of 550% of their existing guaranty fund requirements as provided in the rules. Assessment powers are calculated to reflect the potential obligation that each clearing member could be called for in the event clearing member defaults exhaust the guaranty fund; however, the total amount available would be reduced by the defaulted clearing members' assessment obligations since they would no longer be able to satisfy their obligations.The following shows the available assets for the interest rate swap financial safeguard package at December 31, 2021 in the event of a payment default by a clearing firm that clears interest rate swap contracts, after first utilizing the defaulting firm's available assets: (in millions)Clearing HouseAvailable AssetsDesignated corporate contributions for interest rate swap contracts(1)$150.0 Guaranty fund contributions(2)3,798.4 Assessment powers(3)1,336.0 _______________(1)Our clearing house designates $150.0 million of corporate contributions to satisfy a clearing firm default in the event that the defaulting clearing firm's guaranty contributions and performance bonds do not satisfy the deficit.

(3)In the event of a clearing firm default, if a loss continues to exist after the utilization of the assets of the defaulted firm, our corporate contribution and the non-defaulting firms' guaranty fund contributions, we would assess non-defaulting clearing members as provided in the rules governing the interest rate swap guaranty fund. Assessment powers are calculated to reflect the potential obligation that each clearing member could be called for based on potential failure of the third and fourth largest clearing.BrokerTec Americas Matched Principal BusinessBrokerTec Americas maintains a matched principal business, where it serves as a fully matched counterparty to offsetting positions entered into by clients on its electronic trading platform to facilitate anonymity and access to clearing and settlement. BrokerTec Americas uses Fixed Income Clearing Corporation (FICC), a third-party central clearing house as well as a third-party clearing bank for the settlement of transactions and is required to post short-term margin requirements twice a day that can vary based on the size of unsettled transactions and any adverse market changes. At December 31, 2021, the balance of the collateral at FICC was $100.0 million, which was included in other current assets on the consolidated balance sheet. Without sufficient funds to meet its obligations, BrokerTec Americas could be exposed to risk of breach of contract with the counterparties and the inability to continue as a member of the third-party central clearing house. Transactions with clearing house members are typically confirmed and novated shortly after execution, at which point the clearing house assumes the risk of settlement. For transactions with counterparties that are not members of the third-party clearing house, settlement typically occurs on the day following execution and, prior to settlement, BrokerTec Americas is exposed to the risk of loss in the event a counterparty fails to meet its obligations. If that were to occur, BrokerTec Americas would have the right to cover or liquidate the open position but could incur a loss as a result of market movements.47Table of ContentsForeign Currency Exchange Rate RiskForeign Currency Transaction Risk We have foreign currency transaction risk related to changes in exchange rates on monetary assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses held at subsidiaries where those balances and activity are denominated in a currency other than the subsidiary's functional currency. Gains and losses on foreign currency transactions result primarily from cash, debt and other monetary assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses denominated in British pounds, euros and Japanese yen. Aggregate transaction gains (losses) for 2021, 2020 and 2019 were $0.4 million, $(9.3) million and $(7.2) million, respectively. We expect the foreign currency gain/loss to continue to fluctuate as long as we continue to hold monetary assets and liabilities at those subsidiaries. Market uncertainty could potentially lead to significant volatility with foreign currency exchange rates, which could result in additional foreign currency gain/loss. Foreign Currency Translation Risk We have foreign currency translation risk related to the translation of our foreign subsidiaries' assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses from their respective functional currencies to the U.S. dollar at each reporting date. Fluctuations in exchange rates may impact the amount of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses we report on our consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of income. The financial statements of those foreign subsidiaries with functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars using a current exchange rate. Gains and losses resulting from this translation are recognized as a foreign currency translation adjustment within accumulated other comprehensive income, which is a component of shareholders' equity and comprehensive income. Aggregate translation gains (losses), net of tax, for 2021, 2020 and 2019 were $(62.0) million, $134.3 million and $(0.6) million, respectively. Foreign Currency Exchange Risk Related to Customer CollateralA portion of performance bond deposits is denominated in various foreign currencies. We mark-to-market all deposits daily and require payment from clearing firms whose collateral has lost value due to changes in foreign currency rates and price. Therefore, our exposure to foreign currency risk related to performance bond deposits is considered minimal and is not expected to be material to our financial condition or operating results.48Table of Contents",2023-12-30 20:16:11.339729

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSINTRODUCTIONManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is organized as follows:•Executive Summary: Includes an overview of our business; current economic, competitive and regulatory trends relevant to our business; our current business strategy; and our primary sources of operating and non-operating revenues and expenses.•Critical Accounting Policies: Provides an explanation of accounting policies that may have a significant impact on our financial results and the estimates, assumptions and risks associated with those policies.•Results of Operations: Includes an analysis of our 2022 financial results and a discussion of any known events or trends that are likely to impact future results.•Liquidity and Capital Resources: Includes a discussion of our future cash requirements, capital resources, significant planned expenditures and financing arrangements.References in this discussion and analysis to ""we"" and ""our"" are to CME Group Inc. (CME Group) and its consolidated subsidiaries, collectively. References to ""exchange"" are to Chicago Mercantile Exchange Inc. (CME), the Board of Trade of the City of Chicago, Inc. (CBOT), New York Mercantile Exchange, Inc. (NYMEX) and Commodity Exchange, Inc. (COMEX), collectively, unless otherwise noted. EXECUTIVE SUMMARYBusiness OverviewCME Group, a Delaware stock corporation, is the holding company for CME, CBOT, NYMEX, COMEX, NEX and their respective subsidiaries. The holding company structure is designed to provide strategic and operational flexibility. CME Group's Class A common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market (Nasdaq) under the ticker symbol ""CME."" Our exchange consists of designated contract markets for the trading of futures and options contracts. We also clear futures, options and swaps contracts through our clearing house. Futures contracts, options contracts and swaps contracts provide investors with vehicles for protecting against, and potentially profiting from, price changes in financial instruments and physical commodities. We are a global company with customer access available virtually all over the world. Our customers consist of professional traders, financial institutions, individual and institutional investors, major corporations, manufacturers, producers, governments and central banks. Customers include both members of the exchange and non-members. We offer our customers the opportunity to trade futures contracts and options contracts on a range of products, including those based on interest rates, equity indexes, foreign exchange, agricultural commodities, energy and metals. Through our cash markets business, we offer fixed income trading through BrokerTec and foreign currency trading through EBS. Our products provide a means for hedging, speculating and allocating assets. We identify new products by monitoring economic trends and their impact on the risk management and speculative needs of our existing and prospective customers. Most of our products are available for trading through our electronic trading platforms. These execution facilities offer our customers immediate trade execution and price transparency. In addition, trades can be executed through privately negotiated transactions that are cleared and settled through our clearing house. Prior to September 2021, we provided optimization services that delivered transaction lifecycle management and information services to help our customers optimize their capital, mitigate their risk and reduce operational costs. Optimization services included Traiana, TriOptima and Reset. In September 2021, we contributed the net assets of our optimization business to OSTTRA, our joint venture with IHS Markit (later acquired by S&P Global).Our clearing house clears, settles and guarantees futures and options contracts traded through our exchanges, in addition to cleared swaps products. Our clearing house's performance guarantee is an important function of our business. Because of this guarantee, our customers do not need to evaluate the credit of each potential counterparty or limit themselves to a selected set of counterparties. This flexibility increases the potential liquidity available for each trade. Additionally, the substitution of our clearing house as the counterparty to every transaction allows our customers to establish a position with one party and offset the position with another party. This contract offsetting process provides our customers with flexibility in establishing and adjusting positions and provides for collateral and margining efficiencies. Certain BrokerTec contracts are cleared at third-party clearing houses. 30Table of ContentsBusiness TrendsEconomic Environment. Our customers continue to use our markets as an effective and transparent means to manage risk and meet their investment needs. Trading activity in our centralized markets has fluctuated due to the ongoing uncertainty in the financial markets, fluctuations in the availability of credit, variations in the amount of assets under management as well as the Federal Reserve Bank’s interest rate policy and quantitative easing. We continue to maintain high quality and diverse products as well as various clearing and market data services, which support our customers in any economic environment. Competitive Environment. Our industry is competitive and we continue to encounter competition in all aspects of our business. We expect competition to continue to intensify, especially in light of ongoing regulatory reform in the financial services industry. Competition is influenced by our brand and reputation; the efficiency and security of our settlement, clearing and support services; depth and liquidity of our markets; diversity of product offerings, including frequency and quality of new product development and innovative services; our ability to position and expand upon existing products to address changing market needs; efficient and seamless customer experience; transparency, reliability, anonymity and security of transaction processing; the regulatory environment; connectivity, accessibility, flexibility in execution methods and distribution; and technology capability and innovation, as well as overall transaction costs. We believe we are very well positioned with respect to these factors. Our asset classes contain products designed to address differing risk management needs, and customers are able to achieve operational and capital efficiencies by accessing our diverse products through our platforms and our clearing house. We compete in a large and expanding financial services trading, clearing and settlement marketplace globally. As markets continue to evolve, we will continue to adapt our trading technology and clearing services to meet the needs of our customers. The competitive environment to which we are subject is discussed in ""Item 1 - Business"" beginning on page 10.Regulatory Environment. Our exchange-traded derivatives exchanges and other businesses are regulated and we serve a customer base that includes regulated institutions and individuals. Developments in the regulatory environment have the potential to significantly impact our business. Compliance with regulations may require us and our customers to dedicate significant financial and operational resources, which could adversely affect our profitability. The regulatory environment to which we are subject is discussed in ""Item 1 - Business"" beginning on page 11.Business StrategyOur strategy focuses on maximizing futures and options growth globally, diversifying our business and revenues and delivering unparalleled customer efficiencies and operational excellence, including through our partnership with Google Cloud. This strategy allows us to continue to develop into a more broadly diversified financial exchange that provides trading and clearing solutions across a wide range of products and asset classes. Our strategic initiatives are discussed in ""Item 1 - Business"" beginning on page 7. RevenuesClearing and transaction fees. A majority of our revenue is derived from clearing and transaction fees, which include electronic trading fees, surcharges for privately negotiated transactions and other volume-related charges for exchange-traded and over-the-counter (OTC) contracts. Because clearing and transaction fees are assessed on a per-contract or notional value basis, revenues and profitability fluctuate with changes in contract volume. In addition to the business trends noted earlier, our contract volume, and consequently our revenues, tend to increase during periods of economic and geopolitical uncertainty as our customers seek to manage their exposure to, or speculate on, the market volatility resulting from that uncertainty. While volume has the most significant impact on our clearing and transaction fees revenue, there are four other factors that also influence this source of revenue: •rate structure;•product mix;•venue; and•the percentage of trades executed by customers who are members compared with non-member customers.Rate structure. Customers benefit from volume discounts and limits on fees as part of our effort to increase liquidity in certain products. We offer various incentive programs to promote trading and clearing in various products and geographic locations. We may periodically change fees, volume discounts, fee limits and member discounts, perhaps significantly, based on our review of operations and the business environment. Product mix. We offer exchange-traded futures and options contracts as well as cleared-only interest rate swap contracts. We also offer foreign exchange spot and forward contracts and fixed income products. Rates are varied by product in order to optimize revenue on existing products and to encourage contract volume upon introduction of new products. Venue. Our exchange and platforms are an international marketplace that brings together buyers and sellers mainly through our electronic trading as well as through open outcry trading and privately negotiated transactions. Any customer who is guaranteed by a clearing firm and who agrees to be bound by our exchange rules is able to obtain direct access to our 31Table of Contentselectronic platforms. Open outcry trading is conducted exclusively by our members, who may execute trades on behalf of customers or for themselves. Beginning in May 2021, open outcry trading is now limited to Eurodollar options and Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) options products following the permanent closure of most of our open outcry pits. Typically, customers submitting trades through our electronic platforms are charged fees for using the platforms in addition to the fees assessed on all transactions executed on our exchange. Customers entering into privately negotiated transactions also incur additional charges beyond the fees assessed on other transactions. Member/non-member mix. Generally, member customers are charged lower fees than our non-member customers. Holding all other factors constant, revenue decreases if the percentage of trades executed by members increases, and increases if the percentage of non-member trades increases. Clearing and transaction fees for cash markets business. Our cash markets business provides matching services whereby we match a buyer and seller of financial instruments to allow both parties to complete the trade bilaterally or through a third-party clearing house. We are not involved in the settlement of the contract but charge a transaction fee generally based on volume or notional value of the trade for providing the matching service. BrokerTec Americas also generates revenue from a matched principal business. This business serves as a fully matched counterparty to offsetting positions entered into by clients on our electronic trading platform to facilitate anonymity and access to clearing and settlement. Revenue is generated from this business generally on a transaction fee basis. Other sources. Revenue is also derived from other sources, including market data and information services and other various services related to our exchange operations. Market data and information services. We receive market data and information services revenue from the dissemination of our market data to subscribers. Subscribers can obtain access to our market data services either directly or through third-party distributors. Our service offerings include access to real-time, delayed and end-of-day quotations, trade and summary market data for our products and other data sources. Users of our basic service receive real-time quotes and pay a flat monthly fee for each screen, or device, displaying our market data. Alternatively, customers can subscribe to market data provided on a limited group of products. The fee for this service is also a flat rate per month.Pricing for our market data services is based on the value of the service provided and the price of comparable services offered by our competitors. Increases or decreases in our market data and information services revenue are influenced by changes in our price structure and incentive programs for existing market data offerings, introduction of new market data services and changes in the number of devices in use. General economic factors that affect the financial services industry, which constitutes our primary customer base, also influence revenue from our market data services. Other revenues. Other revenue includes access and communication fees. Access and communication fees are connectivity fees charged to members and clearing firms that utilize our various telecommunications networks and communications services. Our communication services include our co-location program as well as the connectivity charges to customers of the CME Globex platform. Access fee revenue varies depending on the type of connection provided to customers. Prior to the contribution of the net assets of our optimization business to OSTTRA, other revenues included revenues from our optimization services, which included fees for risk management and information services for the OTC markets, including portfolio reconciliation and post-trade processing. Revenue earned from these services was typically generated through subscriptions or transaction fees. Other revenues also include fees for collateral management, equity subscription fees and fees for trade order routing through agreements from various strategic relationships as well as other services to members and clearing firms.ExpensesThe majority of our expenses do not vary directly with changes in our contract volume. However, licensing and other fee agreements can vary directly with certain equity, energy and swap volumes, and the majority of our employee bonuses vary indirectly with overall contract volume, as bonuses are primarily based on our financial performance. Compensation and benefits. Compensation and benefits expense is our most significant expense and includes employee wages, bonuses, stock-based compensation, benefits and employer taxes. Changes in this expense are driven by fluctuations in the number of employees, increases in wages as a result of labor market conditions, changes in rates for employer taxes and other cost increases affecting benefit plans. In addition, this expense is affected by the composition of our workforce. The expense associated with our bonus and stock-based compensation plans can also have a significant impact on this expense category. 32Table of ContentsThe bonus component of our compensation and benefits expense is based on our financial performance. Under the performance criteria of our annual incentive plans, the bonus funded under the plans is based on achieving certain financial performance targets established by the compensation committee of our board of directors. The compensation committee has discretion to make equitable adjustments to the cash earnings performance calculation to reflect effects of unplanned operating results or capital expenditures to meet intermediate- to long-term growth opportunities. In general, stock-based compensation is a non-cash expense related to restricted stock and performance share grants. Stock-based compensation varies depending on the quantity and fair value of awards granted. The fair value of restricted stock awards and other performance share grants is based on either the share price on the date of the grant or a model of expected future stock prices. Professional fees and outside services. This expense includes fees for consulting services received on strategic and technology initiatives; regulatory and other compliance matters; temporary labor as well as legal and accounting fees. This expense may fluctuate as a result of changes in services required to complete initiatives, handle legal proceedings and comply with regulatory and compliance requirements.Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense results from the depreciation of long-lived assets such as buildings, leasehold improvements, furniture, fixtures and equipment. This expense also includes the amortization of purchased and internally developed software. Amortization of purchased intangibles. Amortization of purchased intangibles includes amortization of intangible assets obtained in our acquisitions of CBOT Holdings, Inc., NYMEX Holdings, Inc. and NEX as well as other asset and business acquisitions. Intangible assets subject to amortization consist primarily of clearing firm, market data and other customer relationships. Other expenses. We incur additional ongoing expenses for communications, technology support services and various other activities necessary to support our operations. •Technology expense consists of costs related to maintenance of the hardware and software required to support our technology. It also includes costs for network connections for our electronic platforms and some market data customers; telecommunications costs of our exchange, and fees paid for access to external market data. This expense may be driven by system capacity, cloud consumption, functionality and redundancy requirements. It also may be impacted by growth in electronic contract volume and changes in the number of telecommunications hubs and connections which allow customers outside the U.S. to access our electronic platforms directly. •Licensing and other fee agreements expense includes license fees paid as a result of contract volume in equity index products. This expense also includes royalty fees and broker rebates on energy and metals products, as well as revenue sharing on cleared swaps contracts and some new product launches. This expense fluctuates with changes in contract volumes as well as changes in fee structures. •Other expenses include occupancy and building operations expenses including rent, maintenance, real estate taxes, utilities and other related costs related to leased property in Chicago, New York, the U.K., and India, as well as other smaller locations throughout the world. Other expenses also include marketing and travel-related expenses as well as general and administrative costs. Marketing, advertising and public relations expense includes media, print and other advertising costs, as well as costs associated with our product promotion. Other expenses also include litigation and customer settlements, impairment charges on operating assets, gains and losses on disposals of certain operating assets, and foreign currency transaction gains and losses resulting from changes in exchange rates on certain foreign monetary assets and liabilities.Non-Operating Income and ExpensesIncome and expenses incurred through activities outside of our core operations are considered non-operating. These activities include non-core investing and financing activities. •Investment income includes income from short-term investment of clearing firms' cash performance bonds and guaranty fund contributions as well as excess operating cash; interest income and realized gains and losses from our marketable securities; realized gains and losses and dividend income from our strategic equity investments, and gains and losses on trading securities in our non-qualified deferred compensation plans. Investment income is influenced by market interest rates, changes in the levels of cash performance bonds deposited by clearing firms, the amount of dividends distributed by our strategic investments and the availability of funds generated by operations. •Interest and other borrowing costs expense includes charges associated with various short-term and long-term funding facilities, including commitment fees on lines of credit agreements.33Table of Contents•Equity in net earnings (losses) of unconsolidated subsidiaries includes income and losses from our investments in S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC, OSTTRA, Shanghai CFETS-NEX International Money Broking Co., Ltd. and Dubai Mercantile Exchange.•Other income (expense) includes expenses related to the distribution of a portion of interest earned on performance bond collateral reinvestment to the clearing firms, gains and losses on derivative contracts and other various income and expenses outside our core operations.CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIESThe notes to our consolidated financial statements include disclosure of our significant accounting policies. In establishing these policies within the framework of accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., management must make certain assessments, estimates and choices that will result in the application of these principles in a manner that appropriately reflects our financial condition and results of operations. Critical accounting policies are those policies that we believe present the most complex or subjective measurements and have the most potential to affect our financial position and operating results. While all decisions regarding accounting policies are important, there are certain accounting policies that we consider to be critical. These critical policies, which are presented in detail in the notes to our consolidated financial statements, relate to the valuation of financial instruments, goodwill and intangible assets, revenue recognition, income taxes and internal use software costs. Valuation of financial instruments. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, or an exit price. We have categorized financial instruments measured at fair value into the following three-level fair value hierarchy based upon the level of judgment associated with the inputs used to measure the fair value: •Level 1 inputs, which are considered the most reliable evidence of fair value, consist of quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets. •Level 2 inputs consist of observable market data, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, or inputs other than quoted prices that are directly observable. •Level 3 inputs consist of unobservable inputs, which are derived and cannot be corroborated by market data or other entity-specific inputs.For further discussion regarding the fair value of financial assets and liabilities, see note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and note 17. Fair Value Measurements to the consolidated financial statements. Goodwill and intangible assets. We review goodwill for impairment on a quarterly basis and whenever events or circumstances indicate that its carrying value may not be recoverable. Goodwill may be tested quantitatively for impairment by comparing the carrying value of a reporting unit to its estimated fair value. Estimating the fair value of a reporting unit involves the use of valuation techniques that rely on significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions may include forecasted revenue growth rates; forecasted operating margins; risk-adjusted discount rates; forecasted economic and market conditions; and industry multiples. We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable given the information that is available to us at the time of our assessment; however, actual future results may differ significantly from those estimates. Under certain favorable circumstances, goodwill may be reviewed qualitatively for indications of impairment without utilizing valuation techniques to estimate fair value. The qualitative assessment of goodwill may rely on significant assumptions about forecasts of revenue growth, operating margins and economic conditions as well as overall market and industry-specific trends. In addition, the carrying value of goodwill, as denominated in foreign currencies, is adjusted each reporting period as a result of movements in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar. Such foreign currency translation adjustments are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within shareholders' equity.We also review indefinite-lived intangible assets on a quarterly basis or more frequently when events and circumstances indicate that their carrying values may not be recoverable. Indefinite-lived intangible assets may be tested quantitatively for impairment by comparing their carrying values to their estimated fair values. Estimating the fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets involves the use of valuation techniques that rely on significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions may include forecasted revenue growth rates, forecasted allocations of expense and risk-adjusted discount rates. We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable given the information that is available to us at the time of our assessment; however, actual future results may differ significantly from those estimates. Similar to goodwill, under certain favorable circumstances, indefinite-lived intangible assets may be reviewed qualitatively for indications of impairment without utilizing valuation techniques to estimate fair value. The qualitative assessment of indefinite-lived intangible assets may rely on significant assumptions about forecasts of revenue growth, operating margins and economic conditions as well as overall market and industry-specific trends.Intangible assets subject to amortization are also assessed for impairment on a quarterly basis or more frequently when indicated by a change in economic or operational circumstances. The impairment assessment of these assets requires management to first compare the carrying value of the amortizing asset to its undiscounted net cash flows. If the carrying value 34Table of Contentsexceeds the undiscounted net cash flows, management is then required to estimate the fair value of the assets and record an impairment loss for the excess of the carrying value over the fair value. In connection with this impairment assessment, management also challenges the useful lives of our definite-lived intangible assets. Revenue recognition. A significant portion of our revenue is derived from the clearing and transaction fees we assess on each contract executed through our trading venues and cleared through our clearing house. Clearing and transaction fees are recognized as revenue when a buy and sell order are matched, novated and when the trade is cleared. On occasion, the customer's exchange trading privileges may not be properly entered by the clearing firm and incorrect fees are charged for the transactions in the affected accounts. When this information is corrected within the time period allowed by the exchange, a fee adjustment is provided to the clearing firm. A reserve is established for estimated fee adjustments to reflect corrections to customer exchange trading privileges. This reserve has historically been immaterial. The reserve is based on the historical pattern of adjustments processed as well as management's estimate of future adjustment activity.Income taxes. Calculation of the income tax provision includes an estimate of the income taxes that will be paid for the current year, as well as an estimate of income tax liabilities or benefits deferred into future years. Deferred tax assets are reviewed to determine if they will be realized in future periods. To the extent it is determined that some deferred tax assets may not be fully realized, the assets are reduced to their realizable value by a valuation allowance. The calculation of our tax provision involves uncertainty in the application of complex tax regulations and we occasionally may consult with relevant tax authorities or engage third-party expertise where appropriate. We recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the United States and other applicable foreign tax jurisdictions using a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold based on the technical merits of the tax position taken or expected to be taken. If the actual obligation of these amounts varies from our estimate, our income tax provision would be reduced or increased at the time that determination is made. This determination may not be known for several years. Past tax audits have not resulted in tax adjustments that resulted in a material change to the income tax provision in the year the audit was completed. The effective tax rate, defined as the income tax provision as a percentage of income before income taxes, will vary from year to year based on changes in tax jurisdictions, tax rates and regulations. In addition, the effective tax rate will vary with changes to income that are not subject to income tax and changes in expenses or losses that are not deductible, such as the utilization of foreign net operating losses. Internal use software costs. Certain internal and external costs that are incurred in connection with developing or obtaining software for internal use are capitalized. We also enter into software hosting arrangements for software projects maintained or developed in the cloud. Software development costs incurred during the planning or maintenance stages of a software project are expensed as incurred, while certain costs incurred during the application development stage are capitalized and are amortized over the estimated useful life of the software, which is generally two to four years, but up to eight years for certain trading and clearing applications, depending upon expected useful lives. Amortization of capitalized costs begins only when the software becomes ready for its intended use. In addition, software assets are assessed for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying values may not be recoverable or that a reduction in the estimated useful lives is warranted.RESULTS OF OPERATIONSFinancial HighlightsThe following summarizes significant changes in our financial performance for the years presented. For a comparison of our results of operations for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2021 to December 31, 2020, see ""Part II, Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations"" of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, filed with the SEC on February 25, 2022.

Total contract volume includes contracts that are traded on our exchange and cleared through our clearing house and certain cleared-only contracts. Volume is measured in round turns, which is considered a completed transaction that involves a purchase and an offsetting sale of a contract. Average rate per contract is determined by dividing total clearing and transaction fees by total contract volume. Contract volume and average rate per contract disclosures below exclude trading volume for the cash markets business as well as interest rate swaps.

Due to the relationship between average rate per contract and contract volume, the change in clearing and transaction fees attributable to changes in each is only an approximation.36Table of ContentsContract VolumeThe following table summarizes average daily contract volume. Contract volume can be influenced by many factors, including political and economic factors, the regulatory environment and market competition.

The Federal Open Market Committee raised the Federal Funds rate by a total of 425 percentage points in 2022 and has indicated that it intends to further raise interest rates in the near future. The Federal Reserve also began quantitative tightening in the second half of 2022 by reducing its holdings of U.S. Treasury securities. However, the geopolitical uncertainty between Russia and Ukraine led to risk aversion and reduced trading by market participants within the agricultural commodity and energy markets due to global commodity trade uncertainty. We believe these factors led to the changes in contract volume during 2022, when compared with 2021.Interest Rate ProductsThe following table summarizes average daily contract volume for our key interest rate products.

We believe this was due to higher than expected inflation levels, the Federal Open Market Committee's decision to increase the Federal Funds rate multiple times in 2022 as well as the Federal Reserve's quantitative tightening in the second half of 2022. The increase in overall SOFR volume was also due to more market participants transitioning to the new reference rate away from LIBOR as well as incentive programs designed to encourage market participation in SOFR options trading.Equity Index ProductsThe following table summarizes average daily contract volume for our key equity index products.

Volatility within the equity indexes increased as a result of higher than expected inflation levels as well as the Federal Reserve's actions to increase the Federal Funds rate and quantitative tightening in 2022. We believe these factors led to the overall increases in equity contract volumes. Foreign Exchange ProductsThe following table summarizes average daily contract volume for our key foreign exchange products.

Participant trading activity slowed down largely due to concerns regarding high inflation and an economic downturn. In addition, the sustained conflict between Russia and Ukraine continued to cause disruptions to the global energy markets. We believe these factors led to the overall decrease in energy contract volume.Metal ProductsThe following table summarizes average daily volume for our key metal products.Year-over-Year Change(amounts in thousands)202220212022-2021Gold318330(4)%Copper93101(8)Silver8395(12)In 2022 when compared with 2021, overall metal contract volume decreased, which we believe was attributable to lower overall market volatility within the gold and silver markets. Volume was higher in 2021, as investors were using gold and other precious metals as safe-haven investments following the COVID-19 pandemic. Average Rate per ContractThe average rate per contract was lower in 2022 when compared with 2021. The decrease in the average rate per contract was primarily due to a change in product mix. Equity index contract volume increased by 5 percentage points as a percent of total volume, while agricultural commodity, energy and metal contract volume collectively decreased by 5 percentage points. In general, equity index products have a lower rate per contract compared with the agricultural commodity, energy and metal contracts. Cash Markets BusinessTotal clearing and transaction fees revenue in 2022 included $318.8 million of transaction fees attributable to the cash markets business, compared with $396.2 million in 2021. This revenue primarily includes BrokerTecs's fixed income volume and EBS foreign exchange volume. In September 2021, we contributed the net assets of our optimization business to OSTTRA, our joint venture with IHS Markit.Year-over-Year Change(amounts in millions)202220212022-2021BrokerTec fixed income transaction fees$164.7 $172.0 (4)%EBS foreign exchange transaction fees154.1 164.3 (6)%Optimization transaction fees— 59.9 n.m._________n.m. not meaningful39Table of ContentsThe related average daily notional value for the years ended 2022 and 2021 for key cash markets products were as follows:Year-over-Year Change(amounts in billions)202220212022-2021European Repo (in euros)$345.2 $292.3 18 %U.S. Treasury 126.1 115.0 10 %Spot FX65.7 61.2 7 %Overall average daily notional value for the cash markets business increased in 2022 when compared with 2021. The increases in European Repo and U.S. Treasury transactions were largely due to increased volatility as a result of a change in market expectations regarding the Federal Reserve's interest rate policy, following higher than expected inflation levels in 2022. Despite the increase in average daily notional value, transaction revenue for BrokerTec and EBS decreased slightly due to the tiered pricing structure and incentive rate programs. Concentration of RevenueWe bill a significant portion of our clearing and transaction fees to our clearing firms. The majority of clearing and transaction fees received from clearing firms represent charges for trades executed and cleared on behalf of their customers. One clearing firm represented at least approximately 10% of our clearing and transaction fees in 2022. Should a clearing firm withdraw, we believe that the customer portion of the firm's trading activity would likely transfer to another clearing firm of the exchange. Therefore, we do not believe we are exposed to significant risk from an ongoing loss of revenue received from or through a particular clearing firm. Other Sources of RevenueMarket data and information services. In 2022 when compared with 2021, the increase in market data and information services revenue was largely attributable to price increases for certain products as well as an increase in usage for certain products.The two largest resellers of our market data represented, in aggregate, approximately 33% of our market data and information services revenue in 2022. Despite this concentration, we consider exposure to significant risk of revenue loss to be minimal. In the event that one of these vendors no longer distributes our market data, we believe the majority of that vendor's customers would likely subscribe to our market data through another reseller. Additionally, several of our largest institutional customers that utilize services from our two largest resellers report usage and remit payment of their fees directly to us.Other revenues. In 2022 when compared with 2021, the decrease in other revenue was largely attributable to the deconsolidation of the optimization business in September 2021 as part of the contribution of the business's net assets to OSTTRA, our joint venture with IHS Markit. In 2021, the optimization business generated $115.1 million in other revenue.Expenses Year-over-Year Change(dollars in millions)202220212022-2021Compensation and benefits$753.1 $837.0 (10)%Technology188.6 192.6 (2)Professional fees and outside services137.4 151.7 (9)Amortization of purchased intangibles227.7 237.6 (4)Depreciation and amortization134.9 147.8 (9)Licensing and other fee agreements320.0 236.9 35 Other241.8 240.9 — Total Expenses$2,003.5 $2,044.5 (2)2022 Compared With 2021Operating expenses decreased by $41.0 million in 2022 when compared with 2021.

The decrease in professional fees was partially offset by an increase in consulting fees attributable to CME Group's partnership with Google Cloud, which was signed in November 2021.•In 2022, we recognized a net gain of $13.2 million, compared to a net gain of $0.4 million in 2021, due to currency exchange rate fluctuations. Gains and losses from exchange rate fluctuations are recognized in the consolidated statements of net income when subsidiaries with a U.S. dollar functional currency hold certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies.Increases in operating expenses in 2022 when compared with 2021 were as follows:•Bonus expense increased in 2022 largely due to performance relative to our 2022 cash earnings target when compared with 2021 performance relative to our 2021 cash earnings target.•Licensing and other fee agreements expense increased in 2022 due to higher volumes for certain equity products during 2022 compared with 2021.Non-Operating Income (Expense) Year-over-Year Change(dollars in millions)202220212022-2021Investment income$2,198.4 $306.9 n.m.Interest and other borrowing costs(162.7)(166.9)(2)Equity in net earnings (losses) of unconsolidated subsidiaries301.1 245.8 22 Other income (expense)(1,862.4)342.6 n.m.Total Non-Operating$474.4 $728.4 (35)_________n.m. not meaningfulInvestment income. In 2022 when compared with 2021, there was an increase in earnings from reinvested cash performance bond and guaranty fund contributions due to a higher rate of interest earned in the cash accounts at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago following interest rate hikes in 2022. In 2022 and 2021, earnings from cash performance bond and guaranty fund contributions were $2,169.5 million and $173.9 million, respectively. The increase in income was partially offset by a decrease in net realized and unrealized gains on investments as well as a decrease in earnings on our deferred compensation plan, the impact of which does not affect net income because of an equal and offsetting change in compensation and benefits expense.41Table of ContentsEquity in net earnings (losses) of unconsolidated subsidiaries. Higher income generated from our S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC business venture contributed to an increase in equity in net earnings (losses) of unconsolidated subsidiaries in 2022 when compared with 2021. We also recognized our share of net earnings on our investment in OSTTRA, our joint venture with IHS Markit that was formed in September 2021.Other income (expense). In 2022 when compared with 2021, we recognized higher expenses related to the distribution of interest earned on performance bond collateral reinvestments to the clearing firms in conjunction with higher interest income earned on our reinvestment during the period due to a higher Federal Funds rate in 2022. In 2022 and 2021, expenses related to the distribution of interest earned on collateral reinvestments were $1,889.7 million and $119.6 million, respectively. In 2021, we also recognized a net gain of $400.7 million on the deconsolidation and contribution of our optimization business to OSTTRA.Income Tax ProvisionThe following table summarizes the effective tax rate for the periods presented: 20222021Year-over-Year Change2022-2021Year ended December 3122.9 %21.8 %1.1 %The effective tax rate increased in 2022 when compared with 2021. In 2021, we recognized a gain on the deconsolidation and contribution of our optimization business to OSTTRA, which was not taxable. The impact of the gain in 2021 was partially offset by an increase to the statutory rate in the United Kingdom in 2021. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESCash RequirementsWe have historically met our funding requirements with cash generated by our ongoing operations. However, we have used our commercial paper program from time to time to fund large short-term funding needs. While our cost structure is generally fixed in the short term, our sources of operating cash are largely dependent on contract trading volume levels. In addition to using our existing cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and cash generated from operations, we may continue to utilize our commercial paper program to meet our working capital needs, capital expenditures and other commitments. It is also possible that we may need to raise additional funds to finance our activities through future public debt offerings or by direct borrowings from financial institutions through our committed revolving credit facilities.Cash will also be required for non-cancellable purchase obligations as at December 31, 2022. Commitments include material contractual purchase obligations that are non-cancellable. Purchase obligations relate to advertising, licensing, hardware, software and maintenance as well as telecommunication services. Aside from the table below, we have certain other arrangements that have a perpetual term for which we pay a minimum of $5.0 million per year. At December 31, 2022, future minimum payments due under purchase obligations were payable as follows (in millions): Year 2023$92.6 2024-2025184.0 2026-2027215.1 Thereafter733.0 Total$1,224.7 Future capital expenditures for technology are anticipated as we continue to support our growth through increased system capacity, performance improvements, integration of acquired platforms and improvements to some of our office spaces. Each year, capital expenditures are incurred for improvements to and modification of our offices, remote data centers, telecommunications network and other operating equipment. In 2023, we expect capital expenditures to total approximately $100.0 million, net of any leasehold improvement allowances. We continue to monitor our capital needs and may revise our forecasted expenditures as necessary in the future. We intend to continue to pay a regular quarterly dividend to our shareholders, with a target of between 50% to 60% of the prior year's cash earnings. The decision to pay a dividend and the amount of the dividend, however, remains within the discretion of our board of directors and may be affected by various factors, including our earnings, financial condition, capital requirements, levels of indebtedness and other considerations our board of directors deems relevant. We are also required to comply with restrictions contained in the general corporation laws of our state of incorporation, which could limit our ability to declare and pay dividends. On February 2, 2023, the company declared a regular quarterly dividend of $1.10 per share for all outstanding 42Table of Contentscommon and preferred shares. The dividend will be payable on March 27, 2023 to shareholders of record on March 10, 2023. Assuming no changes in the number of shares outstanding, the first quarter dividend payment will total approximately $400.0 million. The board of directors also declared an additional, annual variable dividend of $4.50 per share on December 8, 2022 paid on January 18, 2023 to the shareholders of record on December 28, 2022. In general, the amount of the annual variable dividend will be determined by the end of each year, and the level will increase or decrease from year to year based on operating results, capital expenditures, potential merger and acquisition activity and other forms of capital return, including regular dividends and share buybacks during the prior year. Sources and Uses of CashThe following is a summary of cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities.

This was partially offset by income tax payments which were higher in 2022 compared with 2021. Investing activitiesThe increase in cash used in investing activities in 2022 compared with 2021 was largely due to the additional investment in S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC of $410.0 million. In addition, we received $100.7 million from the OSTTRA joint venture transaction and additional proceeds from sales of investments in 2021. Financing activitiesCash used in financing activities was higher in 2022 when compared with 2021 mainly due to a decrease in cash performance bonds and guaranty fund contributions. In addition, there was an increase in dividends paid in 2022. In 2021, we received proceeds of $965.0 million from the issuance of preferred shares in connection with our partnership with Google Cloud.

The proceeds from this facility can be used for general corporate purposes, which includes providing liquidity for our clearing house in certain circumstances at CME Group's discretion and, if necessary, for maturities of commercial paper. As long as we are not in default under this facility, we have the option to increase it up to $3.3 billion with the consent of the agent and lenders providing the additional funds. This facility is voluntarily pre-payable from time to time without premium or penalty. Under this facility, we are required to remain in compliance with a consolidated net worth test, which is defined as our consolidated shareholders' equity at September 30, 2021, giving effect to share repurchases made and special dividends paid 43Table of Contentsduring the term of the agreements (and in no event greater than $2.0 billion in aggregate), multiplied by 0.65. We currently do not have any borrowings outstanding under this facility, but any commercial paper balance if or when outstanding can be backstopped against this facility.We maintain a 364-day multi-currency revolving secured credit facility with a consortium of domestic and international banks to be used in certain situations by the clearing house. The facility provides for borrowings of up to $7.0 billion. We may use the proceeds to provide temporary liquidity in the unlikely event a clearing firm fails to promptly discharge an obligation to CME Clearing, in the event of a liquidity constraint or default by a depositary (custodian for our collateral), in the event of a temporary disruption with the domestic payments system that would delay payment of settlement variation between us and our clearing firms, or in other cases as provided by the CME rulebook. Clearing firm guaranty fund contributions received in the form of cash or U.S. Treasury securities as well as the performance bond assets (pursuant to the CME rulebook) can be used to collateralize the facility. At December 31, 2022, guaranty fund contributions available to collateralize the facility totaled $6.9 billion. We have the option to request an increase in the line from $7.0 billion to $10.0 billion. Our 364-day facility contains a requirement that CME remain in compliance with a consolidated tangible net worth test, defined as CME's consolidated shareholder's equity less intangible assets (as defined in the agreement), of not less than $800.0 million. We currently do not have any borrowings outstanding under this facility. The indentures governing our fixed rate notes, our $2.3 billion multi-currency revolving senior credit facility and our 364-day multi-currency revolving secured credit facility for $7.0 billion do not contain specific covenants that restrict the ability to pay dividends. These documents, however, do contain other customary financial and operating covenants that place restrictions on the operations of the company that could indirectly affect the ability to pay dividends. At December 31, 2022, we have excess borrowing capacity for general corporate purposes of approximately $2.3 billion under our multi-currency revolving senior credit facility.At December 31, 2022, we were in compliance with the various covenant requirements of all our debt facilities.CME Group, as a holding company, has no operations of its own. Instead, it relies on dividends declared and paid to it by its subsidiaries in order to provide the funds that it uses to pay dividends to its shareholders.To satisfy our performance bond obligation with Singapore Exchange Limited, we may pledge irrevocable standby letters of credit. At December 31, 2022, the letters of credit totaled $330.0 million. We also maintain a $350.0 million line of credit to meet our obligations under this agreement.The following table summarizes our credit ratings as of December 31, 2022: Rating AgencyShort-TermDebt RatingLong-TermDebt RatingOutlookStandard & Poor’sA1+AA-StableMoody’s Investors ServiceP1Aa3StableGiven our cash flow generation, our ability to pay down debt levels and our ability to refinance existing debt facilities, if necessary, we expect to maintain an investment grade rating. If our ratings are downgraded below investment grade within certain specified time periods due to a change of control, we are required to make an offer to repurchase our fixed rate notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest. No report of any rating agency is incorporated by reference herein.Liquidity and Cash ManagementCash and cash equivalents, excluding restricted cash, totaled $2.7 billion and $2.8 billion at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. The balance retained in cash and cash equivalents is a function of anticipated or possible short-term cash needs, prevailing interest rates, our corporate investment policy and alternative investment choices. A majority of our cash and cash equivalents balance is invested in money market mutual funds that invest only in U.S. Treasury securities, U.S. government agency securities and U.S. Treasury security reverse repurchase agreements and short-term bank deposits. Our exposure to credit and liquidity risk is minimal given the nature of the investments. Cash that is not available for general corporate purposes because of regulatory requirements or other restrictions is classified as restricted cash and is included in other current assets or other assets in the consolidated balance sheets.Our practice is to have our pension plan 100% funded at each year end on a projected benefit obligation basis, while also satisfying any minimum required contribution and obtaining the maximum tax deduction. Based on our actuarial projections, we estimate that no additional contribution will be necessary in 2023 to meet our funding goal. However, the amount of the actual contribution is contingent on various factors, including the actual rate of return on our plan assets during 2023 and the December 31, 2023 discount rate. 44Table of ContentsRegulatory Requirements CME is regulated by the CFTC as a Derivatives Clearing Organization (DCO). DCOs are required to maintain capital, as defined by the CFTC, in an amount at least equal to one year of projected operating expenses as well as cash, liquid securities, or a line of credit at least equal to six months of projected operating expenses. CME was designated by the Financial Stability Oversight Council as a systemically important financial market utility under Title VIII of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. As a result, CME must comply with CFTC regulations applicable to a systemically important DCO for financial resources and liquidity resources. CME is in compliance with all DCO financial requirements.CME, CBOT, NYMEX and COMEX are regulated by the CFTC as Designated Contract Markets (DCM). DCMs are required to maintain capital, as defined by the CFTC, in an amount at least equal to one year of projected operating expenses as well as cash, liquid securities or a line of credit at least equal to six months of projected operating expenses. Our DCMs are in compliance with all DCM financial requirements. BrokerTec Americas LLC is required to maintain sufficient net capital under Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act), Rule 15c3-1 (the Net Capital Rule). The Net Capital Rule focuses on liquidity and is designed to protect securities customers, counterparties, and creditors by requiring that broker-dealers have sufficient liquid resources on hand at all times to satisfy claims promptly. Rule 15c3-3, or the customer protection rule, which complements Rule 15c3-1, is designed to ensure that customer property (securities and funds) in the custody of broker-dealers is adequately safeguarded. By law, both of these rules apply to the activities of registered broker-dealers, but not to unregistered affiliates. The firm began operating as a (k)(2)(i) broker-dealer in November 2017 following notification to the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority and the SEC. A company operating under the (k)(2)(i) exemption is not required to lock up customer funds as would otherwise be required under Exchange Act Rule 15c3-3.ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKWe are subject to various market risks, including those caused by changes in interest rates, credit and foreign currency exchange rates.Interest Rate Risk Debt outstanding at December 31, 2022 consisted of fixed-rate borrowings of $3.4 billion (in U.S. dollar equivalent). Changes in interest rates impact the fair values of fixed-rate debt, but do not impact earnings or cash flows. We did not have any variable-rate borrowings at December 31, 2022. Credit Risk CME Clearing HouseOur clearing house acts as the counterparty to all trades consummated on our exchanges as well as through third-party exchanges and swaps markets for which we provide clearing services. As a result, we are exposed to significant credit risk of third parties, including clearing firms. We are also exposed, indirectly, to the credit risk of customers of our clearing firms. These parties may default on their obligations due to bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, operational failure or other reasons. In order to ensure performance, we establish and monitor financial requirements for our clearing firms. We set minimum performance bond requirements for exchange-traded and interest rate swaps products. For clearing firms, we establish performance bond requirements to cover at least 99% of expected price changes for a given product within a given historical period with further quantitative and qualitative considerations based on market risk. We establish haircuts applied to collateral deposited to meet performance bond requirements to cover at least 99% of expected price changes and foreign currency changes for a given asset within a given historical period with further quantitative and qualitative considerations. Haircuts vary depending on the type of collateral and maturity. We mark-to-market open positions of clearing firms at least once a day (twice a day for futures and options contracts) and require payment from clearing firms whose positions have lost value and make payments to clearing firms whose positions have gained value. We have the capability to mark-to-market more frequently as market conditions warrant. These practices allow our clearing house to quickly identify any clearing firms that may not be able to satisfy the financial obligations resulting from changes in the prices of their open positions before those financial obligations become exceptionally large and jeopardize the ability of our clearing house to ensure performance of their open positions. Although we have policies and procedures to help ensure that our clearing firms can satisfy their obligations, these policies and procedures may not succeed in detecting problems or preventing defaults. We also have in place various measures intended to enable us to cover any default and maintain liquidity. Despite our safeguards, we cannot guarantee that these measures will be sufficient to protect us from a default or that we will not be materially and adversely affected in the event of a significant default.45Table of ContentsWe maintain two separate financial safeguard packages: •a financial safeguard package for all futures, options and over-the-counter swap contracts other than cleared interest rate swap contracts (base package); and•a financial safeguard package for cleared interest rate swap contracts.In the unlikely event of a payment default by a clearing firm, we would first apply assets of the defaulting clearing firm to satisfy its payment obligation. These assets include the defaulting firm's guaranty fund contributions, performance bonds and any other available assets, such as assets required for clearing membership and any associated trading rights. Thereafter, if the payment default remains unsatisfied, we would use our corporate contributions designated for the respective financial safeguard package. We would then use guaranty fund contributions of other clearing firms within the respective financial safeguard package and funds collected through an assessment against non-defaulting clearing firms within the respective financial safeguard package to satisfy the deficit.We maintain a $7.0 billion 364-day multi-currency line of credit with a consortium of domestic and international banks to be used in certain situations by our clearing house. We have the option to request an increase in the line from $7.0 billion to $10.0 billion. We may use the proceeds to provide temporary liquidity in the unlikely event of a clearing firm default, in the event of a liquidity constraint or default by a depositary (custodian of the collateral) or in the event of a temporary disruption with the payments systems that would delay payment of settlement variation between us and our clearing firms. The credit agreement requires us to pledge certain assets to the line of credit custodian prior to drawing on the line of credit. Pledged assets may include clearing firm guaranty fund deposits held by us in the form of cash or U.S. Treasury securities. Performance bond collateral of a defaulting clearing firm may also be used to secure a draw on the line. In addition to the 364-day multi-currency line of credit, we also have the option to use our $2.3 billion multi-currency revolving senior credit facility to provide liquidity for our clearing house in the unlikely event of default. At December 31, 2022, aggregate performance bond deposits for clearing firms for both financial safeguard packages was $231.5 billion, including cash performance bond deposits, non-cash deposits, Interest Earnings Facility funds and letters of credit. A defaulting firm's performance bond deposits can be used in the event of default of that clearing firm. The following shows the available assets at December 31, 2022 in the event of a payment default by a clearing firm for the base financial safeguard package after first utilizing the defaulting firm's available assets: (in millions)Clearing HouseAvailable AssetsDesignated corporate contributions for futures and options(1)$100.0 Guaranty fund contributions(2)4,404.5 Assessment powers(3)12,112.2 _______________(1)Our clearing house designates $100.0 million of corporate contributions to satisfy a clearing firm default in the event that the defaulting clearing firm's guaranty contributions and performance bonds do not satisfy the deficit. (2)Guaranty fund contributions of clearing firms include guaranty fund contributions required of clearing firms, but do not include any excess deposits held by us at the direction of clearing firms. (3)In the event of a clearing firm default, if a loss continues to exist after the utilization of the assets of the defaulted firm, our corporate contribution and the non-defaulting clearing firms' guaranty fund contributions, we would assess all non-defaulting clearing members as provided in the rules governing the guaranty fund. We could assess non-defaulting clearing members 275% of their existing guaranty fund requirements up to a maximum of 550% of their existing guaranty fund requirements as provided in the rules. Assessment powers are calculated to reflect the potential obligation that each clearing member could be called for in the event clearing member defaults exhaust the guaranty fund; however, the total amount available would be reduced by the defaulted clearing members' assessment obligations since they would no longer be able to satisfy their obligations.46Table of ContentsThe following shows the available assets for the interest rate swap financial safeguard package at December 31, 2022 in the event of a payment default by a clearing firm that clears interest rate swap contracts, after first utilizing the defaulting firm's available assets: (in millions)Clearing HouseAvailable AssetsDesignated corporate contributions for interest rate swap contracts(1)$150.0 Guaranty fund contributions(2)2,508.2 Assessment powers(3)528.8 _______________(1)Our clearing house designates $150.0 million of corporate contributions to satisfy a clearing firm default in the event that the defaulting clearing firm's guaranty contributions and performance bonds do not satisfy the deficit.

(3)In the event of a clearing firm default, if a loss continues to exist after the utilization of the assets of the defaulted firm, our corporate contribution and the non-defaulting firms' guaranty fund contributions, we would assess non-defaulting clearing members as provided in the rules governing the interest rate swap guaranty fund. Assessment powers are calculated to reflect the potential obligation that each clearing member could be called for based on potential failure of the third and fourth largest clearing member; however, the total amount available would be reduced by the defaulted clearing members' assessment obligations since they would no longer be able to satisfy their obligations.BrokerTec Americas Matched Principal BusinessBrokerTec Americas maintains a matched principal business, where it serves as a fully matched counterparty to offsetting positions entered into by clients on its electronic trading platform to facilitate anonymity and access to clearing and settlement. BrokerTec Americas uses Fixed Income Clearing Corporation (FICC), a third-party central clearing house as well as a third-party clearing bank for the settlement of transactions and is required to post short-term margin requirements twice a day that can vary based on the size of unsettled transactions and any adverse market changes. At December 31, 2022, the balance of the collateral at FICC was $100.0 million, which was included in other current assets on the consolidated balance sheet. Without sufficient funds to meet its obligations, BrokerTec Americas could be exposed to risk of breach of contract with the counterparties and the inability to continue as a member of the third-party central clearing house. Transactions with clearing house members are typically confirmed and novated shortly after execution, at which point the clearing house assumes the risk of settlement. For transactions with counterparties that are not members of the third-party clearing house, settlement typically occurs on the day following execution and, prior to settlement, BrokerTec Americas is exposed to the risk of loss in the event a counterparty fails to meet its obligations. If that were to occur, BrokerTec Americas would have the right to cover or liquidate the open position but could incur a loss as a result of market movements.Foreign Currency Exchange Rate RiskForeign Currency Transaction Risk We have foreign currency transaction risk related to changes in exchange rates on monetary assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses held at subsidiaries where those balances and activity are denominated in a currency other than the subsidiary's functional currency. Gains and losses on foreign currency transactions result primarily from cash, debt and other monetary assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses denominated in British pounds, euros and Japanese yen. Aggregate transaction gains (losses) for 2022, 2021 and 2020 were $13.2 million, $0.4 million and $(9.3) million, respectively. We expect the foreign currency gain/loss to continue to fluctuate as long as we continue to hold monetary assets and liabilities at those subsidiaries. Market uncertainty could potentially lead to significant volatility with foreign currency exchange rates, which could result in additional foreign currency gain/loss. Foreign Currency Translation Risk We have foreign currency translation risk related to the translation of our foreign consolidated and unconsolidated subsidiaries' assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses from their respective functional currencies to the U.S. dollar at each reporting date. Fluctuations in exchange rates may impact the amount of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses we report on our consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of income. The financial statements of those foreign subsidiaries with functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars using a current exchange rate. Gains and losses resulting from this translation are recognized as a foreign currency translation adjustment within accumulated other comprehensive income, which is a component of shareholders' equity and comprehensive income. Aggregate translation gains (losses), net of tax, for 2022, 2021 and 2020 were $(195.4) million, $(62.0) million and $134.3 million, respectively. 47Table of ContentsForeign Currency Exchange Risk Related to Customer CollateralA portion of performance bond deposits is denominated in various foreign currencies. We mark-to-market all deposits daily and require payment from clearing firms whose collateral has lost value due to changes in foreign currency rates and price. Therefore, our exposure to foreign currency risk related to performance bond deposits is considered minimal and is not expected to be material to our financial condition or operating results.48Table of Contents",2023-12-30 20:16:09.989943

BUSINESS General We are the largest futures exchange in the United States for the trading of futures contracts and options on futures contracts, often called derivatives, as measured by 2006 annual trading volume. For the second consecutive year, our annual trading volume surpassed one billion contracts. We posted record trading volume of 1.3 billion contracts in 2006, an increase of 28% over 2005, which was previously our busiest year. In 2006, our customers, who include our members, traded futures contracts and options on futures contracts with an underlying value of $824 trillion. As of December 31, 2006, our open interest record was 52.5 million contracts set on September 14, 2006. Open interest is the number of outstanding contracts at the close of the trading day at the exchange and is a leading indicator of liquidity. Liquidity of markets, or the ability of a market to quickly and efficiently absorb the execution of large purchases or sales, is key to attracting customers and contributing to a market’s success. Futures and options on futures provide a way to protect against – and potentially profit from – price changes in financial instruments and physical commodities. Futures contracts are legally binding agreements to buy or sell something in the future, such as livestock or foreign currency. The buyer and seller of a futures contract agree on a price today for a product to be delivered and paid for in the future. Each contract specifies the quantity of the item and the time of delivery or payment. An option on a futures contract is a right, but not an obligation, to sell or buy a futures contract at a specified price on or before a certain expiration date. Our products provide a means for hedging, speculation and asset allocation relating to the risks associated with, among other things, interest rate sensitive instruments, equity ownership, changes in the value of foreign currency and changes in the prices of commodities. Our customer base includes professional traders, financial institutions, institutional and individual investors, major corporations, manufacturers, producers and governments. As a marketplace for global risk management, our exchange brings together buyers and sellers of derivatives products, which trade on our CME Globex electronic trading platform, on our trading floors through open outcry and via privately negotiated transactions that we clear. We offer market participants the opportunity to trade futures contracts and options on futures contracts on interest rates, equities, foreign exchange, commodities and alternative investments. Our key products include CME Eurodollar contracts and contracts based on major U.S. stock indexes, such as the S&P 500, NASDAQ-100 and Russell 2000. We also offer contracts for the principal foreign currencies and for a number of commodity products, including cattle, hogs and dairy. We own our clearing house, which is the largest derivatives clearing operation in the world for futures and options on futures, and we clear, settle and guarantee every contract traded through our exchange. Our integrated clearing function is designed to ensure the safety and soundness of our markets and helps differentiate us from our competitors. Our clearing house serves as counterparty to every trade – becoming the buyer to each seller of a futures contract and the seller to each buyer. This process substantially reduces credit risk. Performance bond (collateral) deposits are required at each level in the clearing process – customer to broker, broker to clearing firm, clearing firm to our clearing house. The performance bond is a good-faith deposit that represents the minimum amount of protection against potential losses. As of December 31, 2006, we acted as custodian for approximately $47.4 billion in performance bond collateral, including approximately $6.5 billion in deposits for non-CME products. In addition, ownership of our clearing house enables us to more quickly and efficiently bring new products to market through coordination of our clearing functions with our product development, technology, market regulation and other risk management activities. Our goal is to design our system to service historical peak volumes, provide clearing services to CBOT and other exchanges and clear new products. CME was founded in 1898 as a not-for-profit corporation. In November 2000, we demutualized and became a shareholder-owned corporation. As a consequence, we adopted a for-profit approach to our business, including strategic initiatives aimed at optimizing trading volume, efficiency and liquidity. In December 2002, CME Holdings completed its initial public offering of its Class A common stock and became the first U.S. financial exchange to be publicly traded. 6 In connection with our demutualization, we opened access to our markets by allowing unlimited, direct access to the CME Globex platform for all market participants. Today, any individual or institutional customer guaranteed by a clearing firm is able to obtain direct access to the CME Globex platform. As a result of the increased access to our markets, all market participants now have the ability to view bids and offers in the market. Generally, member customers are charged lower fees than our non-member customers. Certain of our customers benefit from volume discounts and limits on fees as part of our effort to encourage increased liquidity in our markets. In 2006, volume on the CME Globex electronic trading platform represented 71% of our trading volume compared with 70% in 2005. In 2006, we entered into an agreement with the New York Mercantile Exchange, or “NYMEX,” to become the exclusive electronic trading service provider for NYMEX’s energy futures and options contracts and for metals products listed on its COMEX Division. This builds upon our successful clearing processing arrangement with CBOT, which was fully implemented in January 2004. The addition of energy contracts onto CME Globex further diversifies our product offerings and creates the first electronic derivatives trading environment that offers global access to all major asset classes – interest rates, stock indexes, foreign exchange, agricultural commodities, and now, energy. We also recently announced our proposed merger with CBOT Holdings to establish the world’s most diverse global exchange. The combined company, to be named CME Group Inc., or “CME Group,” is expected to create operational and cost efficiencies for market users as well as value for our shareholders. Our principal executive offices are located at 20 South Wacker Drive, Chicago, Illinois 60606, and our telephone number is 312-930-1000. Competitive Strengths We have established ourselves as a premier global marketplace for financial risk management. We believe our principal competitive strengths are: • highly liquid markets; • global benchmark products; • diverse portfolio of products and services; • wholly-owned clearing house; • proven and scalable technology; and • global reach. Highly Liquid Markets. The liquidity in our markets is a key factor in attracting and retaining customers. As of December 31, 2006, our open interest record was 52.5 million contracts set on September 14, 2006. During 2006, we posted record trading volume of 1.3 billion contracts, an increase of 28% over 2005, making us the largest exchange in the United States and the second largest in the world for the trading of futures contracts and options on futures contracts during that period based on annual trading volume. Global Benchmark Products. We believe our key products serve as global benchmarks for valuing and managing risk. Our CME Eurodollar futures contract serves as a global benchmark for measuring the relative value of U.S. dollar-denominated short-term, fixed-income securities. Similarly, the S&P 500, NASDAQ-100 and Russell indexes are considered primary tools for benchmarking investment performance against U.S. equity market exposure. Our S&P 500, NASDAQ-100 and Russell index contracts, which are based on these benchmarks, are recognized by our customers as efficient tools for managing and hedging their equity risks. Diverse Portfolio of Products and Services. We differentiate ourselves from our competitors by developing and offering to our customers a diverse array of products, as well as a broad range of trade execution and clearing services. We have a long history of developing innovative products based on interest rates, equities, foreign exchange, commodities and alternative investments designed to appeal to institutional and individual customers. We offer both electronic order-matching services and open outcry auction trading, and we provide facilities to clear privately negotiated transactions. Our markets provide important risk management tools to our customers. We work closely with our customers to create markets and products that meet their needs. These relationships help us to anticipate and lead industry changes. Wholly-Owned Clearing House. We own our clearing house, which clears, settles and guarantees every contract traded through our exchange, and futures and options on futures contracts traded through CBOT. In 2006, our clearing house cleared an average of 8.6 million contracts daily and 2.1 billion contracts overall. As of December 31, 2006, we acted as custodian for approximately $47.4 billion in performance bond collateral, including approximately $6.5 billion in deposits for non-CME products, and, in 2006, moved an average of $1.7 billion of settlement funds through our clearing system each day. We believe our performance guarantee is a major attraction to our markets, particularly compared to the over-the-counter, or “OTC,” markets, because it substantially reduces counterparty risk. Our clearing system permits more efficient use of capital for our customers by allowing netting of long and short positions in a single type of contract and providing risk offset and cross-margining arrangements with several other leading clearing houses. 7 Proven and Scalable Technology. We believe our ability to use technology effectively has been a key factor in the successful development of our business. As a result of significant investments in our technology asset base, we possess fast, reliable and fully integrated trading and clearing systems. Our goal is to design our highly scalable systems to accommodate additional products with relatively limited modifications. On June 8, 2006, we processed a record of approximately 3.3 million transactions. The core components of our system infrastructure for trading, clearing and risk management are becoming widely adopted throughout the futures industry, resulting in common interfaces and efficiencies for intermediaries and customers. For example, our CME SPAN risk evaluation system has been adopted by more than 50 exchanges and clearing organizations worldwide. Global Reach. Globalization of financial markets is expanding the customer base for futures products beyond traditional boundaries. Our electronic trading services, which are available nearly 24 hours a day and five days per week, position us to take advantage of this development. We have seven international telecommunications hubs in Europe and Asia. These hubs reduce connectivity costs and house direct electronic connections between the foreign customer and CME Globex, our electronic trading platform. In the fall of 2006, to better serve our customers in Asia, we opened our Asia office in Hong Kong and established an additional telecommunications hub in Singapore. We also have international offices in London, Tokyo and Sydney. As a result of our efforts to target global customers, including our international incentive programs, we now have direct customer access to our exchange in over 70 countries. Growth Strategy Our record revenues and annual trading volume in 2006 reflect our focus on strategic advancement through the execution of our growth strategy. We have expanded our core business organically, added innovative new products for global markets, provided trading-related services more broadly and undertaken significant acquisitions and alliances to leverage our core strength and grow our business non-organically. We intend to continue to grow our business by: • generating organic growth; • providing trading-related services; • leveraging our technology; and • advancing new business opportunities. Generating Organic Growth. We intend to advance our position as a leader in the futures industry by generating organic growth by launching new products and expanding into the OTC market. • Add New Products. We create products and product line extensions based on research and development in collaboration with our customers. In 2006, we increased the number of our derivatives contracts to nearly 100, including internationally focused CME S&P Asia 50 futures, CME MSCI EAFE futures and Chinese renminbi and Korean won contracts. We also introduced new futures and options on U.S. housing indexes, which created an opportunity for investors to hedge the $23 trillion U.S. housing market for the first time. • Expanding in the OTC Market. In response to the rapid increase in popularity of foreign exchange as an asset class and the advances in electronic trading, we formed a joint venture with Reuters Group PLC, or “Reuters,” to create the first centrally cleared, global OTC foreign exchange marketplace. Based in London, FXMarketSpace is scheduled to launch in early 2007. This strategic relationship complements our foreign exchange futures and options products and represents an opportunity for us to expand into the $2 trillion per day OTC foreign exchange marketplace. In August 2006, we completed our acquisition of Swapstream, a leading electronic trading platform for interest rate swaps. Swapstream offers advanced functionality for trading interest rate swaps that provides dealers with the flexibility to interact with one or more banks, one or more brokers, or any combination of these to build their own marketplace and distribute their liquidity. The platform also features a sophisticated permission-based system that allows market participants to publish customized prices and pricing curves based on both credit and counterparty considerations. We will provide Swapstream users with greater financial and operational efficiencies by leveraging the capabilities of Clearing 360, a new initiative that offers a comprehensive clearing solution for OTC market participants. 8 Providing Trading-Related Services. Providing third-party transaction processing, clearing and related services is a key element of our strategy, and in 2006 we generated $90 million in revenues from this source. It accounted for 8% of total revenues. Approximately $76 million came from the services that we provide to CBOT through our transaction process agreement initiated in 2003. This strategic relationship generates positive returns and increased efficiencies for CME, CBOT and market users worldwide. In April 2006, we became the exclusive electronic trading service provider for NYMEX’s energy futures and options contracts and for metals products listed on its COMEX Division. Initial trading of NYMEX products under this agreement began in June. Side-by-side electronic trading during regular trading hours began in early September, followed by the launch of COMEX metals products in early December. This relationship accounted for $14 million of our processing services revenue in 2006. We believe we can differentiate ourselves from our competitors by offering these services on a cost-effective basis in combination with the potential to access our broad distribution, customer base and experienced liquidity providers. Leveraging Our Technology. Technology remains a key component of our growth strategy. We made significant enhancements to improve the speed, functionality and reliability of our CME Globex platform. In 2006, we expanded the range of products available to market users on the CME Globex platform; thereby making our markets easier and less expensive to access. In 2006, 956 million contracts traded electronically on our CME Globex platform, an increase of 31% over the total electronic trading volume in 2005 of 730 million contracts. Our commitment to grow electronic options volume remains strong. In 2005, we integrated our enhanced options system for trading CME Eurodollar options into our CME Globex electronic trading platform. This enhanced functionality is designed to facilitate trading of complex combination and spread trades typically used with short-term interest rate options on futures, within a fully transparent and competitive execution environment. In 2006, we also added mass quoting functionality and new market maker programs to increase the liquidity of our options market. In 2006, electronic trading in our options contracts increased to 31.0 million contracts from 11.7 million in 2005. We plan to significantly enhance our functionality with the addition of more user-defined spreads for Eurodollar options in the first quarter of 2007. We also continue to expand our customer base and increase our trading volume by broadening the access, order routing, trading and clearing solutions we offer to existing and prospective customers. We provide our customers with the flexibility to access our markets in the most cost-effective manner for them. In the fourth quarter of 2006, we provided our customer firms the opportunity to connect their co-located trading servers to our network over high-speed fiber optic connections. These server connections are expected to decrease network latency times for order entry to the CME Globex trading platform to less than one millisecond. Advancing New Business Opportunities. We have consistently said that we would focus our merger and acquisition efforts on infrastructure cost savings opportunities in order to create value for our customers and shareholders. To that end, in October 2006, we announced that we had entered into a definitive merger agreement with CBOT Holdings and CBOT. The merger is expected to close by mid-year 2007, subject to a number of approvals, including shareholder, CBOT member and regulatory approvals, as well as completion of customary closing conditions. The combined company is expected to create operational and cost efficiencies for market users. Among other things, we expect the merger to allow us to leverage each company’s distinct product lines for the benefit of customers around the world. We also expect that the merger will result in the extension of our global distribution and customer reach, particularly in Europe and Asia where we already have a significant presence and where we see growth potential. We expect annual expense savings of more than $125 million in the second year following the close. The bulk of the synergies result from reducing technology and administrative costs, and creating more efficient trading floor operations. 9 Products Our broad range of products includes futures contracts and options on futures contracts based on interest rates, equities, foreign exchange, commodities and alternative investments. Our products are traded through the CME Globex electronic trading platform, our open outcry auction markets or through privately negotiated transactions that we clear. For the year ended December 31, 2006, we derived $866.1 million, or 79% of our total revenues, from fees associated with trading and clearing our products. These fees include per contract charges for trade execution, clearing and CME Globex fees. Fees are charged at various rates based on the product traded, the method of trade and the trading privileges of the customer making the trade. Generally, members are charged lower fees than non-members. Certain of our customers benefit from volume discounts and limits on fees as part of our efforts to encourage increased liquidity in our markets. Our markets also generate valuable data and information regarding pricing and trading activity in our products. We identify new products by monitoring economic trends and their impact on the risk management and speculative needs of our existing and prospective customers. The following table shows the average daily volume of contracts traded in our four principal product lines for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004: Average Daily Contract Volume per Product Line CME Product Line Examples of Underlying Instruments 2006 2005 2004 (in thousands) Interest Rates Eurodollar, LIBOR, Euroyen 3,078 2,380 1,705 Equities(1) S&P 500, NASDAQ-100, S&P MidCap 400, Nikkei 225, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 indexes 1,734 1,389 1,161 Foreign Exchange Euro, Japanese yen, British pound, Swiss franc, Canadian dollar 453 334 202 Commodities and Alternative Investments(1) Cattle, hogs, pork bellies, lumber, dairy, weather 78 55 43 (1) CME weather and Goldman Sachs Commodity Index products are included in commodities and alternative investments rather than equities beginning in 2006. Prior period amounts have been adjusted to conform to this presentation. Interest Rate Products. CME interest rate products enable banks and other financial institutions worldwide to hedge interest rate risks, and in turn help to reduce the overall cost of borrowing and financing. Our interest rate products include our global benchmark CME Eurodollar futures contract, which celebrated its 25th anniversary in December 2006. When launched on December 9, 1981, CME Eurodollar futures, which are based on U.S. dollars on deposit in commercial banks located outside the United States, were the world’s first cash-settled futures contract. During 2006, CME Eurodollar futures had an average daily volume of 2.0 million contracts which was 37% of our overall average daily trading volume. Eurodollar futures contracts are used by financial institutions to manage interest rate risks primarily out through five years. We also offer contracts based on other short-term interest rates, such as one-month LIBOR, which stands for the London Interbank Offered Rate, and Euroyen. In October 2006, we launched CME Eurodollar Five-Year E-mini Bundles. The contract is designed to create a more cost effective means of providing exposure for interest rate derivative market participants to the critical five-year point on the U.S. interest rate swap/CME Eurodollar futures curve. Interest rate products represented 58% of our trading volume during 2006, an average of 3.1 million contracts per day. We continue to develop and implement new electronic functionality to accommodate trading strategies required for electronic trading of CME Eurodollar contracts. In July 2006, we launched user-defined covered spreads for options. User-defined spreads provide our customers with a high degree of flexibility as they create unique spread combinations. This new functionality is designed for traders who commonly use volatility strategies to trade Eurodollar options. In 2006, average daily volume of CME Eurodollars traded electronically increased to 1.8 million contracts from 1.3 million in 2005. Since the 2004 launch of our enhanced options system, which was integrated onto CME Globex in 2005, over 25 million CME Eurodollar options have traded electronically. On June 15, 2006, we had record electronic trading in CME Eurodollar options with over 490,000 contracts trading on CME Globex. We intend to continue to introduce functionality that will accommodate other complex trading strategies electronically. For example, we plan to significantly enhance our functionality with the addition of more user-defined spreads for Eurodollar options in the first quarter of 2007. In 2006, we also implemented an incentive program designed to expand electronic trading of Eurodollar options under which owners and lessees of exchange memberships who trade at least 30% of their total CME Eurodollar option volume electronically will be entitled to a discounted fee. 10 We intend to increase our revenues from our interest rate product line by continuing to optimize pricing of existing products, introducing new products to increase our trading volume and enhancing the functionality of our CME Globex electronic platform to increase the electronic trading volume of our options on futures contracts. We have adopted new policies and practices that are closely aligned with customer demand and designed to promote enhanced market penetration. Equity Products. Our equity products permit investors to obtain exposure, for hedging or speculative purposes, to a change in the weighting of one or more equity market sectors more efficiently than by buying or selling the underlying securities. By allowing investors to effectively manage stock market risks, CME equity products increase investor confidence and overall participation in these important markets. We offer trading in futures contracts based upon the S&P 500 Index, NASDAQ-100 Index, certain Russell indexes, including the Russell 2000, and other small-, medium- and large-capitalization domestic indexes and indexes on foreign equity markets. Our total trading volume for equity products rose 24% in 2006, to 435 million contracts, from 350 million contracts in 2005. Trading in these products represented 32% of our total trading volume during 2006, an average of over 1.7 million contracts per day. We have a license agreement with Standard & Poor’s Corporation to use certain S&P stock indexes and the related intellectual property. The license is exclusive through December 31, 2016 and non-exclusive from that date through December 31, 2017 with some exceptions. We also have a license agreement with The Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc., or “NASDAQ,” that allows us to offer futures and options on futures contracts based on the NASDAQ-100 and the NASDAQ Composite indexes exclusively until October 2012 and based on the NASDAQ Biotechnology index provided certain performance criteria are met. We also have a license agreement with Frank Russell Company that allows us to offer futures and options contracts based on certain Russell indexes, including the Russell 2000. For a more detailed discussion of these license agreements, see the section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K entitled “Item 1. Business—Licensing Agreements.” In 2006, 98% of our equity products trading volume was based on the S&P 500 Index, the NASDAQ-100 Index and the Russell 2000 Index. We also offer TRAKRS contracts, which are a series of non-traditional futures contracts developed with Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc. and licensed exclusively to us for North America. These contracts are the first broad-based index products traded on a U.S. futures exchange that can be sold by securities brokers. TRAKRS are designed to enable customers to track an index of stocks, bonds, currencies or other financial instruments. We also offer E-mini contracts, which trade exclusively on our CME Globex platform and are one-fifth the size of their standard counterparts. These products are designed to address the growing demand for equity derivatives and electronically traded products. We believe our leading market position in equity index products is a result of the liquidity of our markets, the status of the S&P 500 and the NASDAQ-100 indexes as two of the principal U.S. financial standards for benchmarking stock market returns, and the appeal to investors and traders of our E-mini products and other equity products and our CME Globex platform. These investors include public and private pension funds, investment companies, mutual funds, insurance companies and other financial services companies that benchmark their investment performance to different segments of the equity markets. We believe future growth in our equity products will come from the introduction of electronically traded options on our existing equity index products, including our E-minis, expanding customer access to our electronic markets, enhancing the functionality of our CME Globex electronic platform to increase the electronic trading volume of our options on futures contracts as well as further educating the marketplace on the benefits of these products. Foreign Exchange Products. CME is the largest regulated market for foreign exchange trading. We became the first exchange to introduce financial futures when we launched foreign exchange futures in 1972. Our foreign exchange market serves as an effective and efficient means of risk transfer for the global foreign exchange market, bringing together a broad array of client segments by offering investment as well as risk management opportunities. Our customers benefit from dealing anonymously in a fully transparent market, where large and small customers have equal access to the same prices and deep pool of liquidity. Our foreign exchange products provide the tools and resources to hedge foreign exchange risk, facilitating cross-border trade and commerce while mitigating the risks to profitability due to fluctuations in the foreign exchange market. Our foreign exchange market attracts both buy- and sell-side investors, including commercial and investment banks, hedge funds, commodity trading advisors, proprietary trading firms and individual investors. Roughly 88% of our foreign exchange products are traded electronically on the CME Globex platform, ensuring that business is transacted quickly with maximum operational efficiency. 11 Today, we offer more than 40 foreign exchange futures and more than 30 foreign exchange options on futures products, covering major as well as a broad array of emerging market currency pairs in the following currencies: Euro, Japanese yen, British pound, Swiss franc, Canadian dollar, Australian dollar, New Zealand dollar, Mexican peso, Brazilian real, Norwegian krone, Swedish krona, Czech koruna, Hungarian forint, Polish zloty, Russian ruble, South African rand, Israeli shekel, Korean won, and Chinese renminbi. In 2006, we saw an average daily volume of 453,000 contracts per day, with a notional value of $55 billion a day. On December 8, 2006, foreign exchange volume reached a record of 1.3 million contracts, reflecting a record notional value of $158 billion. Our total foreign exchange trading volume increased 35% in 2006, with a total of 114 million contracts traded in 2006, versus 84 million in 2005. Trading in our foreign exchange products represented nearly 8.5% of our total trading volume in 2006. In 2006, electronically traded foreign exchange volume increased 46% over 2005, from 68.1 million contracts to 99.5 million contracts. Open outcry trading decreased 26%, from 7.9 million contracts in 2005 to 5.8 million contracts in 2006. We believe future growth in our foreign exchange product line will come from expanding and diversifying our product suite and customer base, as well as the global footprint of our foreign exchange products. We are expanding our foreign exchange options product suite to appeal to a broader array of customer segments, and we expect continued strong growth in the electronic execution of foreign exchange options on CME Globex in 2007. We are also exploring the addition of new currency pairs to our product suite, following the launch of our Israeli shekel, Korean won, and Chinese renminbi contracts in 2006. As we expand our global footprint in the foreign exchange market, we expect increased trading volume from customers outside of the United States. Commodity and Alternative Investment Products. CME commodity and alternative investment products help establish benchmark prices and play an important role in risk management for the agricultural community. These products provide hedging tools for our customers who deal in tangible physical commodities, including agricultural producers of commodities and food processors. Commodity products were our only products when our exchange first opened for business. We have maintained a strong franchise in our commodity products, including futures contracts based on cattle, hogs, pork bellies, lumber and dairy products. We also created a weather derivative market which enables businesses that could be adversely affected by unanticipated temperature swings or unusually high snowfall, to transfer such risks. Commodity and alternative investment products accounted for 1.5% of our trading volume during 2006, an average of more than 78,000 contracts per day and an increase of 41% from 2005. On September 13, 2006, we had our highest volume day ever with 156,000 contracts traded. We continue to execute our strategy of growing our customer base and providing side-by-side access to our commodity markets. For example, in December 2006, we launched electronic trading of options on CME Live Cattle and Lean Hog futures. We also added new functionality for our Dairy Class III Milk futures to enable customers to hedge their dairy positions for longer durations with a single trade execution. We believe the changing perception of commodities as an asset class provides an opportunity for growth in our markets. Market Data and Information Products. Our markets generate valuable information regarding prices and trading activity in our products. The market data we supply is a key component to making trading decisions. We sell our market data, which includes information about bids, offers, trades and trade size, to banks, broker-dealers, pension funds, investment companies, mutual funds, insurance companies, individual investors and other financial services companies or organizations that use our markets or monitor general economic conditions. We distribute our market data directly to our electronic trading customers as part of their access to our markets through our electronic facilities. We also distribute market data via dedicated networks to quote vendors who consolidate our market data with that from other exchanges, other third party data providers and news services, and then resell their consolidated data. Revenues from market data products totaled $80.8 million, or 7% of our total revenues, in 2006. We continue to enhance our current market data and information product offerings by packaging the basic data we have traditionally offered with advanced analytical data and information. For example, in September 2006, we announced an upgrade option to our market data offerings to include top five price levels of bids and offers for any electronically-traded CME futures product as part of each CME market data package. Previously this was only available as an add-on service. The expanded data set offered in each package will provide CME data subscribers a deeper view of the market, including price, volume and liquidity beginning in January 2007. As part of our market data and information products business we also supply services to OneChicago and S&P in connection with the usage reporting, contract administration and associated billing and revenue collection for the display and integration of their market data into our standard market data distribution. 12 Execution Our primary trade execution facilities consist of our CME Globex electronic trading platform and our open outcry trading floors. Both of these execution facilities offer our customers immediate trade execution and price transparency and are supported by substantial infrastructure and technology for order routing, trade reporting, market data dissemination and market surveillance and regulation. In addition, trades can be executed through privately negotiated transactions that are cleared and settled through our clearing house. The following chart shows the range of trade execution choices we provide our customers in some of our key products. CME Product Open Outcry CME Globex Daytime CME GlobexNighttime Privately Negotiated Transactions Eurodollar x x x x Standard S&P 500 x — x x Standard NASDAQ-100 x — x x E-mini S&P 500 — x x x E-mini NASDAQ-100 — x x x Foreign Exchange x x x x Commodity x x x x CME Globex Electronic Trading Platform. The CME Globex electronic trading platform maintains an electronic, centralized order book and trade execution algorithm for futures contracts and options on futures contracts and allows users to enter orders directly into the order book. Initially, our electronic trading platform was used to offer our products to customers after the close of our regular daytime trading sessions. Today, however, we trade some of our most successful products on the CME Globex platform nearly 24 hours a day, five days a week. In 2006, 71% of our trading volume was executed using CME Globex, compared with 70% in 2005. During 2006, approximately 74% of our clearing and transaction fees revenue was derived from electronic trading. On December 1, 2006, CME Globex volume set a new single-day record of 8.0 million contracts traded. Open Outcry Trading. Open outcry trading represented 28% of our total trading volume in 2006. The trading floors are the centralized meeting place for floor traders and floor brokers representing customer orders to trade contracts. The trading floors, covering approximately 70,000 square feet, have tiered booths surrounding the pits from which clearing firm personnel can communicate with customers regarding current market activity and prices and receive orders either electronically or by telephone. In addition, our trading floors display current market information and news on electronic wallboards hung above the pits. During 2006, approximately 21% of our clearing and transaction fees revenue was derived from open outcry trading. Privately Negotiated Transactions. In addition to offering traditional open outcry and electronic trading through the CME Globex platform, we permit qualified customers to trade our products by entering into privately negotiated transactions, which are reported and included in the market data we distribute. We also clear, settle and guarantee these transactions through our clearing house. Some market participants value privately negotiated transactions as a way to ensure that large transactions can be completed at a single price or in a single transaction while preserving their ability to effectively complete a hedging, risk management or other trading strategy. During 2006, approximately 5% of our clearing and transaction fees revenue was derived from this type of trading. Other Trading Platforms. CME economic derivatives trade on the CME Auction Markets platform. The auctions are conducted using a patented process of mutualized order-filling developed and operated by Longitude LLC, an International Securities Exchange company. Additionally, as a result of our acquisition of Swapstream, we now offer the ability to trade the euro- and Swiss franc-denominated medium-term and long-term interest rate swaps and spread trading on the Swapstream platform. Future plans for enhancing the platform include the addition of the launch of short-term maturities, U.S. dollar-and the British pound-denominated swaps. 13 Clearing We operate our own clearing house that clears, settles and guarantees the performance of all transactions matched through our execution facilities and futures contracts and options on futures contracts traded through CBOT. In 2006, our clearing house cleared an average of 8.6 million contracts daily and 2.1 billion contracts overall. Many derivatives exchanges do not provide clearing services for trades matched through their execution facilities, relying instead on outside clearing houses to provide these services. Ownership and control of our own clearing house enables us to capture the revenue associated with both the trading and clearing of our products. This is particularly important for trade execution alternatives such as privately negotiated block trades, where we can derive a higher clearing fee for each contract traded compared to other trades. By owning our clearing house, we also control the cost structure and the technology development cycle for our clearing services. It also helps us manage our new product initiatives without being dependent on an outside entity. We believe having an integrated clearing function provides significant competitive advantages. Additionally, owning our own clearing house allows us to generate additional revenue by providing clearing services to other exchanges, such as CBOT. As of December 31, 2006, our open interest stood at 35.1 million contracts and our open interest record was 52.5 million contracts set on September 14, 2006. As of December 31, 2006, we acted as custodian for approximately $47.4 billion in performance bond collateral deposited by our clearing firms and, during 2006, we moved an average of approximately $1.7 billion a day in settlement funds through our clearing system. In addition, our clearing house guarantees the performance of our contracts with a financial safeguards package of approximately $4.6 billion. Open interest in CBOT products cleared by our clearing house on December 31, 2006 was 14.9 million contracts. The clearing function provides three primary benefits to our markets: efficient, high-volume transaction processing; cost and capital efficiencies; and a reliable credit guarantee. The services we provide can be broadly categorized as follows: • transaction processing and position management; • cross-margining and mutual offset services; • market protection and risk management; • settlement, collateral and delivery services; and • investment services. Transaction Processing and Position Management. Our CLEARING 21 system developed with NYMEX in the early 1990s processes reported trades and positions on a real-time basis, providing users with instantaneous information on trades, positions and risk exposure. CLEARING 21 is able to process trades in futures and options products, securities and cash instruments. CLEARING 21 can also support complex new product types, including combinations, options on combinations, options on options, swaps, repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements, and other instruments. Through CLEARING 21 user interfaces, our clearing firms can electronically manage their positions, exercise options, enter transactions related to foreign exchange deliveries, manage collateral posted to meet performance bond requirements and access all of our other on-line applications. Together with our order routing and trade matching services, we offer straight-through electronic processing of transactions in which an order is electronically routed, matched, cleared and made available to the clearing firm’s back-office systems for further processing. Cross-Margining and Mutual Offset Services. We have led the derivatives industry in establishing cross-margining agreements with other leading clearing houses. Cross-margining arrangements reduce capital costs for clearing firms and customers. These agreements permit an individual clearing house to recognize a clearing firm’s open positions at other participating clearing houses, and clearing firms are able to offset risks of positions held at one clearing house against those held at other participating clearing houses. This arrangement reduces the need for collateral deposits by the clearing firm. For example, our cross-margining program with the Options Clearing Corporation reduced performance bond requirements for our members by approximately $2.0 billion a day in 2006. We have implemented cross-margining arrangements with NYMEX, the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation and LCH.Clearnet Group for positions at the London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange that are cleared through LCH.Clearnet Group. In addition, our mutual offset agreement with the Singapore Derivatives Exchange allows a clearing firm of either exchange initiating trades in certain products on either exchange to execute after-hours trades at the other exchange in those products and then transfer them back to the originating exchange. This mutual offset arrangement enables firms to execute trades at either exchange virtually 24 hours per day. This arrangement has been in place since 1984 and was renewed in October 2006 for an additional three year term with automatic renewals for one year each unless terminated by either party. 14 Market Protection and Risk Management. Our clearing house guarantee of performance is a significant attraction, and an important part of the functioning of our exchange. Because of this guarantee, our customers do not need to evaluate the credit of each potential counterparty or limit themselves to a selected set of counterparties. This flexibility increases the potential liquidity available for each trade. Additionally, the substitution of our clearing house as the counterparty to every transaction allows our customers to establish a position with one party and then to offset the position with another party. This contract offsetting process provides our customers with flexibility in establishing and adjusting positions and provides for performance bond efficiencies. In order to ensure performance, we establish and monitor financial requirements for our clearing firms. We also set minimum performance bond requirements for our traded products. Our clearing house uses our proprietary CME SPAN software, which determines the appropriate performance bond requirements by simulating the gains and losses of complex portfolios. We typically hold performance bond collateral to cover at least 95% of price changes for a given product within a given historical period. Performance bond requirements for a clearing firm’s or customer’s overall portfolio are calculated using CME SPAN. At each settlement cycle, our clearing house values, at the market price prevailing at that time, or marks-to-market, all open positions and requires payments from clearing firms whose positions have lost value and makes payments to clearing firms whose positions have gained value. Our clearing house marks-to-market all open positions at least twice a day, and more often if market volatility warrants. Marking-to-market provides both participants in a transaction with an accounting of their financial obligations under the contract. Having a mark-to-market cycle of a minimum of two times a day helps protect the financial integrity of our clearing house, our clearing firms and market participants. This allows our clearing house to identify quickly any clearing firms that may not be able to satisfy the financial obligations resulting from changes in the prices of their open contracts before those financial obligations become exceptionally large and jeopardize the ability of our clearing house to ensure performance of their open positions. In the unlikely event of a payment default by a clearing firm, we would first apply assets of the clearing firm to cover its payment obligation. These assets include security deposits, performance bonds and any other available assets, such as the proceeds from the sale of Class A and Class B common stock and trading rights of the clearing firm at our exchange owned by or assigned to the clearing firm. In addition, we would make a demand for payment pursuant to any applicable guarantee provided to the exchange by the parent of a clearing firm. Thereafter, if the payment default remains unsatisfied, we would use our surplus funds, security deposits of other clearing firms and funds collected through an assessment against all other solvent clearing firms to satisfy the deficit. We maintain a committed $800 million 364-day revolving line of credit with a consortium of banks. We increased the facility from $750 million to $800 million in 2006 in connection with its annual renewal. We have the option to increase the facility from $800 million to $1 billion, subject to approval by the participating banks. We are required to post additional collateral in connection with any such increase. This line of credit may also be utilized if there is a temporary disruption with the domestic payments system that would delay settlement payments between our clearing house and clearing firms. The credit agreement requires us to pledge clearing firm security deposits held by us in the form of U.S. Treasury or agency securities, as well as security deposit funds in our second Interest Earning Facility program, called “IEF2,” to the line of credit custodian prior to drawing on the line. Performance bond collateral of a defaulting clearing firm may also be used to secure a draw on the line. 15 The following shows the available assets of our clearing house at December 31, 2006 in the event of a payment default by a CME clearing firm: CME Clearing House Available Assets (in millions) Aggregate Performance Bond Deposits by All Clearing Firms(1) $ 47,432 Market Value of CME Pledged Shares/Trading Rights (minimum requirement per firm)(2) $ 10 CME Surplus Funds(3) 154 Security Deposits of Clearing Firms(4) 1,193 Limited Assessment Powers(5) 3,281 Minimum Total Assets Available for Default(6) $ 4,638 (1) Aggregate performance bond deposits by all clearing firms includes cash performance bond deposits of $506 million and the value assigned by our exchange for securities deposited to satisfy performance bond requirements. This assigned value for securities is generally less than the market value of the securities deposited. (2) The market value of CME pledged shares/trading rights represents the minimum number of specified trading rights, shares of our Class B common stock associated with those trading rights and the 15,000 shares of our Class A common stock required to be pledged to our clearing house by a firm clearing only CME products as of December 31, 2006. The market value of the trading rights is based on the average of the bid and offer for the trading rights and associated Class B shares at December 29, 2006. The market value of the Class A shares is based on the closing price of $509.75 on the New York Stock Exchange on December 29, 2006. Effective as of February 1, 2007, the requirement to pledge shares of our Class A common stock was decreased from 15,000 to 8,000 for new clearing firms. For existing clearing firms on or before February 1, 2007, the number of Class A shares that must be pledged to us was decreased incrementally by approximately 2,300 shares per month over a three-month period. This decrease represents our third decrease in the requirement since 2004. In addition, we have a first priority lien on CBOT membership interests and shares of Class A common stock of CBOT Holdings pledged to us by clearing members of the CBOT. As of December 31, 2006, the market value of the minimum requirement of pledged membership interests/shares per CBOT clearing member was $4.7 million. The market value of the pledged memberships was based on the average of the bid and offer for such membership interests on December 29, 2006. The market value of the pledged shares of Class A common stock of CBOT Holdings was based upon the closing price of $151.47 on the New York Stock Exchange on December 29, 2006. (3) CME surplus funds represent the amount of our working capital reduced by an amount necessary to support our short-term operations. (4) Security deposits of clearing firms include security deposits required of clearing firms, but do not include any excess deposits held by our exchange at the direction of the clearing firms. (5) In the event of a clearing firm default, if a loss continues to exist after the utilization of the assets of the defaulted firm, our surplus funds and the security deposits of non-defaulting firms, we have the right to assess all non-defaulting clearing members up to 2.75 times their existing security deposit requirements. (6) Represents the aggregate minimum resources available to satisfy any obligations not met by a defaulting firm able to clear both CME and CBOT products subsequent to the liquidation of the defaulting firm’s performance bond collateral. Settlement, Collateral and Delivery Services. We manage final settlement in all of our contracts, including cash settlement, physical delivery of selected commodities, and option exercises and assignments. Because some initial and maintenance performance bonds from clearing firms, as well as mark-to-market obligations on some of our contracts, are denominated in various foreign currencies, we offer multi-currency performance bond and settlement services. We also offer the Moneychanger function to our clearing firms. This service provides members with access to overnight funds in various foreign currencies at competitive bid/ask spreads free of charge to satisfy the terms of a foreign currency denominated futures contract. Generally, although more than 95% of all futures contracts are liquidated before the expiration of the contract, the underlying financial instruments or commodities for the remainder of the contracts must be delivered. We act as the delivery agent for all CME contracts, ensuring timely delivery by the seller of the exact quality and quantity specified in a contract and full and timely payment by the buyer. 16 To administer its system of financial safeguards efficiently, our clearing house has developed banking relationships with a network of major U.S. banks and banking industry infrastructure providers, such as the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications. Among the key services provided to our clearing house by these banks and service providers are a variety of custody, credit and payment services that support the substantial financial commitments and processes backing the guarantee of our clearing house to market participants. Investment Services. In order to achieve collateral efficiencies for our clearing firms, we have established a number of collateral programs under the designation Interest Earning Facility, or “IEF.” Under this program, our clearing firms may select from four different IEF programs to meet their individual needs. The programs are designed to enable our clearing firms to make optimal use of the demand deposit cash accounts and security accounts they have established to satisfy our performance bond requirements. We earn fee income in return for providing these value-added services to our clearing firms. Our clearing house launched a securities lending program in 2001 using a portion of certain securities deposited to meet the proprietary performance bond requirements of our clearing firms. Under this securities lending program, we lend a security to a third party and receive collateral in the form of cash. The majority of the cash is then invested on an overnight basis to generate interest income. The related interest expense represents payment to the borrower of the security for the cash collateral retained during the duration of the lending transaction. Securities on loan are marked-to-market daily and compared to collateral received. Technology Our operation of both electronic and open outcry trading facilities and a clearing house has influenced the design and implementation of the technologies that support our operations. Trading Technology. We have a proven track record of operating successful electronic and open outcry markets by developing and integrating multiple, evolving technologies that support a growing and substantial trading volume. The integrated suite of technologies we employ to accomplish this has been designed to support a significant expansion of our current business and provides us with an opportunity to leverage our technology base into new markets, products and services. As electronic trading activity expands, we continue to provide greater match engine functionality unique to various markets, market models and product types. We have adopted a modular approach to technology development and engineered an integrated set of solutions that support multiple specialized markets. We continually monitor and upgrade our capacity requirements. Our goal is to design our systems to handle at least one and a half times our historical peak transactions in our highest volume products. Significant investments in production planning, quality assurance and certification processes have enhanced our ability to expedite the delivery of the system enhancements that we develop for our customers. We will continue to need to expand and upgrade our technology and systems to respond to increases in trading volume and order transaction traffic. Speed, reliability, scalability, capacity and functionality are critical performance criteria for electronic trading platforms. A substantial portion of our operating budget is dedicated to system design, development and operations in order to achieve high levels of overall system performance. In 2006, we enhanced our CME Globex platform, including our market data platform that now uses 50% less bandwidth than legacy systems. We also plan to significantly enhance our functionality with the addition of more user-defined spreads for CME Eurodollar options in the first quarter of 2007. User-defined spreads provide our customers with a high degree of flexibility as they create unique spread combinations. We also have two remote data facilities to provide additional system capacity and redundancy for our trading and clearing technology. Our data centers support our customer interfaces, trading and execution systems, as well as clearing and settlement operations. Additionally, in the fourth quarter of 2006, we provided our customer firms the opportunity to connect their co-located trading servers to our network over high-speed fiber optic connections. These server connections are expected to decrease network latency times for order entry to the CME Globex trading platform to less than one millisecond. 17 The technology systems supporting our trading operations can be divided into five major categories: Distribution Technologies that support the ability of customers to access our trading systems from terminals through network access to our trading floor and/or electronic trading environments. Order routing/order management Technologies that control the flow of orders to the trading floor or electronic trading systems and that monitor the status of and modify submitted orders. Trade matching (electronic market) Technologies that aggregate submitted orders and electronically match buy and sell orders when their trade conditions are met. Market data Technologies that distribute order information to our end user customers under the CME market data platform. Trading floor operations Technologies that maximize market participants’ ability to capitalize on opportunities present in both the trading floor and electronic markets that we operate. The CME Globex electronic trading platform includes the distribution, order routing, order management, trade matching and market data technology. CME Globex’s modularity and functionality enable us to selectively add products with unique trading characteristics onto the trading platform. The distribution technologies we offer differentiate our platform and bring liquidity and trading volume to our execution facilities. As of December 31, 2006, we had more than 1,100 direct connections with our systems. Many of these customers connect through a dedicated private network that is readily available, has wide distribution and provides fast connections in the Americas, Europe and Asia. We have also established telecommunications hubs in Amsterdam, Dublin, Gibraltar, London, Milan, Paris and Singapore to respond to customer requests and reduce the cost of trading for our foreign customers. We now have direct customer access to our exchange in over 70 countries. In order routing and management, we offer a range of mechanisms and were among the first U.S. derivatives exchanges to fully implement the FIX 4.2 protocol—the standard order routing protocol used within the securities industry. In addition, our order routing and order management systems are capable of supporting multiple electronic trading match engines. This functionality gives us great latitude in the types of markets that we choose to serve. Several key technology platforms and standards are used to support these activities, including fault-tolerant Non-Stop (Tandem systems), IBM mainframes, Sun Microsystems and Hewlett Packard servers, Hewlett Packard and Dell PCs, Oracle and DB2 databases, LINUX, UNIX, Novell, TIBCO middleware and multi-vendor network solutions. In 2006, we integrated Hewlett Packard’s new Integrity NonStop Servers that incorporate Intel Itanium processors into CME Globex. This has improved response time to between 20 and 40 milliseconds while accommodating significantly higher trading volume. Our futures match engine is based upon the computerized trading and match software known as the NSC system. We have a long-term license from Euronext-Paris, under which we have the ability to modify and upgrade the performance of the basic NSC system to optimize its performance to suit our needs. We have a fully trained development team that maintains, upgrades and customizes our version of the NSC system. The customized enhancements that we have developed address the unique trading demands of each marketplace that we serve. We continue to focus on performance features of the match engine and presently have multiple enhancements under development. Our options match engine was designed and built at CME with focus on the speed of matching buy and sell orders and fault tolerance for 24-hour trading. We work on continuous enhancements to build a fully-functional electronic marketplace for options where our customers can offset their risk with as much ease as in our open outcry trading facilities. We also offer user-defined functionality for customers to create and trade customized spreads of instruments. Clearing Technology. CLEARING 21, our clearing and settlement software, and CME SPAN, our margining and risk management software, form the core of our clearing technology. CLEARING 21 is a system for high-volume, high-capacity clearing and settlement of exchange-based transactions that we developed jointly with NYMEX in the early 1990s. The system offers clearing firms improved efficiency and reduced costs. CLEARING 21’s modular design gives us the ability to rapidly introduce new products. The software can be customized to meet the unique needs of specialized markets. 18 CME SPAN is our sophisticated margining and risk management software. CME SPAN has now been adopted by more than 50 exchanges and clearing organizations worldwide. This software simulates the effects of changing market conditions on a complex portfolio and uses standard options pricing models to determine a portfolio’s overall risk. CME SPAN then generates a performance bond requirement that typically covers 95% of price changes within a given historical period. Strategic Relationships Chicago Board of Trade. Pursuant to an agreement entered into in April 2003, we have been providing clearing processing services to CBOT since November 2003. In providing services to CBOT, our clearing house clears, settles and guarantees all CBOT transactions, using the full resources of our clearing processes and financial safeguards package. We cleared 806 million contracts for CBOT in 2006. Open interest for CBOT contracts was 14.9 million contracts at December 31, 2006. The initial term of the agreement is until January 2009. Upon the expiration, CBOT may in its sole discretion renew the agreement for an additional one-year term. On October 17, 2006, we entered into an agreement and plan of merger with CBOT Holdings relating to the merger of CBOT Holdings into CME Holdings. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement and subject to the conditions thereof, CBOT Holdings stockholders will have the right to receive 0.3006 shares of CME Holdings Class A common stock per share of CBOT Holdings Class A common stock (the exchange ratio) or to elect an amount in cash per share equal to the value of the exchange ratio based on a ten day average of closing prices of our Class A common stock at the time of the merger. The cash portion of the consideration is subject to a $3 billion aggregate limit and will be subject to proration if total cash elections by CBOT shareholders exceed that limitation. Subject to an affirmative vote by CME Holdings and CBOT Holdings stockholders and CBOT members, normal regulatory approvals and other closing conditions, the transaction is expected to close by mid-year 2007. Longitude. In 2005, we partnered with Goldman Sachs to provide a clearing solution for its auction markets through the launch of CME economic derivatives. The patented technology used to fill orders for auction products is supplied by Longitude. CME economic derivatives provide a way of hedging and initiating portfolio risk on macro-economic events and are based on key U.S. and European economic indicators, including the U.S. initial jobless claims. These products are traded in CME Auction Markets. In 2006, we made these products available on our CME Globex platform. In 2006, Goldman Sachs terminated its relationship with Longitude and us with respect to auction markets. We continue to distribute and clear CME Auction Markets pursuant to an agreement with International Securities Exchange, the owner of Longitude. New York Mercantile Exchange. On April 6, 2006, we entered into a definitive technology services agreement with NYMEX pursuant to which we became the exclusive electronic trading service provider for NYMEX’s energy futures and options contracts and for metals products listed on its COMEX Division. The agreement has a ten-year term from the launch date with rolling three-year extensions unless either party elects not to renew the agreement upon written notice prior to the beginning of the applicable renewal term. For our services, we will receive a minimum annual payment or per trade fees based on average daily volume, whichever is greater. During the term of the agreement, we are prohibited from listing products that are competitive contracts (as defined in the agreement) to the NYMEX products that are listed on the CME Globex platform provided minimum trading volumes are met. NYMEX remains responsible for clearing its contracts listed on CME Globex and for the performance of all related regulatory oversight functions. The agreement may be terminated: (i) for a material default, (ii) in the event of bankruptcy, (iii) for legal impairment, (iv) for failure to meet specified launch dates, (v) by either party between the fifth and sixth year anniversary of the first launch date upon written notice and payment of a termination fee, (vi) for force majeure or (vii) in the event of an acquisition of a competitor or the listing of competitive products by us. Since launching NYMEX products on CME Globex on June 11, 2006, we averaged 248,000 NYMEX contracts per day in 2006. OneChicago. OneChicago is our joint venture with the Chicago Board Options Exchange, or “CBOE,” and CBOT for the trading of single stock futures and futures based on narrow-based stock indexes. OneChicago develops, lists for trading, markets, regulates, clears and settles transactions in single-stock, as well as futures on exchange traded funds and on narrow-based indices. On March 15, 2006, Interactive Brokers Group LLC made an investment for a 40% interest in OneChicago. As a result, our ownership in the joint venture decreased from approximately 40% to 24%. Reuters. In May 2006, we entered into an agreement with Reuters to create FXMarketSpace Limited, the first centrally-cleared, global foreign exchange marketplace, through a joint venture owned 50% each by CME Holdings and Reuters. Through the joint venture, expected to launch in early 2007, we will combine our expertise in data dissemination, distribution, trade matching and central counterparty clearing services. We will provide the joint venture with trade matching, central counterparty clearing and market regulation services. Reuters will provide the joint venture with graphical user interface access, data distribution and trade notification services. FXMarketSpace will offer market solutions to capitalize on the growing demand for broader access to the foreign exchange market, the emergence of foreign exchange as an asset class, the growth of non-bank financial institutions in global foreign exchange markets and the growth of electronic and algorithmic trading. FXMarketSpace is expected to operate alongside existing electronic transactional systems including Reuters Dealing 3000 for interbank trading, Reuters Trading for Foreign Exchange for dealer to buyside connectivity and our foreign exchange futures and options markets on our CME Globex platform. 19 Singapore Derivatives Exchange Ltd. In October 2006, we renewed our mutual offset agreement with the Singapore Derivatives Exchange for an additional three year term. This relationship allows a clearing firm of either exchange initiating trades in certain products on either exchange to execute after-hours trades at the other exchange in those products, then transfer them back to the originating exchange. Marketing Programs and Advertising Our marketing programs primarily target institutional customers and, to a lesser extent, individual traders. Our marketing programs for institutional customers aim to inform traders, portfolio managers, corporate treasurers and other market professionals about novel uses of our products, such as new hedging and risk management strategies. We also strive to educate these users about changes in product design, performance bond requirements and new clearing services. We participate in major domestic and international trade shows and seminars regarding futures contracts and options on futures contracts and other derivatives products. In addition, we sponsor educational workshops and marketing events designed to educate market users about our products. Through these relationships and programs, we attempt to understand the needs of our customer base and use information provided by them to drive our product development efforts. Our advertising strategies seek to increase awareness and strengthen perceptions of CME among our institutional and retail customers, as well as support an increase in our trading volume. In September 2006, we launched a new global brand advertising campaign. The print campaign, “Smart People, Great Results,” prominently features testimonials from some of our leading global customers – fund managers, financial advisors and professional traders – showing how our benchmark futures and options products improve the way markets work and enable them to achieve positive financial results. We also engaged VSA Partners, Inc. as our agency of record in December 2006 to create an integrated marketing program to reflect our evolution and role in the world economy. Our primary method of advertising has been through print media, utilizing trade magazines and newsletters as well as daily business publications. However, we also use on-line, television sponsorship and other targeted advertisements to reach our target audiences. In July 2005, we launched CME Magazine, a publication designed to keep customers up-to-date on developments at CME that can enhance their participation in the derivatives industry. CME Magazine features customer case histories, trend stories, editorials and news briefs. The magazine is published several times a year and is available on our Web site. Competition Prior to the passage of the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000, or the “CFMA,” futures trading was generally required to take place on or subject to the rules of a federally designated contract market. The costs and difficulty of obtaining contract market designation, complying with applicable regulatory requirements, establishing efficient execution facilities and liquidity pools and attracting customers created significant barriers to entry for competing exchanges. The CFMA eroded the historical dominance by the exchanges of futures trading in the United States by, among other things, eliminating uncertainty with respect to the enforceability of private transactions in most futures contracts and similar products, authorizing the use of electronic trading systems to conduct both private and public futures transactions, and lowering or eliminating entry barriers for new exchanges. For a more detailed description of the regulation of our industry and the regulatory changes brought on by the CFMA, see the section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K entitled “Item 1. Business—Regulatory Matters.” The CFMA and other changing market dynamics have led to increasing competition in all aspects of our business from a number of different domestic and international sources of varied size, business objectives and resources. We now face competition from other futures, securities and securities option exchanges; OTC markets and clearing organizations; consortia formed by our members and large market participants; alternative trade execution facilities; technology firms, including market data distributors and electronic trading system developers; and other competitors. At year-end 2006, there were 57 futures exchanges located in 30 countries, including nine futures exchanges in the United States. The global derivatives industry has grown increasingly competitive. Exchanges, intermediaries, and even end users are consolidating, and OTC and unregulated entities are constantly evolving. For example, in response to growing competition, many marketplaces in both Europe and the United States have demutualized to provide greater flexibility for future growth. CBOT and the IntercontinentalExchange, Inc., or “ICE,” completed their initial public offerings in 2005 and NYMEX went public in 2006. In September 2006, ICE and the New York Board of Trade, or “NYBOT,” entered into a merger agreement pursuant to which NYBOT will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of ICE and ICE will obtain NYBOT’s clearing house. In December 2006, shareholders of NYSE Group and Euronext approved the merger of equals between the companies that was announced in June 2006. Additionally, 20 because equity futures contracts are alternatives to underlying stocks and a variety of equity option and other contracts provide an alternative means of obtaining exposure to the equity markets, we also compete with the NYSE and other securities and options exchanges, dealer markets such as NASDAQ and alternative trading systems in this product line. OTC markets for foreign exchange and fixed-income derivatives products also compete with us. The largest foreign exchange markets are operated primarily as electronic trading systems. Two of the largest of these, operated by Electronic Brokering Services and Reuters, serve primarily professional foreign exchange trading firms. Additional electronic platforms designed to serve corporate foreign exchange users have emerged. Two of these are operated by consortia of interdealer and interbank market participants. A third is a proprietary trading system. In addition, certain provisions of the CFMA have led to an increase in unregulated electronic and brokerage trading systems in the foreign exchange market. The OTC fixed-income derivatives market is by far the largest fixed-income derivatives marketplace. The OTC market consists primarily of interbank and interdealer market participants. There is currently no single liquidity pool in the OTC fixed-income derivatives market that is comparable to our Eurodollar market. The OTC market for fixed-income derivatives products has traditionally been limited to more customized products, and the large credit exposures created in this market and the absence of clearing facilities have limited participation to the most creditworthy institutional participants. However, the size of this market and technology-driven developments in electronic trading and clearing facilities, as well as regulatory changes implemented by the CFMA, increase the likelihood that one or more substantial liquidity pools will emerge in the future in the OTC fixed-income derivatives market. Alternative trade execution facilities that currently specialize in the trading of equity securities have electronic trade execution and routing systems that also can be used to trade products that compete with our products. Technology companies, market data and information vendors and front-end software vendors also represent potential competitors because, as purveyors of market data, these firms typically have substantial distribution capabilities. As technology firms, they also have access to trading engines that can be connected to their data and information networks. Additionally, technology and software firms that develop trading systems, hardware and networks that are otherwise outside of the financial services industry may be attracted to enter our markets. We also face a threat of trading volume loss if a significant number of our traditional participants decide to trade futures or similar products among themselves without using any exchange or specific trading system. The CFMA allows nearly all of our largest customers to transact futures or similar products directly with each other. While those transactions raise liquidity and credit concerns, they may be attractive based on execution costs, flexibility of terms, negotiability of margin or collateral deposits, or other considerations. Additionally, changes under the CFMA permitting the establishment of stand-alone clearing facilities for futures and OTC derivatives transactions will facilitate the mitigation of credit-risk concentrations arising from such transactions. We believe competition among exchanges in the derivatives and securities businesses is based on a number of factors, including, among others: • depth and liquidity of markets; • transaction costs; • breadth of product offerings and rate and quality of new product development; • transparency, reliability and anonymity in transaction processing; • connectivity; • technological capability and innovation; • efficient and secure settlement, clearing and support services; and • reputation. We believe that we compete favorably with respect to these factors, and that our deep, liquid markets; breadth of product offerings; rate and quality of new product development; and efficient, secure settlement, clearing and support services distinguish us from our competitors. We believe that in order to maintain our competitive position, we must continue to develop new and innovative products; enhance our technology infrastructure, including its reliability and functionality; and maintain liquidity and low transaction costs. Our business is highly competitive. We expect competition to continue to intensify, particularly as a result of technological advances and the CFMA and other changes introduced by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, or “CFTC,” which have reduced the regulatory requirements for the development and entry of products and markets that are competitive with our own. Additional factors 21 that may intensify competition in the future include: the growth of recently-formed for-profit exchanges; the consolidation of exchanges, customers or intermediaries; an increased acceptance of electronic trading and electronic order routing by our customer base; and the ability of other exchanges leveraging their technology investment and electronic distribution to enter new markets and list the products of other exchanges. In addition to the competition we face in our derivatives business, we face a number of competitors in our transaction processing and other business services, including: • other exchanges and clearing houses seeking to leverage their infrastructure; and • technology firms, including front-end developers, back-office processing systems firms and match-engine developers. We believe competition in the transaction processing and business services market is based on, among other things, the cost of the services provided; quality and reliability of the services; timely delivery of the services; reputation; and value of linking with existing products, markets and distribution. Regulatory Matters The Commodity Exchange Act, the scope of which was significantly expanded in 1974, subjected us to comprehensive regulation by the CFTC. Under the 1974 amendments, the CFTC was granted exclusive jurisdiction over futures contracts (and options on such contracts and on commodities). Such contracts were generally required to be traded on regulated exchanges known as contract markets. The Commodity Exchange Act placed our business in a heavily regulated environment but imposed significant barriers to unregulated competition. In 2000, the CFMA significantly altered the regulatory landscape and has had important competitive consequences. This legislation greatly expanded the freedom of regulated markets, like ours, to innovate and respond to competition. It also permits us to offer a previously prohibited set of products—single stock futures and futures on narrow-based indexes of securities. The provisions that permit us to trade these security futures products require a novel sharing of jurisdiction between the CFTC and the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the “SEC.” Exchange trading of these security futures products is subject to more burdensome regulation than our other futures products. For example, in order to trade these products, we are required to “notice register” with the SEC as a special purpose national securities exchange solely for the purpose of trading security futures products, and the SEC is authorized to review some of our rules relating to these security futures products. Our members trading those products are subject to registration requirements and duties and obligations to customers under the securities laws that do not pertain to their other futures business. The CFMA excluded or exempted many of the activities of our non-exchange competitors from regulation under the Commodity Exchange Act. The CFMA created broad exclusions and exemptions from the Commodity Exchange Act that permit derivatives contracts, which may serve the same or similar functions as the contracts we offer, to be sold in the largely unregulated OTC market, including through electronic trading facilities. Additionally, the CFMA permits SEC-regulated and bank clearing organizations to clear a broad array of derivatives products in addition to the products that such clearing organizations have traditionally cleared. The CFMA also permits banks and broker-dealers, and some of their affiliates, to offer and sell foreign exchange futures to retail customers without being subject to regulation under the Commodity Exchange Act. The CFMA created a flexible regulatory framework for us in our capacity as a CFTC registrant, and eliminated many prescriptive requirements of the Commodity Exchange Act and CFTC in favor of more broad and flexible core principles. For instance, CFTC-regulated exchanges may now list new contracts and adopt new rules without prior CFTC approval under self-certification procedures, permitting timelier product launch and modification. For regulated markets, the CFMA created a three-tiered regulatory structure. The degree of regulation is related to the characteristics of the product and the type of customer that has direct or indirect access to the market, with retail customer markets being subject to greater regulation. The three-tiered regulatory structure is as follows: • designated contract markets with retail customer participation are subject to the highest level of regulation; 22 • derivatives transaction execution facilities with access limited to institutional traders and others trading through members that meet specified capital and other requirements and products limited to contracts that are less susceptible to manipulation (including single stock futures) will be subject to a lesser degree of regulation; and • exempt boards of trade subject to the least regulation are characterized by products without cash markets or that are highly unlikely to be susceptible to manipulation and by the participation only of institutional traders and others that meet specified asset requirements. Our existing market, which trades a broad range of products and permits intermediaries to represent unsophisticated customers, is subject to the most thorough oversight as a designated contract market. The CFMA permits us to organize markets that are subject to lesser regulation depending on the types of products traded and the types of traders. Markets can be organized that trade only products that are unlikely to be susceptible to manipulation and permit direct trading only among institutional participants in order to achieve a less intrusive degree of oversight. For example, in 2005, we created CME Alternative Marketplace Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of CME and an exempt board of trade registered with the CFTC for the trading of CME economic derivatives. The CFMA also provides for regulation of derivatives clearing organizations, or “DCOs,” like our clearing house, separately from the exchanges for which they clear contracts and permits DCOs to clear a range of OTC-traded products in addition to products traded on an exchange. The CFMA requires a DCO that clears for a registered futures exchange to register with the CFTC. However, our clearing house was deemed to be registered by reason of its activities prior to enactment of the CFMA. Our clearing house is required to comply with a separate set of flexible core principles that specifically apply to clearing houses. A DCO may accept for clearing any new contract or may adopt any new rule or rule amendment by providing to the CFTC a written certification that the new contract, rule or rule amendment complies with the Commodity Exchange Act. Alternatively, the DCO may request that the CFTC grant prior approval to any contract, rule or rule amendment, and the CFTC must grant approval within 75 days unless the CFTC finds that the proposed contract, rule, or rule amendment would violate the Commodity Exchange Act. CME is a self-regulatory organization responsible for ensuring market integrity and financial security for all transactions in its products. Our integrated compliance and market surveillance functions allow detailed tracking of all trading and clearing activities. In addition, our markets are subject to oversight by the CFTC. Our regulatory processes are reviewed and audited by the CFTC. Demutualization and the increasing utilization of electronic trading systems by traders from remote locations may, among other developments, impact our ability to continue the traditional form of “self-regulation” that has been an integral part of the CFTC regulatory program. On February 1, 2007, the CFTC issued recommendations as to an appropriate means for designated contract markets to comply with the core principle requiring self-regulatory organizations to mitigate potential conflicts of interest. The recommendations require at least 35% of the board of directors of a designated contract market to be directors with no material relationship with the exchange, including memberships on the exchange. If an exchange were not in compliance with this safe harbor, it would be required to demonstrate to the CFTC how it otherwise met the requirements of the core principle. Currently, 35% of our Board of Directors have no industry affiliation other than service on our Board although we have not yet completed our assessment as to whether such directors would be considered to have no material relationship with the exchange for purposes of the CFTC recommendation. The safe harbor also requires that such exchanges have in place a regulatory oversight committee comprised solely of non-industry directors. In April 2004, we became the first futures exchange to appoint a board-level committee devoted to self-regulatory oversight. The Committee is called the Market Regulation Oversight Committee and is comprised solely of independent, non-industry directors. The committee provides independent oversight of the policies and programs of our Market Regulation Department to ensure effective administration of the exchange’s self-regulatory responsibilities. From time to time it is proposed in Congress that federal financial markets regulators should be consolidated, including a possible merger between the CFTC and the SEC. While those proposals have not been adopted to date, the perceived convergence of product lines offered on the securities and commodity exchanges could make adoption more likely. To the extent the regulatory environment following such consolidation is less beneficial for us, our business, financial condition and operating results could be negatively affected. The CFTC is subject to reauthorization every five years, which was scheduled to be completed in 2005. This process is still ongoing and could result in legislation that may have a negative impact on the way we operate our exchange, including our ability to operate our self-regulatory functions or effectively compete with new entrants into our market place. From time to time it is proposed in the President’s budget that a transaction tax be imposed on futures and options on futures transactions. While those proposals have not been adopted to date, except for a per-contract fee on single stock futures and futures on narrow-based stock indexes, the imposition of any such tax could increase the cost of using our products and, consequently, our business, financial condition and operating results could be negatively affected. 23 Our Members Our members are individual traders, as well as most of the world’s largest banks, brokerages and investment houses. Trading on our open outcry trading floors is conducted exclusively by our members. Prior to the introduction of our electronic trading platform, our members traded only on our open outcry trading floors and through privately negotiated transactions. Today, our members are able to conduct trading on our open outcry trading floors, electronically on the CME Globex platform and through privately negotiated transactions that we clear. In 2006, our members were responsible for nearly 80% of our total trading volume. Members can execute trades for their own accounts, for clearing firm accounts, for the accounts of other members or for the accounts of customers of clearing firms. Members who trade for their own account, including those who lease trading rights, qualify for lower transaction fees in recognition of the market liquidity that their trading activity provides. These members also benefit from market information advantages that may accrue from their proximity to activity on the trading floors. Generally, member customers are charged lower fees than our non-member customers. There are four divisions of membership at our exchange: the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, or “CME,” division; the International Monetary Market, or “IMM,” division; the Index and Option Market, or “IOM,” division; and the Growth and Emerging Markets, or “GEM,” division. Each membership division has different trading rights. Membership applicants planning to access the trading floor are subject to a review and approval process prior to becoming members and obtaining trading rights. We have individual trading members, corporate members and clearing firms. As of December 31, 2006, there were approximately 85 clearing firms. Membership in our exchange entitles members to appear on the floor of the exchange during business hours and act as a floor broker and/or floor trader executing trades in the contracts that are eligible within their membership division. Applicants for membership on our exchange are required to be of good moral character, reputation and business integrity. They must also have adequate financial resources and credit to assume the responsibilities and privileges of membership. All members must understand the rules and regulations of our exchange and agree to abide by them. Additionally, they must comply with the provisions of the Commodity Exchange Act and the rules and regulations issued by the CFTC. Our exchange is a self-regulatory organization subject to the oversight of the CFTC. Members submit to the jurisdiction of our exchange rules. Our Market Regulation Department is the investigative and enforcement arm of our exchange with regard to our exchange rules. Members who are found to have violated a rule can be subject to sanctions such as fines, trading suspensions and/or expulsion from our exchange. Under the terms of our certificate of incorporation, our members, as Class B shareholders, have the ability to protect their rights to trade on our exchange by means of special approval rights over changes to the operation of our markets and are entitled to elect six of the 20 directors on our Board. In particular, our certificate of incorporation grants the holders of our Class B common stock the right to approve any changes to the trading floor rights, access rights and privileges that a member has, the number of memberships in each membership class and the related number of authorized shares in each class of Class B common stock and the eligibility requirements to exercise trading rights or privileges. Class B shareholders must approve any changes to these special rights. Our Shareholder Relations and Membership Services Department maintains an auction market for individual trading rights. Prospective purchasers sign and file with the department a “Bid to Purchase” form which must be guaranteed by either a clearing firm or accompanied by a certified or cashier’s check. Prospective sellers sign and file with the department an “Offer to Sell” form. The department posts bids, offers and last trade prices for the purchase of trading rights. Subsidiaries CME Alternative Marketplace Inc. CME Alternative Marketplace Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of CME, was established in September 2005 as an exempt board of trade registered with the CFTC. Currently, CME economic derivatives are the only products traded through this subsidiary. CME Alternative Marketplace accounted for less than 1% of our consolidated total revenues in 2006 and 2005. CME FX Marketplace Inc. CME FX Marketplace Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of CME Holdings, was established in May 2006 in connection with our joint venture with Reuters to form FXMarketSpace Limited. CME FX Marketplace holds a 50% interest in the joint venture. CME Global Marketplace Inc. CME Global Marketplace Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of CME, was established in November 2006 in connection with CME’s growth initiatives in Asia. 24 GFX Corporation. GFX Corporation, or “GFX,” a wholly-owned subsidiary of CME, was established in 1997 for the purpose of maintaining and creating liquidity in our electronically traded foreign exchange futures contracts. Experienced foreign exchange traders employed by GFX buy and sell our foreign exchange contracts using our CME Globex system. They limit risk from these transactions through offsetting transactions using forward contracts and spot foreign exchange transactions with approved counterparties in the interbank market. On occasion, GFX has also engaged in the trading of CME Eurodollars and equity index contracts. GFX accounted for 0.7%, 0.9% and 1.1% of our consolidated total revenues in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Swapstream Subsidiaries. In August 2006, we completed the acquisition of Swapstream, an inter-dealer electronic trading platform for euro- and Swiss franc-denominated interest rate swaps. In connection with the transaction, CME Holdings created a wholly-owned subsidiary, CME Swaps Marketplace Ltd, a U.K. limited liability company, which acquired 100% of the outstanding stock of the following Swapstream entities: Special Technology Investments Limited, Swapstream Limited, Swapstream Operating Services Limited and IT4F. In 2006, the Swapstream entities accounted for less than 1.0% of our consolidated total revenues. Our strategy is to increase the distribution and customer base for the Swapstream platform and further expand the range of products offered, including U.S. dollar-denominated interest rate swaps later in 2007. Licensing Agreements Standard & Poor’s. We have had a licensing arrangement with Standard & Poor’s Corporation since 1980. In September 2005, all of our previous licensing agreements with Standard & Poor’s were consolidated into one agreement that terminates on December 31, 2017. Under the terms of the agreement, as amended, S&P granted us a license to use certain S&P stock indexes and the related trade names, trademarks and service marks in connection with the creation, marketing, trading, clearing and promoting of futures contracts and/or options on futures contracts that are indexed to certain S&P stock indexes. The license is exclusive through December 31, 2016 and non-exclusive from that date through December 31, 2017 with some exceptions. Our license for the S&P 500 Index remains exclusive through December 31, 2008, after which we will retain our exclusive rights through December 31, 2016 so long as certain minimum average trading volume is met or other circumstances exist that relate to the reduction in trading volume. We may pay an additional fee to retain the exclusivity if the minimum average trading volume is not met. For certain products based on S&P stock indexes that we list after the effective date of the amended and restated agreement, we will have an exclusive license for two or three years depending upon the nature of the index, after which we will retain our exclusive rights so long as certain minimum average trading volumes are met. Under the agreement, we maintain our right of first refusal for new stock indexes developed by S&P during the term of the agreement. S&P also retains the right to terminate the license based on new S&P stock indexes or to terminate the exclusivity of that license in the event we fail to launch a product based on the index within a one year period, subject to some consideration for regulatory delays. In exchange for the license, we pay S&P a per trade fee. If S&P discontinues compilation and publication of any license or index, we may license, on a non-exclusive and royalty-free basis, the information regarding the list of companies, shares outstanding and divisors for that index or terminate the obligations regarding the index. The licenses become non-exclusive in the event we list certain competitive products. NASDAQ. We have had a licensing arrangement with NASDAQ since 1996 to license the NASDAQ-100 Index and related trade names, trademarks and service marks. The license was extended and expanded in October 2003 to license us both the NASDAQ-100 Index and the NASDAQ Composite Index and in April 2005 to add the NASDAQ Biotechnology Index for trading futures and options on futures contracts that are based on the indexes. The license for these indexes is exclusive through October 9, 2007 with an automatic renewal until October 9, 2012. With respect to the NASDAQ Composite Index, as of October 27, 2005 and on each subsequent anniversary, NASDAQ may terminate the exclusivity or the entire license if trading volume fails to meet certain performance criteria. During the applicable period of exclusivity, NASDAQ will not grant a license to use the indexes in connection with the trading, marketing and promotion of futures contracts and options on those futures contracts that are based on an index that is exclusive to us. We pay per trade fees to NASDAQ under the license. We have a right of first refusal for new NASDAQ indexes that are licensed for futures products where the index is substantially equivalent to an index licensed to us or is a subset of an index licensed to us. The Frank Russell Company. We have maintained a licensing arrangement with the Frank Russell Company since 1992 to license the Russell 2000 Index and related trade names, trademarks and service marks. The license was extended and expanded in 2002 to also add the Russell 1000, Russell 1000 Value and Russell 100 Growth indexes. The license for these Russell indexes is non-exclusive and automatically renews on an annual basis. In exchange for this license, we pay Russell a per trade fee. NSC. Our license agreement for the NSC software was signed with Paris Bourse SA in 1997, and it continues until 2022. The agreement was assigned by Paris Bourse SA to Euronext N.V. in 1997. Under the terms of the agreement, Euronext N.V. granted us a non-exclusive license to use the NSC software for the trading of our products and the products of certain other exchanges. In addition, we have the right to use our CME Globex trademark in conjunction with our operation of the electronic trading system based on NSC software. In consideration for the license of the NSC software, we granted Euronext N.V. a license to use and modify CLEARING 21. In December 2002, we acquired the right to offer application service provider services to third parties using the NSC software. 25 Intellectual Property We regard substantial elements of our brand name, marketing elements and logos, products, market data, software and technology as proprietary. We attempt to protect these elements by relying on trademark, service mark, copyright and trade secret laws, restrictions on disclosure and other methods. For example, with respect to trademarks, we have registered marks in more than 25 countries. We have filed numerous patent applications in the United States and internationally to protect our technology. On December 19, 2006, the United States Patent and Trademark Office granted CME its first patent. Our rights to stock indexes for our futures products principally derive from license agreements that we have obtained from Standard & Poor’s, NASDAQ and others. For a more detailed discussion of these licenses, see the section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K entitled “Item 1. Business—Licensing Agreements.” We regularly review our intellectual property to identify property that should be protected, the extent of current protection for that property and the availability of additional protection. We believe our various trademarks and service marks have been registered or applied for where needed. We also seek to protect our software and databases as trade secrets and under copyright law. We have copyright registrations for certain of our software, user manuals, and databases. Legal developments allowing patent protection for methods of doing business hold the possibility of additional protection, which we are pursuing. Patents of third parties may have an important bearing on our ability to offer certain of our products and services. It is possible that, from time to time, we may face claims of infringement that could interfere with our ability to use technology or other intellectual property that is material to our business. Employees As of December 31, 2006, we had 1,430 employees. We consider relations with our employees to be good. We have never experienced a work stoppage. We are not a party to any collective bargaining agreement. However, we employ six engineers who are associated with the International Union of Operating Engineers, Local 399, AFL-CIO. Available Information Our Web site is www.cme.com. Information made available on our Web site does not constitute part of this document.

RISK FACTORS In addition to the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating us and our business. Risks Relating to Our Business Shareholders who own trading rights or are officers or directors of firms who own trading rights on our exchange account for 12 of the 20 directors on our Board. These shareholders may have interests that differ from or conflict with those of shareholders who are not also members. Our dependence on the trading and clearing activities of our members, combined with their rights to elect directors, may enable them to exert substantial influence over the operation of our business. As of April 26, 2006, the date of our most recent Annual Meeting of Shareholders, 12 of the 20 directors on our Board owned or were officers or directors of firms who owned trading rights on our exchange. We are dependent on the revenues from the trading and clearing activities of our members. This dependence may give them substantial influence over how we operate our business. Many of our members and clearing firms derive a substantial portion of their income from their trading or clearing activities on or through our exchange. In addition, trading rights on our exchange have substantial independent value. The amount of income that members derive from their trading, brokering and clearing activities and the value of their trading rights are, in part, dependent on the fees they are charged to trade, broker, clear and access our markets and the rules and structure of our markets. Our trading members, many of whom act as floor brokers and floor traders, benefit from trading rules, membership privileges and fee discounts that enhance their open outcry trading opportunities and profits. Our predominantly electronic trading members benefit from fee discounts and other incentives targeted at increasing electronic trading volume. These benefits enhance their electronic trading opportunities and profits. Our clearing firms benefit from all of the foregoing, as well as decisions that increase electronic trading, which over time will reduce their costs of doing business on our exchange. As a result, holders of our Class A common stock may not have the same economic interests as our members. In addition, our members may have differing interests among themselves depending on the role they serve in our markets, their method of trading and the products they trade. Consequently, members may advocate that we enhance and protect their clearing and trading opportunities and the value of their trading privileges over their economic interest in us. The Board representation rights of our members, in combination with the charter provision protections described in the immediately following risk factor, could be used to influence how our business is changed or developed, including how we address competition and how we seek to grow our volume and revenue and enhance shareholder value. Our certificate of incorporation grants special rights to holders of Class B common stock, which protect their trading rights and give them special Board representation, and require that we maintain open outcry trading until volumes are not significant. Under the terms of our certificate of incorporation, our Class B shareholders have the ability to protect their rights to trade on our exchange by means of special approval rights over changes to the operation of our trading floor. In particular, these provisions include a grant to the holders of our Class B common stock of the right to approve any changes to: • the trading floor rights; • access rights and privileges that a member has; • the number of memberships in each membership class and the related number of authorized shares of each class of Class B common stock; and • the eligibility requirements to exercise trading rights or privileges. Our Class B shareholders are also entitled to elect six of the 20 directors on our Board, even if their Class A share ownership interest is very small or non-existent. Our certificate of incorporation also includes a provision requiring us to maintain open outcry floor trading on our exchange for a particular traded product as long as the open outcry market is “liquid.” Our certificate of incorporation requires us to maintain a facility for conducting business, disseminating price information, clearing and delivery and to provide reasonable financial support for technology, marketing and research for open outcry markets. Our certificate of incorporation provides specific tests as to whether an open outcry market will be deemed liquid, as measured on a quarterly basis. If a market is deemed illiquid as a result of a failure to meet any of these tests, our Board may determine whether such market should be closed. 27 Our business is subject to the impact of domestic and international market and economic conditions, which are beyond our control and which could significantly reduce our trading volumes and make our financial results more volatile. We generate revenues primarily from our clearing and transaction fees and our processing services provided to third parties. We expect to continue to do so for the foreseeable future. Each of these revenue sources is substantially dependent on the trading volume in our markets and in the markets we provide processing services. Our trading volume is directly affected by U.S. domestic and international factors that are beyond our control, including: • economic, political and market conditions; • broad trends in industry and finance; • changes in price levels and volatility in the derivatives markets and in underlying fixed-income, equity, foreign exchange and commodity markets; • legislative and regulatory changes; • competition; • changes in government monetary policies; • consolidation in our customer base and within our industry; and • inflation. Any one or more of these factors may contribute to reduced activity in our markets. Our operating results and trading volume tend to increase during periods of economic uncertainty. This is because our customers seek to hedge or manage the risks associated with or speculate on volatility in the U.S. equity markets, fluctuations in interest rates and price changes in the foreign exchange and commodity markets. The future economic environment will be subject to periodic downturns, including possible recession and lower volatility in financial markets, and may not be as favorable as it has been in recent years. As a result, period-to-period comparisons of our financial results are not necessarily meaningful. Trends less favorable than those of recent periods could result in decreased trading volume and a more difficult business environment for us. Material decreases in trading volume would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results. Our cost structure is largely fixed. If our revenues decline and we are unable to reduce our costs, our profitability will be adversely affected. Our cost structure is largely fixed. We base our cost structure on historical and expected levels of demand for our products and services. If demand for our products and services and our resulting revenues decline, we may not be able to adjust our cost structure on a timely basis. In that event, our profitability will be adversely affected. The success of our markets will depend on our ability to complete development of and successfully implement electronic trading systems that have the functionality, performance, reliability and speed required by our customers. The future success of our business depends in large part on our ability to create interactive electronic marketplaces in a wide range of derivatives products that have the required functionality, performance, reliability and speed to attract and retain customers. A significant portion of our current overall volume is generated through electronic trading on our CME Globex electronic platform. However, during 2006, 28% of our volume and approximately 21% of our clearing and transaction fees revenue was generated through our open outcry trading facilities. Most of our open outcry volume is related to trading in options on our futures contracts. Our electronic functionality may not be capable of accommodating all of the complex trading strategies typically used for trading options on futures contracts. We continue to develop and implement new electronic functionality to accommodate trading strategies required for electronic trading of Eurodollar options contracts. In August 2005, we integrated our enhanced options system for trading CME Eurodollar options into our CME Globex electronic trading platform. This enhanced functionality is designed to facilitate trading of complex combination and spread trades typically used with short-term interest rate options on futures, within a fully transparent and competitive environment. In July 2006, we also launched user-defined covered spreads. We intend to continue to introduce functionality that will accommodate other complex trading strategies electronically. However, we may not complete the development of, or successfully implement, the required electronic functionality for our options on futures contracts. Moreover, our customers who trade options may not accept our electronic trading systems. In either event, our ability to increase trading volume of options on futures contracts on the CME Globex platform would be adversely affected. In addition, if we are unable to develop our electronic trading systems to include other products and markets, or if our electronic trading systems do not have the required functionality, performance, reliability and speed, we may not be able to compete successfully in an environment that is increasingly dominated by electronic trading. 28 The enhancement of our electronic trading platform exposes us to risks inherent in operating in the evolving market for electronic transaction services. If we do not successfully enhance our electronic trading platform, or if our customers do not accept it, our revenues and profits will be adversely affected. We must continue to enhance our electronic trading platform to remain competitive. As a result, we will continue to be subject to risks, expenses and uncertainties encountered in the rapidly evolving market for electronic transaction services. These risks include our failure or inability to: • provide reliable and cost-effective services to our customers; • develop, in a timely manner, the required functionality to support electronic trading in our key products in a manner that is competitive with the functionality supported by other electronic markets; • match fees of our competitors that offer only electronic trading facilities; • attract independent software vendors to write front-end software that will effectively access our electronic trading system and automated order routing system; • respond to technological developments or service offerings by competitors; and • generate sufficient revenue to justify the substantial capital investment we have made and will continue to make to enhance our electronic trading platform. If we do not successfully enhance our electronic trading platform, or our current or potential customers do not accept it, our revenues and profits will be adversely affected. If we are not able to keep up with rapid technological changes, our business will be materially harmed. To remain competitive, we must continue to improve the responsiveness, functionality, accessibility and other features of our software, network distribution systems and technologies. The markets in which we compete are characterized by rapidly changing technology, changes in customer demand and uses of products and services, frequent product and service introductions embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards and practices that could render our existing technology and systems obsolete. Our future success will depend in part on our ability to anticipate and adapt to technological advancements and changing standards in a timely, cost-efficient and competitive manner. We cannot assure you that we will successfully implement new technologies or adapt our technology to customer and competitive requirements or emerging industry standards. We face intense competition from other companies, including some of our members. If we are not able to successfully compete, our business will not survive. The derivatives, securities and financial services industries are highly competitive. We expect that competition will continue to intensify in the future. Our current and prospective competitors, both domestically and around the world, are numerous. They include securities and securities option exchanges, futures exchanges, OTC markets, clearing organizations, market data and information vendors, electronic communications networks, crossing systems and similar entities, consortia of large customers, consortia of some of our clearing firms and electronic brokerage and dealing facilities. At December 31, 2006, there were 57 futures exchanges located in 30 countries, including nine futures exchanges in the United States. The global derivatives industry has grown increasingly competitive. Exchanges, intermediaries, and even end users are consolidating, and OTC and unregulated entities are constantly evolving. For example, in response to growing competition, many marketplaces in both Europe and the United States have demutualized to provide greater flexibility for future growth. CBOT and ICE completed their initial public offerings in 2005 and NYMEX went public in 2006. In September 2006, ICE and the NYBOT entered into a merger agreement pursuant to which NYBOT will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of ICE and ICE will obtain NYBOT’s clearing house. In December 2006, shareholders of NYSE Group and Euronext approved the merger of equal between the companies that was announced in June 2006. We believe we may also face competition from large computer software companies and media and technology companies. The number of businesses providing internet-related financial services is rapidly growing. Other companies have entered into or are forming joint ventures or consortia to provide services similar to those provided by us. Others may become competitive with us through acquisitions. Changes in federal law allow institutions that have been major participants on our exchange to trade the same or similar products among themselves without utilizing any exchange or trading system. Many of our competitors and potential competitors have greater financial, marketing, technological and personnel resources than we do. These factors may enable them to develop similar products, to provide lower transaction costs and better execution to their customers and to carry out their business strategies more quickly and efficiently than we can. In addition, our competitors may: • respond more quickly to competitive pressures due to their corporate governance structures, which may be more flexible and efficient than our corporate governance structure; 29 • develop products that are preferred by our customers; • develop risk transfer products that compete with our products; • price their products and services more competitively; • develop and expand their network infrastructure and service offerings more efficiently; • utilize better, more user-friendly and more reliable technology; • take greater advantage of acquisitions, alliances and other opportunities; • more effectively market, promote and sell their products and services; • better leverage existing relationships with customers and alliance partners or exploit better recognized brand names to market and sell their services; and • exploit regulatory disparities between traditional, regulated exchanges and alternative markets that benefit from a reduced regulatory burden and lower-cost business model. If our products, markets and services are not competitive, our business, financial condition and operating results will be materially harmed. In addition, even if new entrants do not significantly erode our market share, we may be required to reduce our fees significantly to remain competitive, which could have a material adverse effect on our profitability. Our average rate per contract is subject to fluctuation due to a number of factors. As a result, you will not be able to rely on our average rate per contract in any particular period as an indication of our future average rate per contract. Our average rate per contract, which impacts our operating results, is subject to fluctuation due to shifts in the mix of products traded, the trading venue and the mix of customers (whether the customer receives member or non-member fees or participates in one of our various incentive programs) and the impact of our tiered pricing structure. For example, we earn a higher rate per contract for trades executed on the CME Globex electronic trading platform. In addition, our members and participants in our various incentive programs generally are charged lower fees than our non-member customers. Each of these factors is difficult to predict and will have an impact on our average rate per contract in the particular period. For example, our average rate per contract decreased to $0.645 for the year ended December 31, 2006 from $0.664 for the same period in 2005. Because of this fluctuation, you may not be able to rely on our average rate per contract in any particular period as an indication of our future average rate per contract. If we fail to meet securities analysts’ expectations regarding our operating results, the price of our Class A common stock could decline substantially. Our quarterly operating results fluctuate due to seasonality. As a result, you will not be able to rely on our operating results in any particular quarter as an indication of our future performance. Generally, we have experienced relatively higher trading volume during the first and second quarters and sequentially lower trading volume in the third and fourth quarters. As a result of this seasonality, you will not be able to rely on our operating results in any particular period as an indication of our future performance. If we fail to meet securities analysts’ expectations regarding our operating results, the price of our Class A common stock could decline substantially. The CFMA has reduced the barriers of entry into our markets which has led to increased competition and enabled many of our customers to trade futures contracts other than on exchanges. These changes may adversely affect our trading volume, revenue and profits. Our industry has been subject to several fundamental regulatory changes, including changes in the statute under which we have operated since 1974. The Commodity Exchange Act generally required all futures contracts to be executed on an exchange that had been approved by the CFTC. The “exchange trading requirement” was modified by CFTC regulations and interpretations to permit privately negotiated swap contracts to be transacted in the OTC market. The CFTC exemption under which the OTC derivatives market operated precluded the OTC market from using exchange-like electronic transaction systems and clearing facilities. These barriers to competition from the OTC market were repealed by the CFMA. One of the chief beneficiaries of the CFMA has been OTC dealers and competitors that operate or intend to open electronic trading facilities or to conduct their futures business directly among themselves on a bilateral basis. The customers who may access these trading facilities or engage in bilateral private transactions are the same customers who account for a substantial portion of our trading volume. The CFMA also permits banks, broker-dealers and some of their affiliates to engage in foreign exchange futures transactions for or with retail customers without being subject to regulation under the Commodity Exchange Act. These customers are the same customers who might otherwise use CME foreign exchange products. In the future, our industry may become subject to new regulations or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing regulations. We cannot predict the extent to which any future regulatory changes may adversely impact our business, including our ability to compete with enterprises, which offer off-exchange trading and which benefit from a reduced regulatory burden and lower-cost business model. 30 The CFMA also permits bank clearing organizations and clearing organizations regulated by the SEC to clear a broad array of derivatives products in addition to the products that these clearing organizations have traditionally cleared. This allocation of jurisdiction may be advantageous to competing clearing organizations and result in a lower volume of trading cleared through our clearing house. Our trading volume, and consequently our revenues and profits, would be adversely affected if we are unable to retain our current customers or attract new customers to our exchange. The success of our business depends, in part, on our ability to maintain and increase our trading volume. To do so, we must maintain and expand our product offerings, our customer base and our trade execution alternatives. Our success also depends on our ability to maintain our trading volume and to offer competitive prices and services in an increasingly price sensitive business. We cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to expand our product lines, or that we will be able to retain our current customers or attract new customers. For example, the majority of the clearing and transaction fees we receive from our clearing firms represent charges for trades executed on behalf of their customers. We believe that in the event one of our clearing firms discontinues operations, the customer portion of that firm’s trading activity would likely transfer to another clearing firm. However, we cannot guarantee you that the discontinuation of any clearing firm would not result in our loss of customers which could have an adverse effect on our trading volumes or revenues. We also cannot assure you that we will not lose customers to low-cost competitors with comparable or superior products, services or trade execution facilities. If we fail to maintain our trading volume, to expand our product offerings or execution facilities, or we lose a substantial number of our current customers, or are unable to attract new customers, our business will be adversely affected. Any significant decline in the trading volume of our CME Eurodollar or S&P 500 futures and options on futures contracts would adversely affect our revenues and profitability. We are substantially dependent on trading volume from two product offerings for a significant portion of our clearing and transaction fee revenues and profits. The clearing and transaction fees revenue attributable to transactions in CME Eurodollar contracts and all our contracts based on the S&P 500 (including CME E-mini products) approximated 46% and 26%, respectively, of our total clearing and transaction fees revenue during the year ended December 31, 2006 and 44% and 25%, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2005. Any significant decline in our trading volume in any of these products would negatively impact our business, financial condition and operating results. We believe our CME Eurodollar futures contract serves as a global financial benchmark, but we cannot assure you that, in the future, other products will not become preferred alternatives to our CME Eurodollar contract as a means of managing or speculating on interest rate risk. We also cannot assure you that competitors will not enter the Eurodollar market. For example, in March 2004, Euronext.liffe began listing and trading Eurodollar futures contracts. Our members may also elect to trade Eurodollars in privately negotiated bilateral transactions without the use of our clearing house. In either of these events, our trading volume, revenues and profitability could be adversely affected. Our license agreement with Standard & Poor’s provides that the S&P 500 Index futures products will be exclusive through December 31, 2008, after which we will retain our exclusive rights through December 31, 2016 so long as certain minimum average trading volume is met or other circumstances exist that relate to the reduction in trading volume. We cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain the exclusivity of our licensing agreement with S&P. In addition, we cannot assure you that others will not succeed in creating stock index futures based on information similar to that which we have obtained by license or that market participants will not increasingly use other instruments, including securities and options based on the S&P indexes, to manage or speculate on U.S. stock risks. Parties may also succeed in offering indexed products that are similar to our licensed products without being required to obtain a license or in countries that are beyond the jurisdictional reach of us and/or our licensors. Our clearing house operations expose us to substantial credit risk of third parties. Our financial condition will be adversely affected in the event of a significant default. Our clearing house acts as the counterparty to all trades consummated on or through our exchange or on third-party exchanges for which we provide processing services. As a result, we are exposed to significant credit risk of third parties, including our clearing firms. We are also exposed, indirectly, to the credit risk of customers of our clearing firms. These parties may default on their obligations due to bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, operational failure or other reasons. We cannot guarantee you that one of our clearing 31 firms will not default on its obligations in the future. A substantial part of our surplus funds is at risk if a clearing firm defaults on its obligations to our clearing house and its performance bond and security deposits are insufficient to meet its obligations. Although we have policies and procedures to help ensure that our clearing firms can satisfy their obligations, these policies and procedures may not succeed in detecting problems or preventing defaults. We also have in place various measures intended to enable us to cover any default and maintain liquidity. However, we cannot assure you that these measures will be sufficient to protect us from a default or that we will not be materially and adversely affected in the event of a significant default. Additionally, the default of any one of our clearing firms could cause our customers to lose confidence in our markets and the guarantee of our clearing house, which would have an adverse affect on our business. We generate significant revenue by providing processing services to third parties. If we are unable to continue to realize the benefits of these agreements, our revenues will be adversely impacted. We have entered into agreements with third parties to provide processing services for which we receive significant revenue. We have an agreement with CBOT to provide processing services for its futures and options on futures contracts. The initial term of the CBOT agreement expires in January 2009. Upon expiration, CBOT may, in its sole discretion, extend the agreement for an additional one-year term. We also entered into an agreement with NYMEX in April 2006 to be the exclusive electronic trading service provider for NYMEX’s energy futures and options contracts and certain of their other products on our CME Globex platform. The initial term of the NYMEX agreement is for ten years from the date of launch with rolling three-year extensions. In 2006, 2005 and 2004, we generated $90.1 million, $68.7 million and $55.9 million, respectively, in processing services revenue primarily from our agreement with CBOT. Our future revenues from providing these processing services will be dependent on CBOT’s trading volume and NYMEX’s electronic trading volume, which is subject to a number of factors beyond their control. As futures exchanges, their ability to maintain or expand their trading volume and operate their business is subject to the same types of risks to which we are subject. Any significant decrease in CBOT’s and/or NYMEX’s trading volume will result in a corresponding decrease in our realized benefits from our processing services agreements. Our net income from the processing services we provide will also depend on our ability to control our costs associated with providing such services. The terms of our processing agreements also provide that both we and the other party may terminate the agreement in some circumstances. Under the terms of our agreement with NYMEX, either party between the fifth and sixth anniversary of the first launch date may terminate the contract by providing notice and paying the other party a termination fee. We cannot assure you that these agreements will not be terminated prior to the end of their term or that the agreements will be renewed after their initial term or that any renewal will be on terms as favorable to us. Any such event could have an adverse effect on our revenues. Our market data fees may be reduced or eliminated by the growth of electronic trading and electronic order entry systems. If we are unable to offset that reduction through terminal usage fees or transaction fees, we will experience a reduction in revenue. We sell our market data to individuals and organizations that use our markets or monitor general economic conditions. Revenues from our market data totaled $80.8 million, representing 7% of our total revenues, and $71.7 million, or 8% of our total revenues, during the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Electronic trading systems do not usually impose separate charges for supplying market data to trading terminals. If we do not separately charge for market data supplied to trading terminals, and trading terminals with access to our markets become widely available, we could lose market data fees from those who have access to trading terminals. We will experience a reduction in our revenues if we are unable to recover that lost quote fee revenue through terminal usage fees or transaction fees. If we experience systems failures or capacity constraints, our ability to conduct our operations and execute our business strategy could be materially harmed and we could be subjected to significant costs and liabilities. We are heavily dependent on the capacity and reliability of the computer and communications systems and software supporting our operations. We receive and/or process a large portion of our trade orders through electronic means, such as through public and private communications networks. Our systems, or those of our third party providers, may fail or operate slowly, causing one or more of the following to occur: • unanticipated disruptions in service to our customers; • slower response times; • delays in our customers’ trade execution; • failed settlement of trades; • incomplete or inaccurate accounting, recording or processing of trades; • financial losses; • security breaches; 32 • litigation or other customer claims; • loss of customers; and • regulatory sanctions. We cannot assure you that we will not experience systems failures from power or telecommunications failure, acts of God, war or terrorism, human error, natural disasters, fire, sabotage, hardware or software malfunctions or defects, computer viruses, acts of vandalism or similar events. If any of our systems do not operate properly or are disabled, including as a result of system failure, employee or customer error or misuse of our systems, we could suffer financial loss, liability to customers, regulatory intervention or reputational damage that could affect demand by current and potential users of our market. From time to time, we have experienced system errors and failures that have resulted in some customers being unable to connect to our electronic trading platform or erroneous reporting, such as transactions that were not authorized by any customer or reporting of filled orders as cancelled. For example, we have experienced technical failures that resulted in a temporary suspension of trading on the CME Globex platform, including our most recent incident on April 26, 2005. The impact of these events has not been material. However, we cannot assure you that if we experience system errors or failures in the future that they will not be material. Our status as a CFTC registrant generally requires that our trade execution and communications systems be able to handle anticipated present and future peak trading volume. Heavy use of our computer systems during peak trading times or at times of unusual market volatility could cause our systems to operate slowly or even to fail for periods of time. We constantly monitor system loads and performance and regularly implement system upgrades to handle estimated increases in trading volume. However, we cannot assure you that our estimates of future trading volume and order messaging traffic will be accurate or that our systems will always be able to accommodate actual trading volume and order messaging traffic without failure or degradation of performance. Increased CME Globex trading volume and order messaging traffic may result in connectivity problems or erroneous reports that may affect users of the platform. System failure or degradation could lead our customers to file formal complaints with industry regulatory organizations, to file lawsuits against us or to cease doing business with us or could lead the CFTC or other regulators to initiate inquiries or proceedings for failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations. We will need to continue to upgrade, expand and increase the capacity of our systems as our business grows and we execute our business strategy. Our goal is to design our systems to handle at least one and a half times our peak historical transactions in our highest volume products. As volume of transactions grow, the ability of our systems to meet this goal on an ongoing basis depends on our ability to increase our system capacity on a timely basis while maintaining system reliability. Although many of our systems are designed to accommodate additional volume and products and services without redesign or replacement, we will need to continue to make significant investments in additional hardware and software to accommodate the increases in volume of transactions and order transaction traffic and to provide processing services to third parties. If we cannot increase the capacity and capabilities of our systems to accommodate an increasing volume of transactions and to execute our business strategy, our ability to maintain or expand our businesses would be adversely affected. Some of our largest clearing firms have indicated their belief that clearing facilities should not be owned or controlled by exchanges and should be operated as utilities and not–for–profit. These clearing firms have sought, and may seek in the future, legislative or regulatory changes that would, if adopted, enable them to use alternative clearing services for positions established on our exchange. Even if they are not successful, these factors may cause them to limit or stop the use of our markets. Some of our largest clearing firms, which are significant customers and intermediaries in our products, have stressed the importance to them of centralizing clearing of futures contracts and options on futures contracts in order to maximize the efficient use of their capital, exercise greater control over their value at risk and extract greater operating leverage from clearing activities. Many clearing firms have expressed the view that clearing firms should control the governance of clearing houses or that clearing houses should be operated as utilities rather than as for-profit enterprises. Some of these firms, along with the Futures Industry Association, have sought, and may seek in the future, legislative or regulatory changes to be adopted that would facilitate mechanisms or policies that allow market participants to transfer positions from an exchange-owned clearing house to a clearing house owned and controlled by clearing firms. Our strategic business plan is to operate a vertically integrated transaction execution, clearing and settlement business. If these legislative or regulatory changes are adopted, our strategy and business plan may lead clearing firms to establish, or seek to use, alternative clearing houses for clearing positions established on our exchange. Even if they are not successful in their efforts, the factors described above may cause clearing firms to limit or stop the use of our products and markets. If any of these events occur, our revenues and profits would be adversely affected. 33 We depend on third party suppliers and service providers for a number of services that are important to our business. An interruption or cessation of an important supply or service by any third party could have a material adverse effect on our business. We depend on a number of suppliers, such as banking, clearing and settlement organizations, telephone companies, online service providers, data processors, and software and hardware vendors for elements of our trading, clearing and other systems, as well as communications and networking equipment, computer hardware and software and related support and maintenance. We cannot assure you that any of these providers will be able to continue to provide these services in an efficient, cost-effective manner or that they will be able to adequately expand their services to meet our needs. An interruption in or the cessation of an important supply or service by any third party and our inability to make alternative arrangements in a timely manner, or at all, would result in lost revenue and higher costs. Our networks and those of our third party service providers may be vulnerable to security risks, which could result in wrongful use of our information or cause interruptions in our operations that cause us to lose customers and trading volume and result in significant liabilities. We could also be required to incur significant expense to protect our systems. We expect the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks to continue to be a critical element of our operations. Our networks and those of our third party service providers and our customers may be vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer viruses and other security problems. Persons who circumvent security measures could wrongfully use our information or cause interruptions or malfunctions in our operations. Any of these events could cause us to lose customers or trading volume. We may be required to expend significant resources to protect against the threat of security breaches or to alleviate problems, including reputational harm and litigation, caused by breaches. Although we intend to continue to implement industry-standard security measures, these measures may prove to be inadequate and result in system failures and delays that could cause us to lose customers, experience lower trading volume and incur significant liabilities. We operate in a heavily regulated environment that imposes significant costs and competitive burdens on our business. Although the CFMA significantly reduced our regulatory burdens, we remain extensively regulated by the CFTC. Our international operations may be subject to similar regulations in specific jurisdictions. We are registered in a number of countries outside the United States. In some cases, our registrations are subject to annual review and such reviews may subject us to additional requirements in the future. We may also be required to register or become subject to regulation in other jurisdictions in order to accept business from customers in those jurisdictions. Many aspects of our operations are subject to oversight and regulation by the CFTC. Our activities relating to single stock and narrow-based stock index futures products are also subject to oversight by the SEC. Our operations are subject to ongoing review and oversight, including: • the security and soundness of our order routing and trading systems; • record keeping and record retention procedures; • maintaining a fair and orderly market; • the licensing of our members and many of their employees; and • the conduct of our directors, officers, employees and affiliates. If we fail to comply with applicable laws, rules or regulations, we may be subject to censure, fines, cease-and-desist orders, suspension of our business, removal of personnel or other sanctions, including revocation of our designations as a contract market and derivatives clearing organization. Changes in laws, regulations or governmental policies could have a material adverse effect on the way we conduct our business. The CFTC has broad powers to investigate and enforce compliance and punish non-compliance with its rules and regulations. We cannot assure you that we and/or our directors, officers, employees and affiliates will be able to fully comply with these rules and regulations. We also cannot assure you that we will not be subject to claims or actions by the CFTC or other agencies. Demutualization and the increasing utilization of electronic trading systems by traders from remote locations may, among other developments, impact our ability to continue the traditional form of “self-regulation” that has been an integral part of the CFTC regulatory program. On February 1, 2007, the CFTC issued recommendations as to an appropriate means for designated contract markets to comply with the core principle requiring self-regulatory organizations to mitigate potential conflicts of interest. The recommendations require at least 35% of the board of directors of a designated contract market to be directors with no material relationship with the exchange, including memberships on the exchange. Currently, 35% of our Board of Directors have no industry affiliation other than service on our Board although we have not yet completed our assessment as to whether such directors would be considered to have no material relationship with the exchange for purposes of the CFTC recommendation. We cannot guarantee that our Board will be in compliance with the recommendations. To the extent we are not in compliance, we will be required to demonstrate to the CFTC how we otherwise met the requirements of the core principle. 34 From time to time, it is proposed in Congress that federal financial markets regulators should be consolidated, including a possible merger between the CFTC and the SEC. While those proposals have not been adopted to date, the perceived convergence of product lines offered on the securities and commodity exchanges could make adoption more likely. To the extent the regulatory environment following such consolidation is less beneficial for us, our business could be negatively affected. The CFTC is subject to reauthorization every five years, which was scheduled to be completed in 2005. This process is still ongoing and could result in legislation that may have a negative impact on the way we operate our exchange, including our ability to operate our self-regulatory functions or effectively compete with new entrants into our market place. From time to time, the President’s budget includes a proposal that a transaction tax be imposed on futures and options on futures transactions. While those proposals have not been adopted to date, except for a per-contract fee imposed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on single stock futures and futures on narrow-based stock indexes, the imposition of any such tax would increase the cost of using our products and, consequently, could adversely impact our trading volumes, revenues and profits. Our compliance and risk management methods might not be effective and may result in outcomes that could adversely affect our reputation, financial condition and operating results. Generally, the CFTC has broad enforcement powers to censure, fine, issue cease-and-desist orders, prohibit us from engaging in some of our businesses or suspend or revoke our designation as a contract market or the registration of any of our officers or employees who violate applicable laws or regulations. Our ability to comply with applicable laws and rules is largely dependent on our establishment and maintenance of compliance, audit and reporting systems, as well as our ability to attract and retain qualified compliance and other risk management personnel. We face the risk of significant intervention by regulatory authorities, including extensive examination and surveillance activity. In the case of non-compliance or alleged non-compliance with applicable laws or regulations, we could be subject to investigations and judicial or administrative proceedings that may result in substantial penalties or civil lawsuits, including by customers, for damages, which can be significant. Any of these outcomes would adversely affect our reputation, financial condition and operating results. In extreme cases, these outcomes could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business. Our policies and procedures to identify, monitor and manage our risks may not be fully effective. Some of our risk management methods depend upon evaluation of information regarding markets, customers or other matters that are publicly available or otherwise accessible by us. That information may not in all cases be accurate, complete, up-to-date or properly evaluated. Management of operational, legal and regulatory risk requires, among other things, policies and procedures to record properly and verify a large number of transactions and events. We cannot assure you that our policies and procedures will always be effective or that we will always be successful in monitoring or evaluating the risks to which we are or may be exposed. As a financial services provider, we are subject to significant litigation risk and potential securities law liability. Many aspects of our business involve substantial liability risks. While we enjoy governmental immunity for some of our market-related activities, we could be exposed to substantial liability under federal and state laws and court decisions, as well as rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC and the CFTC. These risks include, among others, potential liability from disputes over terms of a trade, the claim that a system failure or delay caused monetary losses to a customer, that we entered into an unauthorized transaction or that we provided materially false or misleading statements in connection with a transaction. Dissatisfied customers frequently make claims regarding quality of trade execution, improperly settled trades, mismanagement or even fraud against their service providers. We may become subject to these claims as a result of failures or malfunctions of our systems and services we provide. We could incur significant legal expenses defending claims, even those without merit. In addition, an adverse resolution of any future lawsuit or claim against us could have a material adverse effect on our business. We could be harmed by employee misconduct or errors that are difficult to detect and deter. There have been a number of highly publicized cases involving fraud or other misconduct by employees of financial services firms in recent years. Misconduct by our employees, including employees of GFX Corporation, our wholly-owned subsidiary that primarily engages in proprietary trading in foreign exchange futures, could include hiding unauthorized activities from us, improper or unauthorized activities on behalf of CME customers or improper use of confidential information. Employee misconduct could subject us to financial losses or regulatory sanctions and seriously harm our reputation. It is not always possible to deter employee misconduct, and the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases. Our employees also may commit errors that could subject us to financial claims for negligence, as well as regulatory actions. For example, 35 employees of GFX Corporation enter into transactions to promote liquidity in CME foreign exchange contracts on the CME Globex platform and subsequently enter into offsetting transactions using futures contracts or spot foreign exchange transactions with approved counterparties in the interbank market to limit market risk. In the event the offsetting transaction is not entered into or is not timely or properly executed, we could be exposed to substantial market risk. We may have difficulty executing our growth strategy and maintaining our growth effectively. We have experienced significant growth in our business. Continued growth may require additional investment in personnel, facilities, information technology infrastructure and financial and management systems and controls and may place a significant strain on our management and resources. We may not be successful in implementing all of the processes that are necessary to support our growth organically or as described in the following risk factor through acquisitions or other strategic alliances. Unless our growth results in an increase in our revenues that is proportionate to the increase in our costs associated with our growth, our future profitability could be adversely affected, and we may have to incur significant expenditures to address the additional operational and control requirements as a result of our growth. Our acquisition, investment and alliance strategy involves risks. If we are unable to effectively manage these risks, our business will be materially harmed. To achieve our strategic objectives, in the future we may seek to acquire or invest in other companies, businesses or technologies. Acquisitions entail numerous risks, including the following: • difficulties in the assimilation of acquired businesses or technologies; • diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns; • assumption of unknown material liabilities; • difficulties in implementing adequate compliance and risk management methods for new operations; • failure to achieve financial or operating objectives; and • potential loss of customers or key employees of acquired companies. We may not be able to integrate successfully any operations, personnel, services or products that we have acquired or may acquire in the future. See “Additional Risks Relating to the Proposed Merger with CBOT Holdings” for additional risks. We also may seek to expand or enhance some of our operations by forming joint ventures or alliances with various strategic partners throughout the world. Entering into joint ventures and alliances also entails risks, including difficulties in developing and expanding the business of newly formed joint ventures, exercising influence over the activities of joint ventures in which we do not have a controlling interest, and potential conflicts with our joint venture or alliance partners. We cannot assure you that any joint venture or alliance that we have entered into or may enter into in the future, will be successful. The imposition in the future of regulations requiring that clearing houses establish linkages with other clearing houses whereby positions at one clearing house can be transferred to and maintained at, or otherwise offset by a fungible position existing at, another clearing house may have a material adverse effect on the operation of our business. In connection with the trading of single stock futures and futures on narrow-based stock indexes, the CFMA contemplates that clearing houses will, after an initial period, establish linkages enabling a position in any such product executed on an exchange for which it clears these products to be offset by an economically linked or fungible position on the opposite side of the market that is executed on another exchange utilizing a different clearing house. If, in the future, a similar requirement is imposed with respect to futures contracts generally, the resulting unbundling of trade execution and clearing services would have a material adverse effect on our revenues and profits. Expansion of our operations internationally involves special challenges that we may not be able to meet, which could adversely affect our financial results. We plan to continue to expand our operations internationally, including by directly placing order entry terminals with customers outside the United States and by relying on distribution systems established by our current and future strategic alliance partners. We currently have direct customer access in more than 70 countries. We face certain risks inherent in doing business in international markets, particularly in the regulated derivatives exchange business. These risks include: • restrictions on the use of trading terminals or the contracts that may be traded; • becoming subject to extensive regulations and oversight, tariffs and other trade barriers; 36 • difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations; • general economic and political conditions in the countries from which our markets are accessed, which may have an adverse effect on our volume from those countries; and • potentially adverse tax consequences. In addition, as a result of our expanding global operations, we may become subject to the laws and regulations of foreign governmental and regulatory authorities. These may include laws, rules and regulations relating to any aspect of the derivatives business. To date, we have had limited experience in marketing and operating our products and services internationally. We cannot assure you that we will be able to succeed in marketing our products and services in international markets. We may also experience difficulty in managing our international operations because of, among other things, competitive conditions overseas, management of foreign exchange risk, established domestic markets, language and cultural differences and economic or political instability. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on the success of our international operations and, consequently, on our business, financial condition and operating results. We may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights, which may materially harm our business. We rely primarily on trade secret, copyright, service mark, trademark and patent law and contractual protections to protect our proprietary technology and other proprietary rights. We have filed several patent applications covering our technology in the United States and certain other jurisdictions. Notwithstanding the precautions we take to protect our intellectual property rights, it is possible that third parties may copy or otherwise obtain and use our proprietary technology without authorization or otherwise infringe on our rights. We also seek to protect our software and databases as trade secrets and under copyright law. We have copyright registrations for certain of our software, user manuals and databases. The copyright protection afforded to databases, however, is fairly limited. While the arrangement and selection of data generally are protectable, the actual data may not be, and others may be free to create databases that would perform the same function. In some cases, including a number of our most important products, there may be no effective legal recourse against duplication by competitors. In addition, in the future, we may have to rely on litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights, protect our trade secrets, determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or defend against claims of infringement or invalidity. Any such litigation, whether successful or unsuccessful, could result in substantial costs to us and diversions of our resources, either of which could adversely affect our business. Any infringement by us on patent rights of others could result in litigation and adversely affect our ability to continue to provide, or increase the cost of providing, our products and electronic execution services. Patents of third parties may have an important bearing on our ability to offer certain of our products and services. Our competitors as well as other companies and individuals may obtain, and may be expected to obtain in the future, patents related to the types of products and services we offer or plan to offer. We cannot assure you that we are or will be aware of all patents containing claims that may pose a risk of infringement by our products and services. In addition, some patent applications in the United States are confidential until a patent is issued and, therefore, we cannot evaluate the extent to which our products and services may be covered or asserted to be covered by claims contained in pending patent applications. These claims of infringement are not uncommon in our industry. In general, if one or more of our products or services were to infringe on patents held by others, we may be required to stop developing or marketing the products or services, to obtain licenses to develop and market the services from the holders of the patents or to redesign the products or services in such a way as to avoid infringing on the patent claims. We cannot assess the extent to which we may be required in the future to obtain licenses with respect to patents held by others, whether such licenses would be available or, if available, whether we would be able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms. If we were unable to obtain such licenses, we may not be able to redesign our products or services to avoid infringement, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. We may be at greater risk from terrorism than other companies. Given our position as the largest futures exchange in the United States, as measured by annual trading volume, we may be more likely than other companies to be a direct target of, or an indirect casualty of, attacks by terrorists or terrorist organizations. It is impossible to predict the likelihood or impact of any terrorist attack on the derivatives industry generally or on our business. In the event of an attack or a threat of an attack, our security measures and contingency plans may be inadequate to prevent significant disruptions in our business, technology or access to the infrastructure necessary to maintain our business. Damage to our facilities due to terrorist attacks may be significantly in excess of any amount of insurance received, or we may not be able to insure against such damage at a reasonable price or at all. The threat of terrorist attacks may also negatively affect our ability to attract and retain employees. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. 37 Additional Risks Relating to the Proposed Merger with CBOT Holdings We may fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits of the proposed merger with CBOT Holdings. The success of the merger will depend, in part, on our ability to achieve the anticipated cost synergies and other strategic benefits from combining the businesses of CME Holdings and CBOT Holdings. We expect CME Group to benefit from operational synergies resulting from the consolidation of capabilities and elimination of redundancies as well as greater efficiencies from increased scale, market integration and more automation. However, to realize these anticipated benefits, we must successfully combine the businesses of CME Holdings and CBOT Holdings. If we are not able to achieve these objectives, the anticipated cost synergies and other strategic benefits of the merger may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected. We may fail to realize some or all of the anticipated benefits of the transaction in the amounts and times projected for a number of reasons, including that the integration may take longer than anticipated, be more costly than anticipated or have unanticipated adverse results relating to CME Holdings’ or CBOT Holdings’ existing businesses. The failure to integrate successfully the businesses and operations of CME Holdings and CBOT Holdings in the expected time frame may adversely affect CME Group’s future results. Historically, CME Holdings and CBOT Holdings have operated as independent companies, and they will continue to do so until the completion of the merger. The management of CME Group may face significant challenges in consolidating the functions of CME Holdings and CBOT Holdings and their subsidiaries, integrating their technologies, organizations, procedures, policies and operations, as well as addressing differences in the business cultures of the two companies and retaining key personnel. In connection with the merger, CME Group expects to integrate certain operations of CME and CBOT, including consolidating the two trading floors, transitioning CBOT’s electronic trading to CME’s Globex platform, consolidating their market data services and consolidating regulatory functions. The integration will be complex and time consuming, and require substantial resources and effort. The integration process and other disruptions resulting from the merger may also disrupt each company’s ongoing businesses or cause inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that adversely affect our relationships with members of CME and CBOT and other market participants, employees, regulators and others with whom we have business or other dealings. In addition, difficulties in integrating the businesses or regulatory functions of CME Holdings and CBOT Holdings could harm the reputation of CME Group. CME Holdings and CBOT Holdings will incur transaction, integration and restructuring costs in connection with the merger. CME Holdings and CBOT Holdings expect to incur significant costs associated with transaction fees, professional services and other costs related to the merger. Specifically, CME Holdings and CBOT Holdings expect to incur approximately $62 million for transaction costs related to the merger. CME Group also will incur integration and restructuring costs following the completion of the merger as CME Group integrates the business of CBOT Holdings with that of CME Holdings. Although CME Holdings and CBOT Holdings expect that the realization of efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses will offset incremental transaction, merger-related and restructuring costs over time, this net benefit may not be achieved in the near term, or at all. Completion of the merger is subject to the receipt of consents and approvals from, or the making of filings with, government entities that could delay completion of the merger or impose conditions that could have a material adverse effect on CME Group or that could cause abandonment of the merger. The merger is subject to review under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, by either the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice or the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. Under this statute, CME Holdings and CBOT Holdings are required to make pre-merger notification filings and to await the expiration of the statutory waiting period prior to completing the merger. On December 1, 2006, CME Holdings and CBOT Holdings each received requests for additional information, or a “Second Request,” regarding the merger from the Department of Justice. The Second Request extends the initial waiting period under the statute during which the Department of Justice is permitted to review a proposed transaction until 30 days after the parties have substantially complied with the Second Request, unless that period is terminated earlier by the Department of Justice or, if the Department of Justice objects to the merger, it obtains an injunction from a court. 38 We cannot assure you that a challenge to the merger on antitrust grounds will not be made or, if such a challenge is made, that any such challenge will not be successful. Any such challenge may seek to impose a preliminary or permanent injunction, conditions on the completion of the merger or require changes to the terms of the merger. While we do not currently expect that any such preliminary or permanent injunction, conditions or changes would be imposed, we cannot assure you that they will not be, and such conditions or changes could have the effect of delaying completion of the merger or imposing additional costs on us or limiting the revenues of CME Group following the merger, any of which might have a material adverse effect on CME Group following the merger. Neither CME Holdings nor CBOT Holdings is obligated to complete the merger if any such conditions, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to result in (i) a material adverse effect on the expected benefits of the merger or (ii) a material adverse effect on CME Holdings, CBOT Holdings or CME Group following the merger. CME Holdings may incur significant indebtedness in order to finance the merger, which may limit CME Group’s operating flexibility. In order to finance the cash portion of the merger consideration, CME Holdings expects to incur incremental borrowings of up to $2.0 billion, depending on the elections made by CBOT Holdings Class A stockholders with respect to the merger consideration. We have not obtained any commitments for the financing. As of September 30, 2006, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the merger, assuming that CME Holdings pays the maximum amount of cash available to CBOT Holdings Class A stockholders of $3.0 billion, CME Group would have had $2.0 billion in indebtedness outstanding. This level of indebtedness may: • require CME Group to dedicate a significant portion of its cash flow from operations to payments on its debt, thereby reducing the availability of cash flow to fund capital expenditures, to pursue other acquisitions or investments in new technologies, to pay dividends and for general corporate purposes; • increase CME Group’s vulnerability to general adverse economic conditions, including increases in interest rates if the borrowings bear interest at variable rates; and • limit CME Group’s flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in or challenges relating to its business and industry. In addition, to the extent that the credit ratings of CME Group are below ratings we would have been able to obtain as a stand-alone company, borrowing costs may increase, and to the extent that the credit ratings are below investment grade, the terms of the financing obligations could include restrictions, such as affirmative and negative covenants, conditions to borrowing, subsidiary guarantees and stock pledges. A failure to comply with these restrictions could result in a default under the financing obligations or could require CME Group to obtain waivers from its lenders for failure to comply with these restrictions. The occurrence of a default that remains uncured or the inability to secure a necessary consent or waiver could have a material adverse effect on CME Group’s business, financial condition or results of operations. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS Not applicable. ITEM 2. PROPERTIES Our trading facilities and corporate headquarters are located at 20 South Wacker Drive in Chicago, Illinois. As of December 31, 2006, we occupied approximately 450,000 square feet of office space pursuant to a lease that expires in 2008 at our corporate headquarters. We also occupy approximately 70,000 square feet of trading floor space under a lease with the CME Trust with a term that expires in 2009. We have an option to extend the term of the lease to 2012 with an option for two successive seven-year extensions through 2019 and 2026. In 2006, we leased additional office space at 550 West Washington for approximately 220,000 square feet of office space on a phased-in basis through 2011 pursuant to a lease that expires in 2023. As of December 31, 2006, we maintained backup facilities for our electronic systems in separate office towers at 10 and 30 South Wacker Drive, and we have two remote data centers. We also lease administrative office space in Washington, D.C., Tokyo, Japan, Hong Kong, China and Sydney, Australia and both administrative and communication equipment space in London, England. We believe our facilities are adequate for our current operations and that additional space can be obtained if needed. 39 ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS From time to time, we are involved in legal proceedings and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we are not a party to or, to our knowledge, threatened with any litigation or other legal proceeding that, in our opinion, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition. On October 14, 2003, the U.S. Futures Exchange, L.L.C., or “Eurex U.S.,” and U.S. Exchange Holdings, Inc., filed suit against CBOT and CME in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. The suit alleges that CBOT and CME violated the antitrust laws and tortiously interfered with the business relationship and contract between Eurex U.S. and The Clearing Corporation. Eurex U.S. and U.S. Exchange Holdings, Inc. are seeking a preliminary injunction and treble damages. On December 12, 2003, CBOT and CME filed separate motions to dismiss or, in the event the motion to dismiss is denied, to move the venue to the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. On September 2, 2004, the judge granted CBOT’s and CME’s motion to transfer venue to the Northern District of Illinois. In light of that decision, the judge did not rule on the motions to dismiss. On March 25, 2005, Eurex U.S. filed a second amended complaint in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. On June 6, 2005, CME and CBOT filed a motion to dismiss the complaint. On August 25, 2005, the judge denied the joint CME/CBOT motion to dismiss. The parties are currently engaged in discovery. Based on its investigation to date and advice from legal counsel, we believe this suit is without merit and we intend to vigorously defend against these charges. ITEM 4. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS Not applicable. PART II ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES Class A Common Stock Our Class A common stock is listed on the NYSE and the NASDAQ Global Select Market Inc. under the ticker symbol “CME.” As of February 15, 2007, there were 516 holders of record of our Class A common stock. The following table sets forth the high and low sales prices per share of our Class A common stock on a quarterly basis, as reported on the NYSE. 2006 High Low 2005 High Low First Quarter $ 457.50 $ 354.51 First Quarter $ 229.50 $ 183.50 Second Quarter 503.94 417.90 Second Quarter 307.75 163.80 Third Quarter 508.78 425.79 Third Quarter 340.00 264.13 Fourth Quarter 557.97 464.70 Fourth Quarter 396.90 287.05 Class B Common Stock Our Class B common stock is not listed on a national securities exchange or traded in an organized OTC market. Each class of our Class B common stock is associated with a membership in a specific division of our exchange. CME’s rules provide exchange members with trading rights and the ability to use or lease these trading rights. Each share of our Class B common stock can be transferred only in connection with the transfer of the associated trading rights. The memberships by class are CME (Chicago Mercantile Exchange), IMM (International Monetary Market), IOM (Index and Option Market) and GEM (Growth and Emerging Markets). Class B shares and the associated trading rights are bought and sold through our Shareholder Relations and Membership Services Department. In addition, trading rights may be leased through the department. Trading rights sales are reported on our Web site at www.cme.com. Although our Class B shareholders have special voting rights, because our Class B shares have the same equitable interest in our earnings and the same dividend payments as our Class A shares, we expect that the market price of our Class B common stock, if reported separately from the associated trading rights, would be determined by the value of our Class A common stock. As of February 15, 2007, there were 1,950 holders of record of our Class B common stock. 40 Dividends The following table sets forth the dividends we paid on our Class A and Class B common stock in the last two years: Record Date Dividend per Share Record Date Dividend per Share March 10, 2006 $0.63 March 10, 2005 $0.46 June 9, 2006 0.63 June 10, 2005 0.46 September 8, 2006 0.63 September 9, 2005 0.46 December 8, 2006 0.63 December 9, 2005 0.46 We intend to pay regular quarterly dividends to our shareholders. The decision to pay a dividend, however, remains within the discretion of our board of directors and may be affected by various factors, including our earnings, financial condition, capital requirements, level of indebtedness and other considerations our board of directors deems relevant. Our existing credit facility as well as future credit facilities, other future debt obligations, including any debt we may incur in connection with our proposed merger with CBOT Holdings, and statutory provisions may limit our ability to pay dividends. Additionally, our merger agreement with CBOT Holdings provides that we may not declare or pay dividends except quarterly dividends consistent with past practice. On January 31, 2007, the board of directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.86 per share, representing a 37% increase over the prior quarter, to be paid on March 26, 2007, to shareholders of record on March 9, 2007. PERFORMANCE GRAPH The following graph compares the total return on our Class A common stock with the Standard & Poor’s 500 Stock Index, the peer group of companies used on our proxy statement last year (the “Former Peer Group”) and a new group of companies (the “New Peer Group”) for the period from December 6, 2002 (the date of our initial public offering) through December 31, 2006. The figures presented below assume an initial investment of $100 in common stock at the closing prices on December 6, 2002 and in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Stock Index on November 30, 2002 and the reinvestment of all dividends into shares of common stock. We compiled the New Peer Group to more closely reflect our competitors in our industry. We believe the New Peer Group provides a more meaningful basis for comparison of our stock performance. The New Peer Group consists of: • CBOT Holdings, Inc. • InterContinentalExchange, Inc. • International Securities Exchange, Inc. • The Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc. • NYSE Group, Inc. The Former Peer Group consisted of: • Archipelago Holdings Inc. • CBOT Holdings, Inc. • InterContinentalExchange, Inc. • International Securities Exchange, Inc. • Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc. 41 CUMULATIVE TOTAL RETURN SINCE DECEMBER 6, 2002 42 12/06/02 12/31/02 12/31/03 12/31/04 12/31/05 12/31/06 Chicago Mercantile Exchange Holdings Inc. $ 100.00 $ 101.77 $ 170.46 $ 542.97 $ 878.70 $ 1,225.58 S&P 500 100.00 94.13 121.12 134.30 140.90 163.16 New Peer Group 100.00 90.99 91.41 137.60 292.82 556.98 Former Peer Group 100.00 93.46 88.32 95.33 328.79 551.80 Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities Period (a) Total Numberof Class AShares Purchased (b) Average PricePaid Per Share (c) Total Number ofShares Purchased asPart of PubliclyAnnounced TradingPlans or Programs (d) Maximum Number (or ApproximateDollar Value) ofShares that May YetBe Purchased Underthe Plans or Programs October 1 to October 31 — $ — — — November 1 to November 30 — $ — — — December 1 to December 31 74 $ 529.50 — — Total 74 $ 529.50 — — All of the share amounts set forth in the above table represent shares of the Company’s Class A common stock that were surrendered to the Company in order to fulfill tax withholding obligations of an employee upon the vesting of restricted stock on December 15, 2006.

References to our “exchange” are to Chicago Mercantile Exchange Inc. and its subsidiaries, collectively. OVERVIEW Business Structure Chicago Mercantile Exchange Holdings Inc. (CME Holdings), a Delaware stock corporation, is the holding company for Chicago Mercantile Exchange Inc. (CME), its primary wholly-owned subsidiary, and its other subsidiaries. The holding company structure is designed to provide strategic and operational flexibility. CME Holdings’ Class A common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange and The Nasdaq Global Select Market under the ticker symbol “CME.” CME, which was organized in 1898, is a designated contract market for the trading of futures and options on futures contracts. We are the largest futures exchange in the United States and the second largest in the world for the trading of futures and options on futures contracts, as measured by 2006 annual trading volume. For the second consecutive year, our annual trading volume for the year surpassed one billion contracts. Futures contracts and options on futures contracts provide investors with vehicles for protecting against, and potentially profiting from, price changes in financial instruments and physical commodities. Futures contracts are legally binding standardized agreements to buy or sell a financial instrument or commodity, specifying quantity and quality at a set price on a future date. Certain futures contracts, such as commodities and foreign exchange products, may result in physical delivery of the product traded. Other futures contracts, including those for equity index and interest rate products, are cash settled and do not involve physical delivery. To provide additional flexibility to the investment community, we also offer trading in options on futures contracts. These contracts offer the customer the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an underlying futures contract at a particular price by a particular time. We are a global exchange with customer access available in more than 70 countries. Our customers consist of professional traders, financial institutions, individual and institutional investors, major corporations, manufacturers, producers and governments. Customers include both members of the exchange and non-members. We offer our customers the opportunity to trade futures contracts and options on futures contracts on a range of products including those based on interest rates, equities, foreign exchange, commodities and alternative investments. Our products provide a means for hedging, speculating and allocating assets. We identify new products by monitoring economic trends and their impact on the risk management and speculative needs of our existing and prospective customers. Our major product lines are traded through our CME Globex electronic trading platform and our open outcry trading floors. Both of these execution facilities offer our customers immediate trade execution and price transparency. In addition, trades can be executed through privately negotiated transactions that are cleared and settled through our clearing house. We also offer trading in CME economic derivatives, which are available on the CME Auction Markets platform, and euro- and Swiss franc-denominated interest rate swaps, which are traded on the Swapstream platform. Our clearing house clears, settles and guarantees every futures and options on futures contract traded through our exchange as well as those traded by the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT). Ownership and control of our own clearing house enables us to capture the revenue associated with both the trading and clearing of our products. Ownership also enables us to more quickly and efficiently bring new products to market through coordination of our clearing functions with our product development, technology, market regulation and risk management activities. Our clearing house performance guarantee is an important function of our exchange. Because of this guarantee, our customers do not need to evaluate the credit of each potential counterparty or limit themselves to a selected set of counterparties. This flexibility increases the potential liquidity available for each trade. Additionally, the substitution of our clearing house as the counterparty to every transaction allows our customers to establish a position with one party and then to offset the position with another party. This contract offsetting process provides our customers with flexibility in establishing and adjusting positions and provides for performance bond efficiencies. 45 To ensure performance of counterparties, we establish and monitor financial requirements for our clearing firms and mark-to-market their positions at least twice a day. We also set minimum performance bond requirements for our traded products. In the unlikely event of a payment default by a clearing firm, we would first apply assets of the clearing firm to cover its payment obligation. These assets include security deposits, performance bonds and any other available assets, such as the proceeds from the sale of pledged Class A and Class B common stock and associated trading rights of the clearing firm at our exchange that are owned by or assigned to the clearing firm. In addition, we would make a demand for payment pursuant to any applicable guarantee provided to the exchange by the parent company of a clearing firm. Thereafter, if the payment default remains unsatisfied, we would use, in order, CME’s surplus funds, security deposits of other clearing firms and funds collected through an assessment against all other solvent clearing firms to satisfy the deficit. Industry Trends Derivatives exchanges that provide markets for futures and options on futures have become a global growth industry, with a compound annual growth rate of 43% from 2002 through June 2006, based on notional value. By comparison, the over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives markets have grown at a compound annual growth rate of 33% during that same period. There are a number of secular trends that we believe will continue to drive growth and innovation in our industry. They include: • A greater need for risk management and hedging tools in an increasingly uncertain global, political and economic climate; • Growing investor sophistication regarding derivatives and risk transfer markets; • A shift in asset management strategies away from passive buy-and-hold equity investment strategies towards more active strategies including those involving alternative investments and asset classes; and • Growth in hedge funds and managed funds as alternative investment vehicles designed to generate more trading-based returns than investing on the basis of other market strategies. These types of alternative investment vehicles often utilize exchange-traded derivatives contracts. Changing market dynamics have also led to increasing competition in all aspects of our business from both domestic and international sources. We face competition from other futures, securities and securities option exchanges; OTC markets and clearing organizations; consortia formed by our members and large market participants; alternative trade execution facilities; and technology firms, including market data distributors and electronic trading system developers. We expect competition to continue to intensify, particularly as a result of technological advances and reductions in the regulatory requirements for the development of products and markets that are competitive with our own. Additional factors that may intensify competition in the future include: • The growth of recently-formed for-profit exchanges; • The consolidation of exchanges, customers or intermediaries; • An increased demand for electronic trading and electronic order routing services; and • The increased ability of other exchanges to leverage their technology investment and electronic distribution to enter new markets and list products that compete with our own. 46 Strategy Our current strategy specifically focuses on leveraging our benchmark products, scalable infrastructure and clearing and trade matching technologies to benefit customers. This strategy will enable us to continue to evolve into a more broadly diversified financial exchange that offers trading and clearing solutions across additional products and asset classes. Our strategy includes coordinated efforts to: • Grow our existing business by expanding customer access to our markets and services, enhancing and offering additional trade execution choices, and improving our market data products; • Broaden our product range through innovative new products and optimization of existing products, based on research and development in collaboration with customers; • Provide third-party transaction processing, clearing and related services; and • Explore new business opportunities such as joint ventures, alliances and selective business combinations such as our recently announced merger with CBOT Holdings, Inc. Primary Sources of Operating Revenue Clearing and transaction fees. A majority of our revenue is derived from clearing and transaction fees, which include CME Globex electronic trading fees, surcharges for privately-negotiated transactions and other volume-related charges for contracts executed through our trading venues. Because clearing and transaction fees are assessed on a per-contract basis, revenues and profitability fluctuate with volume changes. In addition to the secular trends noted earlier, our revenues and trading volume tend to increase during periods of economic and geopolitical uncertainty. This is because our customers seek to manage their exposure to, or speculate on, the market volatility resulting from uncertainty. In addition, our volume is seasonal and we typically experience higher sequential volume during the first and second quarters followed by decreases in the third and fourth quarters of the calendar year. However, these patterns may be altered by the impact of economic and political events, the launch of new products, and other factors. While volume has a significant impact on our clearing and transaction fees revenue, there are four other factors that also influence this source of revenue: • Rate structure; • Mix of products traded; • Trading venue; and • The percentage of trades executed by customers who are members compared with non-member customers. Rate structure. Customers benefit from volume discounts and limits on fees as part of our effort to increase liquidity in certain products. We may periodically change fees, volume discounts, limits on fees and member discounts, perhaps significantly, based on our review of operations and the business environment. As a result of their rate structure, Total Return Asset Contracts (TRAKRS), auction-traded products and Swapstream products are excluded from disclosures of trading volume and average rate per contract in this discussion and analysis. Clearing and transaction fees on these products are immaterial relative to other CME products. TRAKRS are exchange-traded non-traditional futures contracts that trade electronically on the CME Globex electronic platform. Swapstream offers euro- and Swiss franc-denominated interest rate swap products through its inter-dealer electronic trading platform. Auction-traded products, which include CME economic derivatives, were introduced in September 2005 and are traded on the CME Auction Markets platform. Product mix. We offer trading of futures and options on futures contracts on a wide-ranging set of products based on interest rates, equities, foreign exchange, commodities and alternative investments. Rates are varied by product in order to optimize revenue on existing products and support introduction of new products to encourage trading volume. 47 Trading venue. Our exchange is an international marketplace that brings together buyers and sellers mainly through our CME Globex electronic trading platform as well as through open outcry trading on our trading floors and privately negotiated transactions. Any customer guaranteed by a clearing firm is able to obtain direct access to our CME Globex platform. Open outcry trading is conducted exclusively by our members, who may execute trades on behalf of customers or for themselves. Typically, customers executing trades through CME Globex are charged fees for using the electronic trading platform in addition to the clearing fees assessed on all transactions executed on our exchange. Customers entering into privately negotiated transactions also incur additional charges beyond the clearing fees assessed on all transactions. Member/non-member mix. Generally, member customers are charged lower fees than our non-member customers. Holding all other factors constant, revenue decreases if the percentage of trades executed by members increases, and increases if the percentage of non-member trades increases. Processing services. To further diversify the range of services we offer, we have entered into clearing and transaction processing agreements with other exchanges. This revenue will fluctuate as the trading volume of these exchanges fluctuates. The most significant portion of this revenue is derived from our agreement with CBOT. In April 2003, we entered into an agreement to provide clearing and related services for CBOT futures and options on futures contracts. We began to provide these services for some products in November 2003, and as of January 2004, we began to clear all CBOT products. The current agreement expires in January 2009. The remaining portion of this revenue includes fees for listing energy and metal futures products on the CME Globex platform for the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX). Although trading under a prior agreement with NYMEX ended in November 2005, trading under a new 10-year agreement began on June 11, 2006. We also collect fees for processing single stock futures trades for certain CME clearing firms that execute trades at OneChicago, LLC (OneChicago), our joint venture in single stock futures and futures on narrow-based stock indexes that initiated trading in November 2002. Quotation data fees. We receive quotation data fees from the dissemination of our market data to subscribers for business and private use. Our market data services are provided primarily through third-party distributors. Subscribers can obtain access to real-time, delayed and end-of-day quotation, trade and market summary data for our products. Users of our basic service receive real-time quotes and pay a flat monthly fee for each screen, or device, displaying our market data. Alternatively, customers can subscribe to market data provided on a limited group of products. The fee for this service is a relatively nominal flat rate per month. Pricing for our market data services is based on the value of the service provided, our cost structure for the service and the price of comparable services offered by our competitors. Increases or decreases in our quotation data fees revenue is influenced by changes in our price structure for existing market data offerings, introduction of new market data services and changes in the number of subscribers. General economic factors that affect the financial services industry, which constitutes our primary customer base, also influence revenue from our market data fees. Other sources. Other sources of revenue include access fees, communication fees and revenue from various services related to our operations. • Access fees are the connectivity charges to customers of our CME Globex platform, to our market data vendors and to direct market data customers. The fee each customer is charged varies depending on the type of connection provided. • Communication fees consist of charges to members and clearing firms that utilize our various telecommunications networks and communications services. Revenue from communication fees is largely dependent on open outcry trading, as a significant portion relates to telecommunications on the trading floor. 48 • Other revenue is composed of fees for administering our Interest Earning Facility (IEF) program, trade order routing, and various services to members. We offer clearing firms the opportunity to invest cash performance bonds in our various IEF offerings. These clearing firms receive interest income, and we receive a fee based on total funds on deposit. In addition, other revenue includes trading gains and losses generated by GFX Corporation (GFX), our wholly-owned subsidiary that trades primarily in foreign exchange futures contracts to enhance liquidity in our electronic markets for these products. Primary Operating Expenses With the exception of license fees paid for the trading of our equity index contracts and a component of our trading facility rent that is related to open outcry trading volume, most of our expenses do not vary directly with changes in our trading volume. Compensation and benefits. Compensation and benefits expense is our most significant expense and includes employee wages, bonuses, stock-based compensation, benefits and employer taxes. Changes in this expense are driven by fluctuations in the number of employees, increases in wages as a result of inflation or labor market conditions, rates for employer taxes and other cost increases affecting benefit plans. In addition, this expense is affected by the composition of our work force, which includes a growing percentage of technology-related employees. The expense associated with our bonus and stock-based compensation plans can also have a significant impact on this expense category and may vary from year to year. The bonus component of our compensation and benefits expense is based on our financial performance. Under the performance criteria of our annual incentive plan, the bonus funded under the plan would be the “target” level if we achieve the cash earnings target established by the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors. Cash earnings are defined as net income excluding depreciation and amortization expense and tax-effected stock-based compensation expense less capital expenditures. Under the plan, if our actual cash earnings equal 80% of the established target for a given year, the bonus will be reduced by approximately 50% of the target bonus amount. There will be no bonus if our cash earnings are less than 80% of the cash earnings target, other than for non-exempt employees who may receive a bonus under our discretionary bonus program. If our actual cash earnings equal 120% of the target or higher, the bonus would be increased by approximately 50% from the targeted bonus amount, which is the maximum amount that is allowed under the plan. If our performance is between the threshold performance level of 80% of the cash earnings target and the maximum performance level of 120% of the cash earnings target, the bonus will be calculated based on the level of performance achieved. The Compensation Committee may adjust the cash earnings calculation and the target level of performance for material, unplanned revenue, expense or capital expenditures to meet intermediate to long-term growth opportunities. Beginning in 2007, the cash earnings calculation for bonus purposes will exclude investment income and target levels will be adjusted accordingly. Stock-based compensation is a non-cash expense related to stock options and restricted stock grants. Effective January 1, 2006, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123(R), “Share-Based Payment.” SFAS No. 123(R) requires the use of the fair value method of accounting for share-based payments, which we previously adopted in 2002 under SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation.” SFAS 123(R) also requires that we estimate expected forfeitures of stock grants instead of the previous practice of accounting for forfeitures as they occurred. Furthermore, as of January 1, 2006, the excess tax benefit related to employee option exercises and restricted stock vesting has been reflected in accordance with SFAS No. 123(R) as part of cash flows from financing activities for all periods presented rather than the previous classification as part of cash flows from operating activities. Stock-based compensation varies depending on the quantity and fair value of options granted. Fair value is derived using the Black-Scholes model with assumptions about our dividend yield, the expected volatility of our stock price based on an analysis of implied and historical volatility, the risk-free interest rate and the expected life of the options granted. Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense results from the depreciation of property purchased, as well as the amortization of purchased and internally developed software. This expense has increased consistently from year to year due to significant technology investments in equipment and software. Depreciable useful lives have remained relatively consistent since January 1, 2004. 49 Other expenses. We incur additional expenses for communications, technology support services and various other activities necessary to support our operations. • Communications expense consists primarily of costs for network connections to the CME Globex platform and some market data customers; telecommunications costs of our exchange; and fees paid for access to external market data. This expense is affected primarily by the growth of electronic trading, our capacity requirements and by changes in telecommunications hubs and connections which allow customers outside the United States to access the CME Globex platform directly. • Technology support services consist of costs related to maintenance of the hardware and software required to support our technology. Our technology support services costs are driven by the number of transactions processed as well as the number of bid and offer quotes received and reflected in the order book for electronic trading, rather than the number of contracts traded. • Professional fees and outside services expense includes costs of consulting services provided for major technology initiatives and legal and accounting fees. This expense fluctuates primarily as a result of changes in the number of consultants needed to complete technology initiatives as well as other undertakings that require the use of professional services. • Occupancy expense consists mostly of rent, maintenance and utilities costs for our domestic and international offices, our trading facility in Chicago and our remote data centers. Our office space is located primarily in Chicago with smaller offices located in London, Hong Kong, Sydney, Tokyo and Washington, D.C. Occupancy costs are relatively stable, although our trading floor rent fluctuates to a limited extent based on open outcry trading volume. • Licensing and other fee arrangements expense consists primarily of license fees paid as a result of trading volume in equity index products. This expense fluctuates as a result of changes in equity index product trading volume and fee structure changes that affect license fees. In addition, in 2004 we began to incur expense under an agreement with Singapore Exchange Limited (SGX) whereby revenue sharing expense fluctuates based on our percentage of electronically traded CME Eurodollar contracts. Under the terms of our current agreement, this expense cannot exceed $0.3 million per month. We recently renewed this agreement, and effective February 5, 2007, the revenue sharing provisions of the agreement will terminate and the expense will be eliminated. • Marketing, advertising and public relations expense consists primarily of media, print and other advertising expenses, expenses incurred as part of various brand campaigns as well as the promotion of new and existing products and services. Non-Operating Income and Expense Investment income, securities lending interest income and expense, and equity in losses of unconsolidated subsidiaries were reclassified from revenues to non-operating income and expense in the consolidated statements of income during 2006. Equity in losses of unconsolidated subsidiaries was previously included as part of other revenues. All other items appeared separately in revenues. The presentation of these items has been changed to more closely conform to the Securities and Exchange Commission’s Article 5 of Regulation S-X. • Investment income represents income generated by the short-term investment of our excess cash balances and clearing firms’ cash performance bonds and security deposits; interest income and net realized gains and losses from our marketable securities; and gains and losses on trading securities in our non-qualified deferred compensation plans. The investment results of our non-qualified deferred compensation plans do not affect our net income as there is an equal impact in our compensation and benefits expense. Investment income is influenced by the amount of funds generated by operations that is available for investment, market interest rates and changes in the levels of cash performance bonds deposited by clearing firms. Investment income also included earnings from our first IEF program until its discontinuance in December 2005. • Securities lending transactions utilize a portion of the securities that clearing firms deposit to satisfy their proprietary performance bond requirements. Substantial interest expense is also incurred as part of this securities lending activity. 50 • Equity in losses of unconsolidated subsidiaries includes losses from our investments in FXMarketSpace Limited (FXMS) and OneChicago. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The notes to our consolidated financial statements include disclosure of our significant accounting policies. In establishing these policies within the framework of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, management must make certain assessments, estimates and choices that will result in the application of these principles in a manner that appropriately reflects our financial condition and results of operations. Critical accounting policies are those policies that we believe present the most complex or subjective measurements and have the most potential to affect our financial position and operating results. While all decisions regarding accounting policies are important, there are certain accounting policies that we consider to be critical. These critical policies, which are presented in detail in the notes to our consolidated financial statements, relate to revenue recognition, income taxes, internal use software costs, stock-based compensation, and goodwill and intangible assets. Revenue recognition. Our revenue recognition policies comply with Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101 on revenue recognition. Our revenue is derived primarily from the clearing and transaction fees we assess on each contract executed through our trading venues and cleared through our clearing house. Clearing and transaction fees are recognized as revenue when a buy and sell order are matched and when the trade is cleared. On occasion, the customer’s exchange trading privileges may not be properly entered by the clearing firm and incorrect fees are charged for the transactions in the affected accounts. When this information is corrected within the time period allowed by the exchange, a fee adjustment is provided to the clearing firm. An accrual is established for estimated fee adjustments to reflect corrections to customer exchange trading privileges. The accrual is based on the historical pattern of adjustments processed as well as specific adjustment requests. Occasionally, market data customers will pay for services in a lump sum payment. When these circumstances occur, revenue is recognized as services are provided. Income taxes. Calculation of the income tax provision includes an estimate of the income taxes that will be paid for the current year as well as an estimate of income tax liabilities or benefits deferred into future years, as determined in accordance with SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes.” As required by the provisions of SFAS No. 109, our deferred tax assets are reviewed to determine if all assets will be realized in future periods. To the extent it is determined that some deferred tax assets may not be fully realized, the assets must be reduced by a valuation allowance. The calculation of our tax provision involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. We recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the United States and other applicable tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes may be due. If payment of these amounts varies from our estimate, our income tax provision would be reduced or increased at the time that determination is made. This determination may not be known for several years. Past tax audits have not resulted in tax adjustments that would result in a material change to the income tax provision in the year the audit was completed. The effective tax rate, defined as the income tax provision as a percentage of income before income taxes, will vary from year to year based on changes to tax rates and regulations. In addition, the effective tax rate will vary with changes to income that are not subject to income tax, such as municipal interest income, and changes in expenses or losses that are not deductible, such as the utilization of foreign net operating losses. Internal use software costs. Certain costs for employees and consultants that are incurred in connection with work on development or implementation of software for our internal use are capitalized in accordance with the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement of Position (SOP) 98-1, “Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use.” Costs capitalized are for application development or implementation, as required by SOP 98-1, for software projects that will result in significant new functionality and that are generally expected to cost in excess of $0.5 million. The amount capitalized is determined based on the time spent by the individuals completing the eligible software-related activity and the compensation and benefits or consulting fees incurred for these activities. Projects are monitored during the development cycle to assure that they continue to meet the capitalization criteria of SOP 98-1 and that the project will be completed and placed in service as intended. Any previously capitalized costs are expensed at the time a decision is made to abandon a software project. Completed internal use software projects, as well as work-in-progress projects, are included as part of property in the consolidated balance sheets. Once completed, the accumulated costs for a particular software project are amortized over the anticipated life of the software, generally three years. Costs capitalized for internal use software will vary from year-to-year based on our technology-related business requirements. 51 Stock-based compensation. We expense stock options using the fair value method under the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R), “Share-Based Payment.” We have elected the accelerated method for recognizing the expense related to stock grants. Due to this election and the vesting provisions of our stock grants, a greater percentage of the total expense is recognized in the first and second years of the vesting period than would be recorded if we used the straight-line method. Upon adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) on January 1, 2006, we began to include an estimate of expected forfeitures of stock grants in our expense recognition calculations instead of the previous practice of accounting for forfeitures as they occur. Goodwill and intangible assets. We review goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment on an annual basis and whenever events or circumstances indicate its carrying value may not be recoverable in accordance with SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.” The provisions of SFAS No. 142 require that a two-step impairment test be performed on goodwill. In the first step, the fair value of each reporting unit is compared to its carrying amount. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying amount, no impairment exists and we are not required to perform further testing. If the carrying amount exceeds its fair value, the second step must be performed to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill. If the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, then an impairment loss is recorded in an amount equal to that excess. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. Intangible assets subject to amortization are also evaluated for impairment, when indicated by a change in circumstances, pursuant to SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.” The impairment testing requires management to estimate the fair value of the assets and record an impairment loss for the excess of the carrying value over the fair value. The estimate of the fair value of the assets is generally determined on the basis of discounted future cash flows. In estimating the fair value, management must make assumptions and projections regarding such items as future cash flows, future revenues, future earnings and other factors. Such assumptions are subject to change as a result of changing economic and competitive conditions. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In July 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes – An Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109.” FIN No. 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a company’s financial statements and prescribes that a company should use a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold based on the technical merits of the tax position taken or expected to be taken. The interpretation also provides guidance on recognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. FIN No. 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006, with any cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle recorded as an adjustment to opening retained earnings. We will adopt FIN No. 48 effective January 1, 2007. We expect no material impact on our financial statements upon initial adoption. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR 2006 COMPARED WITH 2005 2006 Financial Highlights • Total revenues grew by 22% in 2006 primarily as a result of increased clearing and transaction fees, and to a lesser extent higher revenue from processing services and quotation data fees. • Total expenses increased by 14% in 2006 when compared with 2005. The increase was primarily due to higher compensation and benefits costs as well as increased technology spending resulting from capacity expansion and processing speed enhancements. Higher rates on licensed Standard & Poor’s (S&P) and The Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc. (NASDAQ) products and increased professional and outside services fees also contributed to the increase in expenses. • Operating margin, which we define as operating income expressed as a percentage of total revenues, increased to 57% in 2006 from 54% in 2005 as the growth of operating revenue outpaced increases in operating expenses. • Cash earnings increased by approximately $111.0 million to $402.8 million for 2006 compared with 2005. We have included a reconciliation of cash earnings, a non-GAAP measure, in Liquidity and Capital Resources. 52 Revenues Increase (dollars in millions) 2006 2005 (Decrease) Clearing and transaction fees $ 866.1 $ 696.2 24 % Processing services 90.1 68.7 31 Quotation data fees 80.8 71.7 13 Access fees 20.2 18.9 7 Communication fees 8.6 9.0 (4 ) Other 24.1 25.3 (4 ) Total Revenues $ 1,089.9 $ 889.8 22 Revenue Highlights. Revenues grew in 2006 primarily due to the following: • Enhanced technology, growing distribution, uncertainty surrounding interest rates and occasional daily volatility in the equity market contributed to growth in trading volume in all product lines resulting in a 24% increase in clearing and transaction fees during 2006; • Greater trading volumes at CBOT and our new agreement to list NYMEX products on the CME Globex platform resulted in increased processing services revenue; and • Increased monthly subscriber fees, which became effective January 1, 2006, contributed to an increase in quotation data fees for the year. Clearing and Transaction Fees. The increase was due to trading volume growth partially offset by a decrease in the average rate per contract. The following table summarizes average daily trading volume (in thousands) and revenue. All amounts exclude TRAKRS, CME Auction Markets and Swapstream products. 2006 2005 Increase CME Product Line Volume: Interest rate 3,078 2,380 29 % Equity(1) 1,734 1,389 25 Foreign exchange 453 334 35 Commodity and alternative investment (1) 78 55 41 Total Average Daily Volume 5,343 4,158 28 CME Globex Volume 3,808 2,895 31 CME Globex Volume as a Percentage of Total Volume 71 % 70 % Clearing and Transaction Fees (in millions) $ 864.4 $ 695.7 Average Rate per Contract $ 0.645 $ 0.664 (1) CME weather and Goldman Sachs Commodity Index products are included in commodities and alternative investments rather than equities beginning in 2006. Prior period amounts have been adjusted to conform to the current year presentation. • Volume In 2006, our volume surpassed one billion contracts traded for the second consecutive year driven by growth of 25% or more in all product lines. Technology enhancements, including the migration of our CME Globex trading platform to new Hewlett Packard Integrity NonStop servers that incorporate Intel Itanium processors, significantly increased trade-matching speed which reduced our average response time on transactions and resulted in increased usage by automated trading systems. Growth in hedge funds, interest rate uncertainty and occasional daily volatility in equity markets also contributed to trading volume growth. 53 Interest Rate Products Interest rate product volume increased in 2006 primarily due to uncertain market expectations surrounding interest rates, including those created by changes in Federal Reserve monetary policy, expansion in the use of our electronic trading platform as a result of technological enhancement and increased use of automated trading systems. The volume of interest rate products traded electronically increased by 34% to 1.8 million contracts per day in 2006. Secular trends favoring the trading of derivative products also contributed to the increase in volume. The average daily volume of CME Eurodollar options, which are traded predominantly through open outcry, increased by 44% to 1.1 million contracts in 2006. In conjunction with the increase in Eurodollar options volume, the average daily volume of CME Eurodollar options traded electronically also increased to 77,000 contracts in 2006 from 28,000 contracts in 2005. In April 2006, we launched a new incentive program to increase electronic trading of CME Eurodollar options. The program, which was initially effective through December 2006, has been extended through June 2007. The program provides a reduced fee schedule for customers meeting percentage thresholds for electronic trading of CME Eurodollar options. Equity Products The increase in equity product volume for the year was primarily due to technological enhancements, increased usage of equity option products, occasional significant daily fluctuations in stock market volatility, as measured by the CBOE Volatility Index, and efforts to attract new customers. Average daily volume of our E-mini equity products increased by 25% to 1.6 million contracts in 2006 compared with 2005. In particular, E-mini S&P 500 volume increased 27% to 1.1 million contracts. Volume for our electronically traded E-mini equity options increased to 45,000 contracts per day in 2006 from 18,000 contracts per day in 2005. Foreign Exchange Products In December 2006, foreign exchange volume set a monthly volume record with 621,000 contracts traded per day. The increase in trading of foreign exchange products resulted from the previously mentioned technological enhancements which facilitated faster execution of trades, additional liquidity and fee incentive programs, including those specifically targeted to attract commodity trading advisors and large hedge funds. In 2006, 88% of our foreign exchange volume traded through the CME Globex platform compared with 81% during 2005. Commodity and Alternative Investment Products Trading in commodity and alternative investment products increased as a result of the growing appeal of commodities as an asset class, which has attracted additional trading activity in live cattle and lean hog products. • Average Rate Per Contract The impact of the 28% increase in average daily trading volume during 2006 was partially offset by a decrease in the average rate, or revenue, per contract. In 2006, the average rate per contract decreased 3%, to $0.645 from $0.664 in 2005, primarily due to the following factors: • Incentives and discounts increased as a result of volume growth, reducing the average rate per contract by $0.021; • The number of inactive clearing firms and trading volume from automated trading systems that receive lower-priced member rates increased resulting in a slight rise in the percentage of trades executed by member customers to 80% of total volume from 79% in 2005; • Higher-priced privately negotiated trades, as a percentage of total volume, decreased to 1.0% during 2006 compared with 1.2% in 2005; and 54 • The average daily volume of CME Eurodollar options traded through open outcry, one of our lowest priced products, increased by 38%. This represented 19% of total volume in 2006 compared with 17% in 2005. Clearing and transaction fees from CME Eurodollar options traded through open outcry averaged $0.33 per contract in 2006 and 2005. These decreases were partially offset by broad-based pricing increases implemented in August 2005, which contributed incremental revenue of approximately $13.0 million when compared with 2005. Additionally, the rate per contract was favorably impacted by a higher percentage of trades executed through the CME Globex platform for which additional fees are assessed. A substantial portion of our clearing and transaction fees are billed to our clearing firms. The majority of clearing and transaction fees received from clearing firms represent charges for trades executed on behalf of their customers. We currently have approximately 85 clearing firms. No one firm represented 10% or more of clearing and transaction fees revenue in 2006. Should a clearing firm discontinue operations, we believe the customer portion of that firm’s trading activity would likely transfer to another clearing firm of the exchange. Therefore, we do not believe we are exposed to significant risk from the loss of revenue earned from any particular firm. Processing Services. Revenue increased primarily as a result of increased trading volume at CBOT and higher volume executed on the CME Globex platform under our new agreement with NYMEX. CBOT’s average daily trading volume was 3.2 million contracts for 2006, an increase of 20% over the 2.7 million contracts traded in 2005. Increased volume at CBOT generated incremental revenue of $11.6 million in 2006. Revenue from services provided to NYMEX increased by $9.8 million in 2006 when compared with 2005. Our prior agreement with NYMEX ended in November 2005. Trading under our new 10-year agreement began in June 2006. The new agreement added metals futures products and expanded the number of energy futures products, including the addition of physically delivered WTI futures products, which we now list for NYMEX on the CME Globex platform. As a result, the average daily volume of NYMEX electronic trading increased significantly on our platform during 2006. Quotation Data Fees. The growth in revenue resulted primarily from a fee increase that was implemented on January 1, 2006. Users of our basic service paid $40 per month for each market data screen, or device in 2006. The monthly charge in effect during 2005 was $35. This higher rate contributed to a $10.4 million increase in subscriber fees for 2006 compared with 2005 and was partially offset by a $1.5 million decrease in assessments, which result from our periodic audits of usage data previously provided by our customers. During 2006, approximately 55% of our quotation data fees revenue was generated from the two largest resellers of our market data. Despite this concentration, we do not believe we are exposed to a significant risk of revenue loss. In the event one of these vendors no longer subscribed to our market data, we believe the majority of the vendor’s customers would likely subscribe to our market data through another reseller. Effective January 1, 2007, users of our basic service will pay $50 per month for each market data screen, or device. Access Fees. Growth in revenue resulted from the expiration, in July 2006, of an incentive program to encourage our customers to switch to a higher bandwidth connection. 55 Expenses (dollars in millions) 2006 2005 Increase Compensation and benefits $ 203.0 $ 179.6 13 % Communications 31.6 31.1 2 Technology support services 31.2 26.8 16 Professional fees and outside services 34.3 26.8 28 Depreciation and amortization 72.8 64.9 12 Occupancy 29.6 28.5 4 Licensing and other fee agreements 25.7 18.0 43 Marketing, advertising and public relations 16.7 13.3 26 Other 24.2 23.1 5 Total Expenses $ 469.1 $ 412.1 14 Expense Highlights. Increases in total expenses for 2006 were primarily driven by the following factors: • Compensation and benefits expense increased due to growth in average headcount as well as annual salary raises and the rising costs of related benefits, incentive pay and stock-based compensation; • Depreciation and amortization, as well as greater technological support services expense, grew as a result of ongoing investments in equipment and software to expand our infrastructure and improve processing speed; • Licensing rates increased due to the full year impact of our exclusive licensing agreements with NASDAQ and S&P, which were renegotiated and extended in 2005. These rate increases combined with volume growth in these licensed products resulted in increased licensing fees; and • Professional fees associated with additional exploration of business expansion opportunities and ongoing litigation resulted in increased expenses of this nature. Various technology initiatives also contributed to an increase in professional fees. In 2007, we expect operating expenses to total $530.0 to $540.0 million. This includes Swapstream-related expenditures, merger-related planning costs, and costs associated with agreements to provide various services to FXMS. Compensation and Benefits. The increase in compensation and benefits expense during 2006 relative to 2005 consisted primarily of the following: (dollars in millions) Increase (Decrease) Average headcount $ 9.8 Net annual salary increases and changes in benefits and employer taxes 7.4 Bonus 4.3 Stock-based compensation 3.8 Capitalization for software development and reimbursable design costs (3.6 ) • Average headcount increased by 7%, or 87 employees, in 2006 compared with 2005 primarily as a result of increased hiring to support technology initiatives. Our acquisition of Swapstream, which was completed in August 2006, also contributed to the increase in average headcount for the year. As of December 31, 2006, we had 1,430 employees. • Bonus expense accrued under the provisions of our annual incentive plan increased primarily due to growth in our employee headcount and salary increases for existing employees. • Stock-based compensation increased primarily as a result of additional expense from options granted in June 2006 and the full impact in 2006 of the expense related to the June 2005 grant. In addition, the fair value per share of options granted in June 2006 increased when compared with the fair value of options granted in June 2005. 56 • Increases were partially offset by increased capitalization of compensation and benefits expense relating to software development. The increase in capitalized software costs resulted primarily from development needed to provide trading and other services to FXMS, our new joint venture with Reuters Group PLC. Technology Support Services. We experienced growth of 20% in the average number of transactions processed electronically during 2006 when compared with 2005. As a result of the continued growth in transactions processed, additional maintenance and service contracts were required to support increases in hardware and software purchases. Professional Fees and Outside Services. Legal fees increased $4.1 million in 2006 when compared with 2005 due primarily to the structuring and establishment of FXMS and litigation costs related to the ongoing antitrust lawsuit filed by Eurex U.S. in 2003. In addition, other professional fees increased $3.4 million in 2006 primarily due to the use of consulting services to support several clearing and trading systems projects as well as enhancements to the CME Globex platform’s functionality, including its ability to execute complex options trading strategies. During the fourth quarter, merger-related integration planning also contributed to an increase in professional fees. We expect merger-related integration planning to continue throughout 2007. Depreciation and Amortization. During the second quarter of 2006, we began an 18-month process of migrating the electronic trading of products to new Hewlett Packard Integrity NonStop servers that incorporate Intel Itanium processors. As a result of the migration, we reassessed and shortened the estimated useful lives on our existing processors which resulted in additional depreciation expense of $1.9 million in 2006 when compared with 2005. In addition, depreciation and amortization of 2005 and 2006 property additions exceeded the depreciation and amortization of assets that have become fully depreciated or retired since January 1, 2005, resulting in an increase in 2006 depreciation and amortization expense. Property additions for 2006 and 2005 are summarized below. Technology-related assets include purchases of computers and related equipment, software, the cost of developing internal use software and costs associated with the expansion of our data centers. (dollars in millions) 2006 2005 Total property additions $ 88.2 $ 87.6 Technology-related assets as a percentage of total additions 90 % 91 % Occupancy. We entered into two new leases for additional space in Chicago and London during 2006. The Chicago lease, which began in August 2006, will provide us with an opportunity to reorganize and maximize the utilization of our facilities in the downtown area. The London lease, which began in November 2006, will allow us to consolidate our existing London office with Swapstream’s facilities. The new leases resulted in additional rent expense of $1.1 million in 2006. Licensing and Other Fee Agreements. A large portion of the increase in this expense was attributable to an increase in licensing rates for S&P E-mini products and, to a lesser extent, NASDAQ E-mini products. Rate increases went into effect in June 2005 for NASDAQ products and September 2005 for S&P products in return for extending our exclusive rights to offer these products. Renegotiated licensing rates resulted in $6.5 million of incremental expense compared with 2005. Also, higher average daily trading volume for licensed products resulted in additional expense of $2.4 million in 2006. Higher volumes were primarily attributable to S&P 500 and NASDAQ 100 E-mini products. These increases in expense were partially offset by a $0.9 million decrease in fees paid to market maker program participants. The reduction in market maker fees was primarily due to the expiration of the Russell 1000 program in December 2005. Effective February 5, 2007, our Eurodollar fee sharing agreement with SGX will terminate resulting in an estimated decrease in expense of approximately $3.3 million in 2007. 57 Marketing, Advertising, and Public Relations. In 2006, this expense increased primarily as a result of the preparation for and launch of a new global brand advertising campaign. The promotion of new products and production of CME’s quarterly magazine, which launched in the third quarter of 2005, also contributed to an increase in expense. Non-Operating Income and Expense (dollars in millions) 2006 2005 Increase Investment income $ 55.8 $ 31.4 77 % Securities lending interest income 94.0 58.7 60 Securities lending interest expense (92.1 ) (56.8 ) 62 Equity in losses of unconsolidated subsidiaries (6.9 ) (2.6 ) 162 Total Non-Operating $ 50.8 $ 30.7 65 Investment Income. Rising market interest rates as well as increased funds available for investment resulted in increased investment income in 2006 when compared with 2005. Increases in investment income were partially offset by an increase in tax-advantaged investments, as a percentage of the total portfolio, during 2006. The annualized average rate of return and average investment balance indicated in the table below include short-term investments classified as cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and clearing firms’ cash performance bonds and security deposits, but exclude the first IEFs and our non-qualified deferred compensation plan. Non-qualified deferred compensation plan earnings are excluded from this analysis as there is an equal and offsetting amount in compensation and benefits expense. (dollars in millions) 2006 2005 Increase Annualized average rate of return 4.28 % 2.99 % 1.29 % Average investment balance $ 1,258 $ 952 $ 306 Increase in investment income due to rate change $ 16.2 Increase in investment income due to balance change 9.2 Increases due to rate and balance changes were partially offset by a decrease of $1.9 million resulting from the discontinuance of the first IEFs in December 2005. Securities Lending Interest Income and Expense. The average daily balance of funds available for lending increased during 2006 relative to 2005. This was primarily the result of a policy change effective October 1, 2005 that increased the amount of securities available for lending to 70% from 50% of total eligible securities. (dollars in billions) 2006 2005 Increase (Decrease) Average daily balance of funds invested $ 1.9 $ 1.8 $ 0.1 Annualized average rate earned 5.01 % 3.34 % 1.67 % Annualized average rate paid 4.91 3.23 1.68 Net earned from securities lending 0.10 0.11 (0.01 ) Equity in Losses of Unconsolidated Subsidiaries. This includes $6.1 million of losses from our investment in FXMS, which was formed in July 2006, as well as our proportionate share of losses from OneChicago. 58 Income Tax Provision In 2006, the effective tax rate decreased from 39.6% to 39.4% when compared with 2005. The decrease is due primarily to increased investments in tax-advantaged securities, the impact of which was partially offset by the effect of a valuation allowance for the net operating losses generated by our Swapstream operations subsequent to the acquisition in August 2006. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR 2005 COMPARED WITH 2004 2005 Financial Highlights • Total revenues increased by 23% to $889.8 million driven primarily by increases in clearing and transaction fees, processing services and quotation data fees. • Total expenses increased by 13% to $412.1 million due primarily to technology spending related to additional functionality and capacity. • Growth in revenues exceeded increases in expenses resulting in an increase in our operating margin to 54% from 49% in 2004. Operating margin is defined as operating income expressed as a percentage of total revenues. • Total property additions increased to $87.6 million primarily due to continued investments in capacity related to transaction growth and additional functionality. • Working capital, defined as current assets less current liabilities, grew by $280.9 million. Revenues (dollars in millions) 2005 2004 Increase (Decrease) Clearing and transaction fees $ 696.2 $ 553.0 26 % Processing services 68.7 55.9 23 Quotation data fees 71.7 60.9 18 Access fees 18.9 16.4 15 Communication fees 9.0 10.0 (11 ) Other 25.3 25.4 — Total Revenues $ 889.8 $ 721.6 23 Revenue Highlights. Total revenues increased by 23% primarily as a result of the following factors: • Clearing and transaction fees increased by $143.2 million due primarily to a 34% increase in average daily trading volume. • Trading volume executed through CME Globex increased for all major product lines. • Processing services totaled $68.7 million, an increase of $12.7 million, primarily due to volume increases at CBOT and NYMEX. • Quotation data fees increased by $10.8 million primarily as a result of a fee increase. Clearing and Transaction Fees. A significant portion of the increase in clearing and transaction fees in 2005 was attributable to the 34% increase in average daily trading volume. In 2005, we set annual volume records in our four major product lines and, for the first time ever, the total annual volume of our products surpassed one billion contracts compared with our previous record of 787 million contracts in 2004. In addition, there was an increase in the percentage of trading volume executed through the CME Globex platform. In 2005, CME Globex volume was 70% of average daily trading volume, compared with 57% during 2004. All of our product lines experienced growth in CME Globex volume during 2005 when compared with 2004. 59 The following table summarizes average daily trading volume (in thousands) and revenue. All amounts exclude TRAKRS and auction-traded products. 2005 2004 Increase CME Product Line Volume: Interest rate 2,380 1,705 40 % Equity(1) 1,389 1,161 20 Foreign exchange 334 202 65 Commodity and alternative investment (1) 55 43 29 Total Average Daily Volume 4,158 3,111 34 CME Globex Volume 2,895 1,786 62 CME Globex Volume as a Percentage of Total Volume 70 % 57 % Clearing and Transaction Fees (in millions) $ 695.7 $ 552.6 Average Rate per Contract $ 0.664 $ 0.702 (1) CME weather and Goldman Sachs Commodity Index products are included in commodities and alternative investments rather than equities beginning in 2006. Prior period amounts have been adjusted to conform to the current year presentation. • Volume Interest Rate Products We experienced an increase in our interest rate volume in 2005 compared with 2004 due to the following factors: • Expansion in the use of our electronic trading platform as a result of technological enhancements; • Rising short-term interest rates and periods of heightened volatility in the equity markets, although overall implied volatility was lower than in 2004; • Increased volume by European market participants due to higher relative volatility in the U.S. compared to the Eurozone; • Increased utilization of competitive fee programs designed to encourage the participation of market makers and global proprietary trading firms; and • The appeal of tiered pricing provided to high volume traders. The average daily volume of interest rate products traded electronically increased from 594,000 contracts in 2004 to 1.3 million contracts in 2005 with 57% of interest rate volume executed on the CME Globex platform compared with 35% in 2004. Equity Products Trading volume for our equity products increased primarily as a result of the continued growth in our CME E-mini products due to increased distribution to new users. This was achieved despite volatility in the U.S. equity markets that was 17% lower in 2005 when compared with 2004 as measured by the CBOE Volatility Index. During 2005, average daily volume of CME E-mini products increased by 21% to 1.3 million contracts when compared with 2004. The strongest growth in average daily volume occurred in CME E-mini S&P 500 futures, which increased by 0.2 million contracts, CME E-mini Russell 2000 futures and CME E-mini S&P MidCap 400 futures. We also experienced growth in our E-mini equity option products. Foreign Exchange Products Our foreign exchange volume has benefited from increased demand from automated trading systems, driven primarily by technology enhancements that allow faster execution. We also experienced volume growth from commodity trading advisors and large hedge funds as a result of initiatives implemented in 2005. Fee incentive programs initiated during the second quarter of 2004 also resulted in increased trading on the CME Globex platform. In 2005, 81% of our foreign exchange volume was executed through CME Globex compared with 66% in 2004. 60 • Average Rate Per Contract Partially offsetting the impact of the increase in trading volume on revenue was a decrease in the average rate, or revenue, per contract. The average rate per contract decreased to $0.664 for 2005 from $0.702 in 2004 primarily due to the following factors: • An increase in the percentage of trades by member customers reduced the rate per contract. As a result of a decrease in the capital investment required to become a clearing firm, which became effective October 1, 2004, there was an increase in the number of inactive clearing firms that are charged member rates. During 2005, we also implemented a program to allow multiple hedge funds within the same fund group to receive member rates. • Growth in interest rate, equity and foreign exchange trading volume, as a result of the appeal of our competitive fee programs, as well as increased participation of market makers, resulted in higher incentives and discounts, which further reduced the average rate per contract by $0.037 in 2005. • Our mutual offset agreement with SGX, whereby there is a net settlement for trades executed by the originating exchange but transferred to the other exchange, had an unfavorable impact on the average rate per contract of $0.005 in 2005. • These decreases were partially offset by the higher percentage of trades on the CME Globex platform for all product lines, for which additional fees are assessed. • Finally, rate increases effective August 1, 2005, contributed additional revenue of approximately $7.0 million and resulted in a modest increase to the overall average rate per contract of $0.007, which partially offset other factors that resulted in the lower average rate per contract in 2005. In addition to the change in the rate structure in 2005, we also extended the European and Asian incentive programs and the electronic corporate membership program through December 31, 2006. In 2005, we implemented two one-year incentive programs designed to attract large hedge funds and commodity trading advisors to our foreign exchange markets. We also launched a new emerging markets partner program to support the geographic expansion of European and U.S.-based proprietary trading firms and trading arcades into developing trading centers. This two-year program provides fee waivers for new users of our electronic markets in qualified regions around the world. Processing Services. The increase was primarily the result of increased volume at CBOT as well as the expiration of lower initial pricing for that service that was in effect during much of 2004. We cleared 675 million CBOT contracts during 2005 compared with 600 million contracts during 2004. In addition, we earned $3.8 million in incremental revenue from our agreement with NYMEX due to increased trading volume and related increased fees for these trades. Trading volume related to NYMEX increased to 5.2 million contracts in 2005 from 0.9 million contracts in 2004. Our agreement with NYMEX expired and we stopped listing NYMEX products on the CME Globex platform as of November 18, 2005. We entered into a new agreement with NYMEX in June 2006. Quotation Data Fees. The increase in quotation data fees resulted primarily from the rate change that was implemented on January 1, 2005. Users of our basic service pay $35 per month for each market data screen, or device, an increase from the $30 per month charge that was in effect during 2004. In addition, there was an increase of $0.9 million related to assessments resulting from our periodic audits of the usage data provided by our customers. Access Fees. The increase in access fees was attributed primarily to CME Globex users converting to higher bandwidth connections, at a higher fee beginning in the third quarter of 2004. Communication Fees. Communication fees decreased primarily as a result of reduced demand for communication devices and services on the trading floor accompanied by a decrease in demand by our building tenants. 61 Expenses (dollars in millions) 2005 2004 Increase (Decrease) Compensation and benefits $ 179.6 $ 164.8 9 % Communications 31.1 27.0 15 Technology support services 26.8 21.3 26 Professional fees and outside services 26.8 25.0 8 Depreciation and amortization 64.9 53.4 22 Occupancy 28.5 27.2 5 Licensing and other fee agreements 18.0 12.2 47 Marketing, advertising and public relations 13.3 11.0 21 Other 23.1 24.2 (5 ) Total Expenses $ 412.1 $ 366.1 13 Expense Highlights. While there was a 23% increase in total revenues in 2005, total expenses increased by 13% driven primarily by the following factors: • Compensation and benefits increased as a result of annual salary and related benefit increases, a 3% increase in average headcount and increases in stock-based compensation. • We renegotiated and extended the exclusivity of our licensing agreements with NASDAQ and S&P. As a result, expenses for licensing and other fee arrangements increased primarily due to the increased fees payable under these agreements. • A 39% increase in transactions processed electronically resulted in increased technology support services expense. • We continued to add to and improve our data centers resulting in an increase in depreciation and amortization of $11.5 million over 2004. • Initiatives to expand product-specific marketing and to rebrand existing marketing and advertising materials contributed to an increase in marketing, advertising and public relations. Compensation and Benefits. Although there are a number of factors that affected compensation and benefits, the primary drivers of the increase were: • Annual salary increases and related increases in employer taxes and benefits resulted in approximately $7.2 million of additional expense during 2005 when compared with 2004. • The average number of employees increased approximately 3%, or by 42 employees, to 1,296 in 2005 from 1,254 in 2004. We had 1,321 employees at December 31, 2005. This increased headcount resulted in additional compensation and benefits, excluding bonuses, of approximately $4.6 million. • Stock-based compensation increased $4.8 million to $12.6 million in 2005 from $7.8 million in 2004. This increase resulted primarily from an increase in the fair value per share of options granted in 2005. The higher fair value was driven primarily by the increase in our stock price. • We experienced a $1.5 million increase in capitalized compensation and benefits that relates to development of internal use software, thereby reducing the amount of compensation and benefits that was expensed in 2005. Communications. During 2005, we experienced greater communications expense of $4.4 million. This increase is related to a number of items including, but not limited to, expansion of our international communications hubs in Europe and Asia. We now have seven hubs in Europe and one in Asia. In addition, our bandwidth upgrades for customers, increased connections for new CME Globex users and additional bandwidth now provided between our main location and our remote data centers also contributed to the increase in communications expense. 62 Technology support services. The number of transactions we processed electronically increased approximately 39% in 2005. As a result, additional capital purchases were required to accommodate this growth and our expenses for software, software maintenance and hardware maintenance increased $5.1 million when compared with 2004. Professional Fees and Outside Services. We incurred $2.5 million in additional professional fees, net of amounts capitalized for internally developed software, that related primarily to our technology initiatives, including integration of enhanced options trading functionality onto the CME Globex platform and implementation of new mass quoting functionality for certain foreign exchange and equity option products. Partially offsetting this increase was a decrease of $0.7 million in other professional fees and outside services, primarily due to reduced legal fees and recruiting expenses. Depreciation and Amortization. This increase was the result of depreciation and amortization of 2005 asset acquisitions exceeding the depreciation and amortization of assets that have become fully depreciated or retired since December 31, 2004. The main components of the 2005 asset additions were technology equipment and leasehold improvements to our remote data centers. Also, a greater portion of our fixed assets are now depreciating over shorter lives. This change became effective January 1, 2004 when the estimated useful lives of new technology equipment purchases were reduced from four to three years and new personal computer purchases were reduced from three to two years. Property additions for 2005 and 2004 are summarized below. Technology-related assets include purchases of computers and related equipment, software, the cost of developing internal use software and costs associated with the build-out of our data centers. (dollars in millions) 2005 2004 Total property additions $ 87.6 $ 67.5 Technology-related assets as a percentage of total additions 91 % 86 % Licensing and Other Fee Agreements. The increase resulted primarily from $3.5 million in additional license fees in 2005 when compared with 2004 as a result of increased licensing rates for certain of our equity products and increased trading volume. The NASDAQ and S&P licensing agreements were renegotiated in April 2005 and September 2005, respectively. Rates increased for these licensing agreements as a result of the renegotiations in return for an extension of exclusivity. Additionally, we incurred $2.3 million of incremental expense related to our revenue sharing agreements with SGX and market makers designated for certain products. The SGX increase resulted from the growth in electronic trading of CME Eurodollar contracts after our regular floor trading hours. Marketing, Advertising and Public Relations. The increase in marketing, advertising and public relations expense is attributable to increased product-specific marketing especially for our foreign exchange products, the launch of CME Magazine and rebranding of brochures and direct marketing materials. During 2005, we also incurred $0.4 million of expense related to a donation for hurricane relief. There was no similar expense in 2004. Non-Operating Income and Expense (dollars in millions) 2005 2004 Increase (Decrease) Investment income $ 31.4 $ 14.5 117 % Securities lending interest income 58.7 20.3 n.m. Securities lending interest expense (56.8 ) (19.0 ) n.m. Equity in losses of unconsolidated subsidiaries (2.6 ) (3.6 ) (27 ) Total Non-Operating $ 30.7 $ 12.2 151 n.m. not meaningful 63 Investment Income. The increase is primarily a result of interest rate increases in the marketplace. Also, funds available for investment continued to increase in large part due to growth in net income. (dollars in millions) 2005 2004 Increase Annualized average rate of return 2.99 % 1.63 % 1.36 % Average investment balance $ 952 $ 689 $ 263 Increase in investment income due to rate change $ 12.9 Increase in investment income due to balance change 4.4 Offsetting these increases was a $0.4 million decrease in IEF interest income and other investment income. The first IEFs were included in our consolidated financial statements until they were discontinued in December 2005. Securities Lending Interest Income and Expense. In October 2005, we increased the amount of eligible securities available for lending to 70% from 50%. In addition, throughout 2005 the balance of firm securities held that were eligible for securities lending increased. Both of these items, as well as the continued increase in interest rates by the Federal Open Market Committee of the Federal Reserve, had a significant impact on securities lending interest year over year. (dollars in billions) 2005 2004 Increase Average daily balance of funds invested $ 1.8 $ 1.4 $ 0.4 Annualized average rate earned 3.34 % 1.46 % 1.88 % Annualized average rate paid 3.23 1.37 1.86 Net earned from securities lending 0.11 0.09 0.02 Income Tax Provision The effective tax rate was 39.6% for 2005 compared with 40.3% for 2004. The effective tax rate declined as a result of an increase in tax-advantaged investments and the favorable resolution of certain tax audit issues. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash Requirements Historically, we have met our funding requirements from operations. If operations do not provide sufficient funds to meet capital expenditure requirements, cash and cash equivalents or marketable securities can be reduced to provide the needed funds, assets can be acquired through capital leases, or we can issue debt. In addition, we believe we can fund any pending or potential future acquisitions with internally available cash, debt financing or the issuance of equity securities. On October 17, 2006, we entered into an agreement and plan of merger with CBOT Holdings, Inc. This proposed merger is subject to an affirmative vote by CME Holdings’ and CBOT Holdings’ stockholders and CBOT members, normal regulatory approvals and other closing conditions. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, CBOT Holdings’ shareholders will have the right to receive 0.3006 shares of CME Holdings Class A common stock per share of CBOT Holdings Class A common stock or to elect an amount in cash equal to the value of the exchange ratio based on a ten day average of closing prices of our Class A common stock at the time of the merger. However, the maximum amount of cash available for all CBOT Holdings’ shareholders is $3.0 billion. Upon the closing of the transaction, which is expected to occur in mid-2007, we will need up to approximately $3.1 billion to purchase the shares of CBOT Holdings’ shareholders electing to receive cash and to pay estimated fees and expenses related to the transaction. We expect to fund the transaction with cash and cash equivalents, proceeds from expected maturities of our marketable securities and various short- and long-term debt facilities as needed based on the amount of the cash election made by CBOT Holdings’ shareholders. If either CME Holdings or CBOT Holdings were to terminate the merger agreement, the terminating party may be required to pay the other party a termination fee of $240.0 million and to reimburse the other party for expenses up to $6.0 million. 64 Cash will also be required for operating leases and non-cancelable purchase obligations as well as commitments reflected as liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2006. These commitments are as follows (in thousands): Year Operating Leases Purchase Obligations Other Liabilities Total 2007 $ 14,270 $ 25,975 $ 2,085 $ 42,330 2008-2009 24,301 12,892 — 37,193 2010-2011 15,637 5,015 — 20,652 Thereafter 67,972 10,407 — 78,379 Total $ 122,180 $ 54,289 $ 2,085 $ 178,554 Future operating lease commitments at December 31, 2006 increased from year-end 2005 primarily as a result of two new operating leases to obtain additional office space in Chicago and London. Future capital expenditures for technology are anticipated as we continue to invest in increased system capacity and performance and pursue technological initiatives on our electronic trading platform, such as: implementation of additional functionality for CME Eurodollar and foreign exchange options; increased functionality for more user defined spreads; and other facilitation of options and futures trading. Each year capital expenditures are incurred for improvements throughout our central location and our remote data centers. Capital expenditures also are incurred for improvements to our trading floor facilities, offices, telecommunications capabilities and other operating equipment. We expect 2007 capital expenditures to total approximately $110.0 million, excluding leasehold improvements for our new office space that will be funded with landlord allowances. Anticipated capital expenditures for 2007 include approximately $20.0 million of data center build-out costs related to our pending merger with and integration of CBOT Holdings. We intend to continue to pay regular quarterly dividends to our shareholders. In 2006, our annual dividend target remained at approximately 30% of the prior year’s cash earnings. The decision to pay a dividend, however, remains within the discretion of our Board of Directors and may be affected by various factors, including our earnings, financial condition, capital requirements, level of indebtedness and other considerations our Board of Directors deems relevant. On January 31, 2007, the Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.86 per share payable on March 26, 2007 to shareholders of record on March 9, 2007. Assuming no changes in the number of shares outstanding, the March 2007 dividend payment will total approximately $30.0 million. Sources and Uses of Cash Net cash provided by operating activities was $471.7 million for 2006 and $348.2 million for 2005. The net cash provided by operations increased primarily as a result of our improved operating results. This increase was partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable and deferred taxes. The net cash provided by operating activities exceeded our net income in 2006 and 2005 primarily as a result of non-cash expenses, such as depreciation and amortization, which do not adversely affect our cash flow. Cash used in investing activities was $85.9 million for 2006 compared with $82.3 million for 2005. Even though there was a reduction of $40.4 million in the purchases of marketable securities in 2006, additional cash was used for the purchase of Swapstream and the investment in FXMS, which were $17.7 million and $13.9 million, respectively. These factors resulted in a slight increase in cash used of $3.5 million. Property additions include capital expenditures of purchased and internally developed software and leasehold improvements, including those acquired with lease allowances. Property additions in 2006 include leasehold improvements of $8.0 million related to the expansion of our remote data centers, $7.3 million related to the remodeling of the office space at our main location and $0.5 65 million related to remodeling of our new office space in Chicago. Property additions in 2005 included leasehold improvements of $22.8 million related to the expansion of our remote data centers and $5.8 million related to the remodeling of the office space at our main location. Technology-related assets include purchases of computers and related equipment software, the cost of developing internal use software and costs associated with the build-out and expansion of our data centers. Technology-related additions increased $0.2 million to $79.7 million in 2006 from $79.5 million in 2005. These additions related primarily to expanding capacity to accommodate the growth in electronic trading on the CME Globex platform, clearing trades for CBOT, listing trades for NYMEX, improving speed and reliability in our systems and implementing other system enhancements. Cash used in financing activities was $27.2 million in 2006 compared with $12.6 million in 2005. The increase was primarily due to the $24.2 million increase in dividends paid. Dividends totaled $87.5 million in 2006 compared with $63.3 million in 2005. The increase resulted primarily from our improved prior year’s cash earnings, which is the basis used to determine the amount of the current year’s dividend. Partially offsetting this increase was an increase of $8.5 million in proceeds from options exercised. Debt Instruments We maintain a line of credit with a consortium of banks to be used in certain situations, such as disruption in the domestic payment system that would delay settlement between our exchange and our clearing firms or in the event of a clearing firm default. In order to ensure that the facility would operate as intended, CME periodically draws down nominal amounts of funds against the letter of credit, and immediately repays the amounts borrowed. On October 13, 2006, the line of credit was renewed and the amount of the revolving line of credit was increased from $750.0 million to $800.0 million, with terms substantially the same as the expiring line of credit. We have the option to request an increase to the facility from $800.0 million to $1.0 billion at the time of a draw, subject to the approval of the participating banks. The credit agreement continues to be collateralized by clearing firm security deposits held by us in the form of U.S. Treasury or agency securities, as well as security deposit funds in IEF2 and any performance bond deposits of the defaulting firm. The line of credit can only be drawn on to the extent it is collateralized. Collateral available and on deposit was $1.2 billion at December 31, 2006. In October 2005, we approved the use of CME-owned U.S. Treasury securities as performance bond collateral in lieu of, or in combination with, irrevocable letters of credit for our mutual offset agreement with SGX. We can pledge U.S. Treasury securities up to a maximum of $100.0 million measured as the aggregate fair value at the time of the most recent collateral adjustment. At December 31, 2006, we were contingently liable on irrevocable letters of credit totaling $19.0 million and had pledged securities with a fair value of $100.7 million. CME also guarantees a $5.0 million standby letter of credit for GFX. The beneficiary of the letter of credit is the clearing firm that is used by GFX to execute and maintain its futures positions. The letter of credit will be utilized in the event that GFX defaults in meeting performance bond requirements to its clearing firm. In the unlikely event of a payment default by GFX, GFX’s performance bond deposits would first be used to cover any deficit. If this amount is not sufficient, the letter of credit would be used, and finally CME would guarantee the remaining deficit, if any. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As of December 31, 2006, we did not have any significant off-balance sheet arrangements as defined by the regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. 66 Liquidity and Cash Management Cash and cash equivalents totaled $969.5 million at December 31, 2006 compared with $610.9 million at December 31, 2005. The balance retained in cash and cash equivalents was a function of anticipated or possible short-term cash needs, prevailing interest rates, our investment policy, alternative investment choices and any dividends that we pay. Current net deferred tax assets of $7.2 million and $6.4 million are included in other current assets at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, non-current net deferred tax assets, which are included in other assets, were $30.9 million and $8.5 million, respectively. Net deferred tax assets result primarily from depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation and pension costs. Under current tax laws, foreign net operating losses acquired from Swapstream of £4.2 million ($8.0 million as of December 31, 2006) may only be used to offset Swapstream’s future taxable income. Total accumulated net operating losses related to Swapstream were valued at $9.2 million as of December 31, 2006. Based on our assessment at December 31, 2006, we do not believe that we are more-likely-than-not to realize the value of acquired and accumulated foreign net operating losses in the future. As a result, the deferred tax benefit arising from these net operating losses has been fully reserved. Each clearing firm is required to deposit and maintain a specified performance bond balance, which is determined by parameters established by the risk management department of the clearing house and may fluctuate over time. Performance bond requirements can be satisfied with a variety of approved investments and cash. Cash performance bonds and security deposits are included in our consolidated balance sheets. With the exception of the portion of securities deposited that are utilized in our securities lending program, clearing firm deposits, other than those retained in the form of cash, are not included in our consolidated balance sheets. Securities lending transactions utilize a portion of the securities that clearing firms have deposited to satisfy their proprietary performance bond requirements. Securities lending activity fluctuates based on the amount of securities that clearing firms have deposited and the demand for securities lending activity in the particular securities available to us. As a result of these factors, the balances in cash performance bonds and security deposits as well as the balances in our securities lending program, may fluctuate significantly over time. Cash performance bonds and security deposits and collateral from securities lending consisted of the following at December 31: (in millions) 2006 2005 Cash performance bonds $ 506.0 $ 579.0 Cash security deposits 15.1 12.5 Cross-margin arrangements 0.1 0.6 Total Cash Performance Bonds and Security Deposits 521.2 592.1 Collateral from securities lending activities and payable under securities lending agreements 2,130.2 2,160.9 Total $ 2,651.4 $ 2,753.0 We are required under the Commodity Exchange Act to segregate cash and securities deposited by clearing firms on behalf of customers. In addition, our exchange rules require a segregation of all funds and securities deposited by clearing firms from exchange operating funds and marketable securities. As with cash performance bonds and security deposits, these balances will fluctuate due to the investment choices available to clearing firms and the change in total deposits required. Securities, at fair value, and IEF funds were deposited for the following purposes at December 31: (in millions) 2006 2005 Performance bonds $ 47,270.6 $ 45,809.8 Security deposits 1,250.5 1,236.2 Cross-margin arrangements 273.7 531.7 Total $ 48,794.8 $ 47,577.7 67 Cash Earnings Cash earnings, a non-GAAP measure, is the primary metric used by us to measure our financial performance. It is the basis for calculating dividends to shareholders and annual incentive payments to employees. It is calculated as net income plus depreciation and amortization expense, plus tax-effected stock-based compensation, including employee discounts on stock plan purchases, less capital expenditures. The cash earnings amount is calculated as follows (in millions): (in millions) 2006 2005 Net income $ 407.3 $ 306.9 Depreciation and amortization 72.8 64.9 Stock-based compensation, net of tax of $6.5 million and $5.0 million in 2006 and 2005, respectively 10.0 7.6 Capital expenditures (87.3 ) (87.6 ) Cash Earnings $ 402.8 291.8 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are subject to various market risks, including those caused by changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. Interest Rate Risk. Our investment policy is to preserve principal and liquidity while maximizing return through the investment of available funds. Investments typically include money market mutual funds, municipal securities, and U.S. Treasury and government agency securities with fixed or variable rate terms. Under our investment policy, we monitor interest rate risk by completing regular reviews of our marketable securities portfolio and its sensitivity to changes in the general level of interest rates, commonly referred to as a portfolio’s duration. We control the duration of the portfolio primarily through the purchase of individual marketable securities having a duration consistent with our overall investment policy. In addition, we will generally hold marketable securities to maturity, which will act as a further mitigating factor to interest rate risk. Under our investment policy, the aggregate portfolio duration cannot exceed 24 months. A change in market interest rates would affect interest income as well as the fair value of investments. All of our investments are carried at fair value. Interest income from short-term cash investments, marketable securities, and cash performance bonds and security deposits was $53.8 million and $28.5 million in 2006 and 2005, respectively. Our marketable securities portfolio experienced a decrease in net unrealized losses of $2.1 million in 2006 and an increase in net unrealized losses of $2.1 million in 2005. There were no realized gains or losses from sales of marketable securities in either period. Expected maturities and interest coupon rates for marketable securities, all of which were fixed-rate securities, were as follows at December 31, 2006 (dollars in thousands): Year Principal Cash Flows Weighted Average Interest Rate 2007 $ 173,517 3.77 % 2008 80,410 2.34 Total $ 253,927 3.32 Fair Value $ 250,718 The 2008 expected maturities include $26.7 million in principal amount of zero coupon marketable securities. Excluding zero coupon securities, the 2008 weighted average interest rate would be 3.51% and the total weighted average interest rate would be 3.71%. 68 Foreign Exchange Risk. GFX engages primarily in the purchase and sale of our foreign exchange futures contracts on the CME Globex platform to provide additional liquidity in these products. GFX subsequently enters into offsetting transactions using futures contracts or spot foreign exchange transactions with approved counterparties in the interbank market to limit its market risk. Any potential impact on the earnings of GFX from a change in foreign exchange rates would not be significant. Net intraday position limits, which are established for each trader, totaled $12.0 million in aggregate notional value as of December 31, 2006. At December 31, 2006, GFX held futures positions with a notional value of $111.8 million, offset by a similar amount of spot foreign exchange positions. The notional value of futures positions at December 31, 2005 totaled $106.6 million. All positions are marked to market on a daily basis using our foreign exchange settlement prices, with resulting gain or loss reflected in other revenues. Net trading gains were $7.0 million and $7.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. 69",2023-12-30 20:16:29.098706

BUSINESS Overview CME Group is a combined entity formed by the 2007 merger of CME Holdings and CBOT Holdings and is the holding company of two futures exchanges: CME and CBOT. Highly Liquid Markets We offer the widest array of benchmark products available across all major asset classes, including futures and options on futures based on interest rates, equity indexes, foreign exchange, agricultural commodities and alternative investments such as weather and real estate. The combined volume of CME and CBOT in 2007 exceeded 2.2 billion contracts. As of December 31, 2007, our open interest stood at 54.0 million contracts and our open interest record was 75.2 million contracts set on August 9, 2007. Open interest is the number of outstanding contracts at the close of the trading day and is a leading indicator of liquidity. Market liquidity, or the ability of a market to absorb the execution of large purchases or sales quickly and efficiently, is key to attracting customers and contributing to a market’s success. Most Diverse Product Line We serve the risk-management needs of customers around the globe, offering the widest range of benchmark products available on any exchange and covering all major asset classes. Our products provide a means for hedging, speculation and asset allocation relating to the risks associated with, among other things, interest rate sensitive instruments, equity ownership, changes in the value of foreign currency and changes in the prices of commodities. These include products based on the entire U.S. interest rate yield curve, equity indexes, foreign exchange, agricultural and industrial commodities, energy and alternative investment products. Futures and options provide a way to protect against – and potentially profit from – price changes in financial instruments and physical commodities. Futures contracts are legally binding agreements to buy or sell something in the future, such as livestock or foreign currency. The buyer and seller of a futures contract agree on a price today for a product to be delivered and paid for in the future. Each contract specifies the quantity of the item and the time of delivery or payment. An option on a futures contract is a right, but not an obligation, to sell or buy a futures contract at a specified price on or before a certain expiration date. Our customer base includes professional traders, financial institutions, institutional and individual investors, major corporations, manufacturers, producers and governments. Superior Trading Technology Our CME Globex electronic trading platform is accessible virtually 24 hours a day throughout the trading week. In January 2008, we completed the integration of CBOT’s interest rate, equity and agricultural electronic products on to CME Globex. Our six telecommunication hubs in key financial centers in Europe and Asia provide customers across the globe with reduced connectivity costs and fast, efficient access to our electronic markets via the CME Globex platform. Global Reach We offer a number of programs and products designed specifically to appeal to a global audience. Customers from all over the world trade our products, primarily electronically. Additionally, in 2007 we targeted strategic partnerships with a global focus as discussed in more detail below under “Growth Strategy – Globalizing the Business.” Financial Safeguards We own our own clearing house – CME Clearing. Ownership of our clearing house enables us to more quickly and efficiently bring new products to market through coordination of our clearing functions with our product development, technology, market regulation and other risk management activities. Our integrated clearing function is designed to ensure the safety and soundness of our markets. CME Clearing protects the financial integrity of our markets by serving as the counterparty to every trade – becoming the buyer to each seller and the seller to each buyer – and limiting credit risk. It is responsible for settling trading accounts, clearing trades, 5 Table of Contents collecting and maintaining performance bond funds, regulating delivery and reporting trading data. CME Clearing limits accumulation of debt from trading losses with twice daily mark-to-market settlement. As of December 31, 2007, we acted as custodian for approximately $59.9 billion in performance bond collateral. Performance bonds are a good-faith deposit that represents the minimum amount of protection against potential losses. History CME was founded in 1898 as a not-for-profit corporation. In November 2000, CME demutualized and became a shareholder-owned corporation. As a consequence, we adopted a for-profit approach to our business, including strategic initiatives aimed at optimizing trading volume, efficiency and liquidity. In December 2002, CME Holdings completed its initial public offering of its Class A common stock and became the first U.S. financial exchange to be publicly traded. In July 2007, CME Holdings completed its historic merger with CBOT Holdings. As a result, we acquired CBOT. Founded in 1848, CBOT is the world’s leading marketplace for trading agricultural and U.S. Treasury futures as well as options on futures. Our principal executive offices are located at 20 South Wacker Drive, Chicago, Illinois 60606, and our telephone number is 312-930-1000. Growth Strategy Increased market awareness and acceptance of derivatives, increased volatility, technological advances and reduced regulatory barriers offer significant opportunities for growth. We believe that we can capitalize on these trends and build on our competitive strengths by implementing the following strategies: • growing the core business; • penetrating the over-the-counter market; • leveraging our transaction processing services; • leveraging our technology; • advancing new business opportunities; and • globalizing the business. Growing the Core Business. We intend to advance our position as a leader in the futures industry by generating organic growth through launching new products. We have a strong track record of innovation, continually launching new products and product line extensions. In 2007, our new products and product extensions included: • Lehman Brothers U.S. Aggregate Index • Dow Jones U.S. Real Estate Index futures • E-mini S&P SmallCap 600 and E-mini S&P Midcap 400 options • S&P/GRA Commercial Real Estate indexes • Weekly foreign exchange options • Hurricane futures and options • MSCI Emerging Markets Index futures • Dry whey futures • Options on ethanol futures • Wood pulp futures and options • 30-year Interest Rate Swap futures • Credit event futures We plan to continue to work with existing and potential customers to develop new futures and options products that provide an array of relevant risk management tools. 6 Table of Contents Penetrating the Over-the-Counter Market. We intend to continue our initiatives to expand our business into over-the-counter markets by developing over-the-counter products and services and by entering these markets through acquisitions and strategic partnerships. In response to the rapid increase in popularity of foreign exchange as an asset class and the advances in electronic trading, we formed a joint venture with Reuters Group PLC (Reuters) to create the first centrally cleared, global over-the-counter foreign exchange marketplace — FXMarketSpace Limited (FXMS), launched in March 2007. This strategic relationship complements our foreign exchange futures and options products and represents an opportunity for us to expand into the over-the-counter foreign exchange marketplace. Swapstream is a global, over-the-counter electronic trading platform for interest rate swaps that we acquired in 2006. It offers products that provide dealers with the flexibility to interact with one or more banks, one or more brokers, or any combination of these to build their own marketplace and distribute their liquidity. The platform also features a sophisticated permission-based system that allows market participants to publish customized prices and pricing curves based on both credit and counterparty considerations. We plan to launch CME Swaps on the Swapstream platform in the first half of 2008. CME Swaps on Swapstream are the first interest rate swaps that offer the full benefits of central counterparty clearing to the over-the-counter marketplace. Combining the strengths of CME Clearing360, our over-the-counter clearing services, and Swapstream’s trading technology is evidence of our broader strategy of providing greater operational and cost efficiencies to trading standard over-the-counter products. Additionally, CBOT began offering ethanol swap products which trade over-the-counter and are cleared by CME Clearing360. Since their launch in 2006, more than 60,000 contracts total have traded with open interest in excess of 20,000 contracts. Leveraging Our Transaction Processing Services. Providing third-party transaction processing, clearing and related services is a key element of our strategy. We believe there are opportunities to expand our service offerings and further diversify our revenue streams. In 2007, we generated $106.4 million in revenues (including $48.2 million from services provided to CBOT prior to our merger) from our transaction processing services. It accounted for 6% of total revenues. Effective in June 2006, we became the exclusive electronic trading service provider for the NewYork Mercantile Exchange’s (NYMEX) energy futures and options contracts and for metals products listed on its COMEX Division. This relationship accounted for $56.4 million of our processing services revenue in 2007. We also have an agreement with the Brazilian Mercantile & Futures Exchange S.A. (BM&F) discussed below in more detail under “Globalizing the Business.” It includes an order-routing arrangement in which our CME Globex distribution network would be connected to BM&F’s distribution network. As a result of the merger with CBOT Holdings, we also list the products of the Minneapolis Grain Exchange and the Kansas City Board of Trade for trading on the CME Globex platform. We have a fast, widely distributed and reliable derivatives trading platform in CME Globex, and we have a world class clearing house. Our goal is to offer processing services to our partners, enhancing their ability to grow. Our relationships with CBOT and NYMEX evidence our ability to leverage the scalable infrastructure we have built. Leveraging Our Technology. Technology remains a key component of our growth strategy. Our goal is to leverage our technology, distribution and transaction processing. We made significant enhancements to improve the speed, functionality and reliability of our CME Globex platform. In 2007, we upgraded all match engines to improve performance during periods of peak activity. CME Globex handled an average daily volume of 6.0 million contracts in 2007 (including average daily volume of 0.8 million NYMEX contracts), with an all-time record of 14.2 million contracts (13.1 million for CME Group and 1.1 million for NYMEX) on August 16, 2007. Following the integration of CBOT products onto CME Globex, our all time record was 19.5 million transactions (18.3 million for CME Group, including CBOT contracts, and 1.2 million for NYMEX) on January 22, 2008. CME Globex has handled a peak order transaction load of 230 million orders and sent out a peak market data load of 163 million messages in a day. Advancing New Business Opportunities. In July 2007, we completed our historic merger with CBOT Holdings. Our combined company creates operational and cost efficiencies for our customers. The merger has allowed us to leverage each company’s distinct product lines for the benefit of customers around the world. In January 2008, we successfully migrated CBOT’s electronic commodities, equity index and interest rate products onto the CME Globex trading platform. In the second quarter of 2008, we will consolidate the trading floors of the two exchanges to our 141 West Jackson Boulevard location in Chicago. In 2007, we achieved expense savings of $26.2 million. We expect annual expense savings of more than $100 million in 2008. The bulk of the synergies will result from reducing technology and administrative costs, and creating more efficient trading floor operations. Staff reductions of 380 existing and open positions will be complete by mid-2008. 7 Table of Contents Globalizing the Business. Our goal is to expand and diversify our customer base worldwide and to offer customers around the world the most broadly diversified portfolio of benchmark products. We also seek to deploy our technology and transaction processing services globally. In 2007, we continued to deliver on this strategic initiative, working with the Korea Exchange and the China Foreign Exchange Trading System, among others. On February 26, 2008, we completed our transaction with BM&F for the purchase of a ten percent equity interest in BM&F in exchange for approximately a two percent interest in CME Group. The transaction includes an order-routing arrangement in which our CME Globex electronic distribution network will be connected to BM&F’s distribution network. The arrangement is exclusive to CME for order-routing services provided to BM&F outside of China, Mexico, Central and South America and exclusive to BM&F among exchanges in Central and South America. We also are contemplating additional initiatives with BM&F, including enabling BM&F to become a “super-clearing” member of CME Group and establishing a joint working group to explore opportunities to develop and market new products for the Brazilian and Latin American markets. Also in 2007, we entered into a non-binding letter of intent with the Korea Exchange for a proposed agreement to list the KOSPI 200 futures on the CME Globex platform during non-Korean trading hours. The proposed five-year agreement would include the creation of a telecom hub in Seoul and would represent the first time the Korea Exchange has entered into a processing agreement relating to its KOSPI product line. We believe this arrangement represents an important step in our expansion into Asia, which is a vital area of long-term growth potential for us. We will continue to explore opportunities to position CME Group to benefit from growth in key geographies through strategic investments, and to capitalize on opportunities in Asia and Latin America by leveraging our diverse product offerings. Products We believe that the range and diversity of our products contribute significantly to our success. We offer markets in futures and options on futures contracts based on the U.S. interest rate yield curve, equity indexes, foreign exchange, agricultural and industrial commodities, energy and alternative investment products. Our products are traded through the CME Globex electronic trading platform, our open outcry auction markets or through privately negotiated transactions that we clear. For the year ended December 31, 2007, we derived $1.4 billion, or 81% of our total revenues, from fees associated with trading and clearing our products. These fees include per contract charges for trade execution, clearing and CME Globex fees. Fees are charged at various rates based on the product traded, the method of trade and the trading privileges of the customer making the trade. Generally, members are charged lower fees than non-members. Certain of our customers benefit from volume discounts and limits on fees as part of our efforts to encourage increased liquidity in our markets. Our markets also generate valuable data and information regarding pricing and trading activity in our products. We identify new products by monitoring economic trends and their impact on the risk management and speculative needs of our existing and prospective customers. See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” page 59, for the average daily volume of contracts traded in our four principal product lines for the last two years. Interest Rate Products. Our interest rate products enable banks and other financial institutions worldwide to hedge interest rate risks, and in turn help to reduce the overall cost of borrowing and financing. Our interest rate products allow our customers to execute transactions across the entire U.S. dollar-denominated yield curve using some of the world’s most actively traded futures and options products. Customers may manage short-, medium- and long-term interest rate risk using our products based on Eurodollars, U.S. Treasuries, swaps and other dollar-related instruments. As a result of our acquisition of CBOT, our interest rate products include CBOT’s thirty-year U.S. Treasury bond futures and options on futures and ten-year, five-year and two-year U.S. Treasury note futures and options. We also offer CME Credit Index Event Contracts, the first exchange-traded, centrally cleared and guaranteed product available in the U.S. credit derivatives market. Beginning in the fourth quarter, we added futures and options products based on the Lehman Brothers U.S. Aggregate Index, the preeminent benchmark debt index for U.S. investment-grade fixed income securities. 8 Table of Contents Sixty percent of our overall annual trading volume in 2007 was based upon our interest rate products. The overall volume of our interest rate product line was up 73% compared to 2006 primarily due to our merger with CBOT Holdings. We intend to increase our revenues from our interest rate product sector by leveraging cross marketing opportunities between CME and CBOT interest rate products, enhancing electronic liquidity in existing interest rate futures and options products, and extending into the execution and clearing of over-the-counter U.S. dollar and non-dollar interest rate derivative products through our launch of CME Swaps on Swapstream. Equity Products. Our equity products permit investors to obtain exposure, for hedging or speculative purposes, to a change in the weighting of one or more equity market sectors more efficiently than by buying or selling the underlying securities. By allowing investors to effectively manage stock market risks, our equity products increase investor confidence and overall participation in these important markets. We are a leading equity index marketplace, offering futures and options products on key benchmark equity indexes covering small-, medium- and large-cap companies in the U.S., Europe and Asia. These include the Standard & Poor’s, Dow Jones, NASDAQ, Nikkei, MSCI and FTSE/Xinhua indexes, and others. We have exclusive licensing arrangements with Standard & Poor’s Corporation (S&P), The Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc. (NASDAQ) and Dow Jones & Company, Inc. (Dow Jones), which allow us to offer futures and options on futures on their indexes, including our contracts based on the S&P 500 Index, the NASDAQ-100 Index and the Dow Jones Industrial Average. For a detailed description of these licensing arrangements, see the section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K entitled “Item 1. Business—Licensing Agreements.” We also offer E-mini contracts, which trade exclusively on our CME Globex platform and are one-fifth the size of their standard counterparts. These products are designed to address the growing demand for equity derivatives and electronically traded products. Our total trading volume for equity products rose 53% in 2007, to 667.9 million contracts. Trading in these products represented 30% of our total trading volume during 2007. We believe our leading market position in equity products is a result of the liquidity of our markets, the status of the S&P 500, the NASDAQ-100 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average indexes as the principal U.S. financial standards for benchmarking stock market returns, and the appeal to investors and traders of our E-mini products and other equity products and our CME Globex platform. These investors include public and private pension funds, investment companies, mutual funds, insurance companies and other financial services companies that benchmark their investment performance to different segments of the equity markets. We believe future growth in our equity products will come from expanding customer access to our electronic markets and enhancing the functionality of our CME Globex electronic platform to increase the electronic trading volume of our options on futures contracts as well as further educating the global marketplace on the benefits of these products. Foreign Exchange Products. We became the first exchange to introduce financial futures when we launched foreign exchange futures in 1972. Our foreign exchange market serves as an effective and efficient means of risk transfer for the global foreign exchange market, bringing together a broad array of client segments by offering investment as well as risk management opportunities. Our customers benefit from dealing anonymously in a fully transparent market, where large and small customers have equal access to the same prices and deep pool of liquidity. Our foreign exchange products provide the tools and resources to hedge foreign exchange risk, facilitating cross-border trade and commerce while mitigating the risks to profitability due to fluctuations in the foreign exchange market. Our foreign exchange market attracts both buy- and sell-side investors, including commercial and investment banks, hedge funds, commodity trading advisors, proprietary trading firms and individual investors. Approximately 92% of our foreign exchange products are traded electronically on the CME Globex platform, ensuring that business is transacted quickly with maximum operational efficiency. Today, we offer approximately 40 foreign exchange futures and approximately 30 foreign exchange options on futures products, covering major as well as a broad array of emerging market currency pairs in the following currencies: Euro, Japanese yen, British pound, Swiss franc, Canadian dollar, Australian dollar, New Zealand dollar, Mexican peso, Brazilian real, Norwegian krone, Swedish krona, Czech koruna, Hungarian forint, Polish zloty, Russian ruble, South African rand, Israeli shekel, Korean won, and Chinese renminbi. 9 Table of Contents In 2007, we saw an average daily volume of 569,000 foreign exchange contracts per day, with a notional value of $70.9 billion a day. Our total foreign exchange trading volume increased 27% in 2007, with a total of 144.0 million contracts traded during the year. Trading in our foreign exchange products represented 6% of our total trading volume in 2007. In 2007, electronically traded foreign exchange volume increased 33% over 2006 to 132.5 million contracts. Open outcry trading decreased 33% to 3.9 million contracts in 2007. We believe future growth in our foreign exchange product line will come from expanding and diversifying our product suite and customer base. For example, trading in volatility-based options on six of our foreign exchange options will begin in March 2008. We are expanding our foreign exchange options product suite to appeal to a broader array of customer segments, and we expect continued strong growth in the electronic execution of foreign exchange options on CME Globex in 2008. As we expand our global footprint in the foreign exchange market, we expect increased trading volume from customers outside of the United States. Commodity and Alternative Investment Products. Our commodity products help establish benchmark prices and play an important role in risk management for the agricultural community. These products provide hedging tools for our customers who deal in tangible physical commodities, including agricultural producers of commodities and food processors. Commodity products were our only products when our exchange first opened for business. We have maintained a strong franchise in our commodity products, including futures contracts based on cattle, hogs, pork bellies, lumber and dairy products and, now as a result of our acquisition of CBOT, have added contracts based on soybeans, corn, wheat, oats, rough rice, gold and silver. We also provide our customers with non-traditional, alternative investment products to diversify and manage their risk. Our real estate products provide opportunities for protection in up and down markets, and extend to the real estate industry the same financial tools that our previous innovations have brought to agriculture and finance. By providing a means of hedging exposure to real estate prices, customers can diffuse the potential impact of sustained declines in real estate prices. Our ethanol products offer a way for ethanol producers, ethanol marketers and gasoline refiners to limit alternative fuel price risk in a highly volatile, growing market faced with mounting regulatory and market pressures. We also are the only regulated exchange that offers risk management products on the weather market through our weather contracts based on aggregate temperatures in 35 cities around the world as well as hurricane, snowfall and frost indexes. Commodity and alternative investment products accounted for 4% of our trading volume during 2007. We continue to execute our strategy of growing our customer base and providing side-by-side access to our commodity markets. We believe the changing perception of commodities as an asset class provides an opportunity for growth in our markets. Market Data and Information Products. Our markets generate valuable information regarding prices and trading activity in our products that we believe enhances the trading activity in our products. The dissemination of real-time data generates revenues and supports our customer base with timely market information. We sell our market data, which includes information about bids, offers, trades and trade size in our products, to banks, broker-dealers, pension funds, investment companies, mutual funds, insurance companies, individual investors and other financial services companies or organizations that use our markets or monitor general economic conditions. We distribute our market data directly to our electronic trading customers as part of their access to our markets through our electronic facilities. We also distribute market data via dedicated networks to quote vendors who consolidate our market data with that from other exchanges, other third party data providers and news services, and then resell their consolidated data. Revenues from market data products totaled $145.1 million, or 8% of our total revenues, in 2007. Sophisticated quantitative approaches to risk management as well as customer time sensitivity have created new needs, uses and demands for trading-related data and analytics. We continue to enhance our current market data and information product offerings by creating new value-added services to complement our market data products, including databases, analytical tools and other services to assist end-users. In October 2007, we launched our new Market Data Protocol named FIX/FAST. FIX/FAST is the most recent step in our strategy to improve market data offerings in response to customer requests for faster and more efficient distribution of data. Combined with last year’s change to the Market Data Platform dissemination method, customers now have the latest technology available for obtaining our market information and prices. As part of our market data and information products business, we also supply services to S&P and OneChicago, our joint venture with the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc. (CBOE) and Interactive Brokers Group, in connection with the usage reporting, contract administration and associated billing and revenue collection for the display and integration of their market data into our standard market data distribution. We are also the exclusive distributor of Dow Jones Index data. 10 Table of Contents Execution Our primary trade execution facilities consist of our CME Globex electronic trading platform and our open outcry trading floors. Both of these execution facilities offer our customers immediate trade execution and price transparency and are supported by substantial infrastructure and technology for order routing, trade reporting, market data dissemination and market surveillance and regulation. In addition, trades can be executed through privately negotiated transactions that are cleared and settled through our clearing house. Electronic Trading. Our CME Globex electronic trading platform maintains an electronic, centralized order book and trade execution algorithm for futures contracts and options on futures contracts and allows users to enter orders directly into the order book. In January 2008, we completed the migration of CBOT’s agricultural, interest and equity products to the CME Globex platform. CBOT metals products continue to trade on e-CBOT, powered by LIFFE CONNECT. In 2007, 77% of our total trading volume was executed electronically, compared with 71% in 2006. During 2007, approximately 77% of our clearing and transaction fees revenue was derived from electronic trading. Additionally, we offer the ability to trade the U.S. dollar-, British pound-, euro- and Swiss franc-denominated medium-term and long-term interest rate swaps and spread trades on the Swapstream platform. Open Outcry Trading. We also offer our members the ability to execute transactions in an open-auction format on our trading floors—a centralized meeting place for traders and floor brokers to trade our products. Orders by market participants not physically located on the trading floor are communicated to floor brokers. Current market information and news are displayed on wallboards hung above the trading pits. Following the merger with CBOT Holdings, we operate two separate trading floors for trading CME and CBOT products. In the second quarter of 2008, we will integrate the CME and CBOT trading floors at one location at 141 W. Jackson Boulevard in Chicago. Open outcry trading represented 21% of our total trading volume in 2007 and accounted for approximately 16% of our clearing and transaction fees revenue. Privately Negotiated Transactions. In addition to offering traditional open outcry and electronic trading through the CME Globex platform, we permit qualified customers to trade our products by entering into privately negotiated transactions, which are reported and included in the market data we distribute. We also clear, settle and guarantee these transactions through our clearing house. Some market participants value privately negotiated transactions as a way to ensure that large transactions can be completed at a single price or in a single transaction while preserving their ability to effectively complete a hedging, risk management or other trading strategy. During 2007, approximately 7% of our clearing and transaction fees revenue was derived from this type of trading. Clearing We operate our own clearing house—CME Clearing—that clears, settles and guarantees the performance of all transactions matched through our execution facilities and on third party exchanges for which we provide clearing services. Up until the closing of the merger with CBOT Holdings, we provided clearing services to CBOT. Ownership and control of our own clearing house enables us to retain the revenue associated with both the trading and clearing of our products. By owning our clearing house, we also control the cost structure and the technology development cycle for our clearing services. It helps us manage our new product initiatives without being dependent on an outside entity. It also benefits our customers by creating operational, risk management and product benefits. Additionally, owning our own clearing house allows us to generate additional revenue by providing clearing services to other exchanges. In February 2007, we began clearing over-the-counter foreign exchange products for FXMS and we provide clearing services for OneChicago. In 2007, our clearing house cleared an average of 11.0 million contracts daily and 2.8 billion contracts overall, which includes contracts cleared for CBOT prior to the closing of the merger in July. As of December 31, 2007, our open interest stood at 54.0 million contracts and our open interest record was 75.2 million contracts set on August 9, 2007. As of December 31, 2007, we acted as custodian for approximately $59.9 billion in performance bond collateral deposited by our clearing firms and, during 2007, we moved an average of approximately $2.2 billion a day in settlement funds through our clearing system. In June 2007, the United Kingdom’s Financial Services Authority granted CME the status of a Recognised Overseas Clearing House, which enables us to provide global clearing services to market participants in the United Kingdom and serve a wider range of those customers’ risk management needs. In addition, our clearing house guarantees the performance of all our contracts with a financial safeguards package of approximately $5.2 billion (as of January 1, 2008). 11 Table of Contents The clearing function provides three primary benefits to our markets: efficient, high-volume transaction processing; cost and capital efficiencies; and a reliable credit guarantee. The services we provide can be broadly categorized as follows: • transaction processing and position management; • market protection and risk management; • settlement, collateral and delivery services; and • cross-margining and mutual offset services; • investment services. Transaction Processing and Position Management. Our CLEARING 21 system developed with NYMEX in the early 1990s processes reported trades and positions on a real-time basis, providing users with instantaneous information on trades, positions and risk exposure. CLEARING 21 is able to process trades in futures and options products, securities and cash instruments. CLEARING 21 can also support complex new product types, including combinations, options on combinations, options on options, swaps, repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements, and other instruments. Through CLEARING 21 user interfaces, our clearing firms can electronically manage their positions, exercise options, enter transactions related to foreign exchange deliveries, manage collateral posted to meet performance bond requirements and access all of our other on-line applications. Together with our order routing and trade matching services, we offer straight-through electronic processing of transactions in which an order is electronically routed, matched, cleared and made available to the clearing firm’s back-office systems for further processing. Market Protection and Risk Management. Our clearing house guarantee of performance is a significant attraction, and an important part of the functioning of our exchange. Because of this guarantee, our customers do not need to evaluate the credit of each potential counterparty or limit themselves to a selected set of counterparties. This flexibility increases the potential liquidity available for each trade. Additionally, the substitution of our clearing house as the counterparty to every transaction allows our customers to establish a position with one party and then to offset the position with another party. This contract offsetting process provides our customers with flexibility in establishing and adjusting positions and provides for performance bond efficiencies. In order to ensure performance, we establish and monitor financial requirements for our clearing firms. We also set minimum performance bond requirements for our traded products. Our clearing house uses our proprietary CME SPAN software, which determines the appropriate performance bond requirements by simulating the gains and losses of complex portfolios. We typically hold performance bond collateral to cover at least 95% of price changes for a given product within a given historical period. At each settlement cycle, our clearing house values, at the market price prevailing at that time, or marks-to-market, all open positions and requires payments from clearing firms whose positions have lost value and makes payments to clearing firms whose positions have gained value. Our clearing house marks-to-market all open positions at least twice a day, and more often if market volatility warrants. Marking-to-market provides both participants in a transaction with an accounting of their financial obligations under the contract. Having a mark-to-market cycle of a minimum of two times a day helps protect the financial integrity of our clearing house, our clearing firms and market participants. This allows our clearing house to identify quickly any clearing firms that may not be able to satisfy the financial obligations resulting from changes in the prices of their open contracts before those financial obligations become exceptionally large and jeopardize the ability of our clearing house to ensure performance of their open positions. This transparency makes it difficult for traders to hide losses or disguise unusual profits. 12 Table of Contents In the unlikely event of a payment default by a clearing firm, we would first apply assets of that clearing firm to cover its payment obligation. These assets include security deposits, performance bonds and any other available assets, such as the proceeds from the sale of Class A common stock and trading rights (at CME and/or CBOT, as applicable) of the clearing firm and the Class B common stock for CME clearing firms owned by or assigned to the clearing firm. In addition, we would make a demand for payment pursuant to any applicable guarantee provided to the exchange by the parent of a clearing firm. Thereafter, if the payment default remains unsatisfied, we would use our surplus funds, security deposits of other clearing firms and funds collected through an assessment against all other solvent clearing firms to satisfy the deficit. We maintain a committed $800 million 364-day revolving line of credit with a consortium of banks. We have the option to increase the facility from $800 million to $1 billion, subject to approval by the participating banks. We are required to post additional collateral in connection with any such increase. This line of credit may also be utilized if there is a temporary disruption with the domestic payments system that would delay settlement payments between our clearing house and clearing firms. The credit agreement requires us to pledge clearing firm security deposits held by us in the form of U.S. Treasury or agency securities, as well as security deposit funds in our second Interest Earning Facility program (IEF2) to the line of credit custodian prior to drawing on the line. Performance bond collateral of a defaulting clearing firm may also be used to secure a draw on the line. Settlement, Collateral and Delivery Services. We manage final settlement in all of our contracts, including cash settlement, physical delivery of selected commodities, and option exercises and assignments. Because some initial and maintenance performance bonds from clearing firms, as well as mark-to-market obligations on some of our contracts, are denominated in various foreign currencies, we offer multi-currency performance bond and settlement services. Generally, although more than 95% of all futures contracts are liquidated before the expiration of the contract, the underlying financial instruments or commodities for the remainder of the contracts must be delivered. We act as the delivery agent for all contracts, ensuring timely delivery by the seller of the exact quality and quantity specified in a contract and full and timely payment by the buyer. We also facilitate final settlement on a daily basis for cash foreign exchange transactions with FXMS. To administer its system of financial safeguards efficiently, our clearing house has developed banking relationships with a network of major U.S. banks and banking industry infrastructure providers, such as the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications. Among the key services provided to our clearing house by these banks and service providers are a variety of custody, credit and payment services that support the substantial financial commitments and processes backing the guarantee of our clearing house to market participants. Cross-Margining and Mutual Offset Services. Cross-margining arrangements reduce capital costs for clearing firms and customers. These agreements permit an individual clearing house to recognize a clearing firm’s open positions at other participating clearing houses, and clearing firms are able to offset risks of positions held at one clearing house against those held at other participating clearing houses. This arrangement reduces the need for collateral deposits by the clearing firm. For example, our cross-margining program with the Options Clearing Corporation reduced performance bond requirements for our members by approximately $3.0 billion a day in 2007. We have implemented cross-margining arrangements with NYMEX, the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation and LCH.Clearnet Group for positions at the London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange that are cleared through LCH.Clearnet Group. In addition, our mutual offset agreement with the Singapore Derivatives Exchange allows a clearing firm of either exchange initiating trades in certain products on either exchange to execute after-hours trades at the other exchange in those products and then transfer them back to the originating exchange. This mutual offset arrangement enables firms to execute trades at either exchange virtually 24 hours per day. This arrangement has been in place since 1984 and was renewed in October 2006 for an additional three year term with automatic renewals for one year each unless terminated by either party. Investment Services. In order to achieve collateral efficiencies for our clearing firms, we have established a number of collateral programs under the designation Interest Earning Facility (IEF). Under this program, our clearing firms may select from four different IEF programs to meet their individual needs. The programs are designed to enable our clearing firms to make optimal use of the demand deposit cash accounts and security accounts they have established to satisfy our performance bond requirements. We earn fee income in return for providing these value-added services to our clearing firms. 13 Table of Contents Our clearing house launched a securities lending program in 2001 using a portion of certain securities deposited to meet the proprietary performance bond requirements of our clearing firms. Under this securities lending program, we lend a security to a third party and receive collateral in the form of cash. The majority of the cash is then invested on an overnight basis to generate interest income. The related interest expense represents payment to the borrower of the security for the cash collateral retained during the duration of the lending transaction. Securities on loan are marked-to-market daily and compared to collateral received. Technology Our operation of both electronic and open outcry trading facilities and a clearing house has influenced the design and implementation of the technologies that support our operations. Trading Technology. We have a proven track record of operating successful electronic and open outcry markets by developing and integrating multiple, evolving technologies that support a growing and substantial trading volume. The integrated suite of technologies we employ to accomplish this has been designed to support a significant expansion of our current business and provides us with an opportunity to leverage our technology base into new markets, products and services. As electronic trading activity expands, we continue to provide greater match engine functionality unique to various markets, market models and product types. We have adopted a modular approach to technology development and engineered an integrated set of solutions that support multiple specialized markets. We continually monitor and upgrade our capacity requirements. Our goal is to design our systems to handle at least one and a half times our historical peak transactions in our highest volume products. Significant investments in production planning, quality assurance and certification processes have enhanced our ability to expedite the delivery of the system enhancements that we develop for our customers. In 2007, we were focused on the planning and implementation of the migration of CBOT products onto the CME Globex platform. This migration was completed in January 2008 with the exception of CBOT metals products which will continue to trade on e-CBOT through mid-July 2008. We will continue to need to expand and upgrade our technology and systems to respond to increases in trading volume and order transaction traffic. Speed, reliability, scalability, capacity and functionality are critical performance criteria for electronic trading platforms. A substantial portion of our operating budget is dedicated to system design, development and operations in order to achieve high levels of overall system performance. In 2007, we continued our efforts to grow and enhance our electronic trading capabilities. We also maintain remote data facilities to provide additional system capacity and redundancy for our trading and clearing technology. Our data centers support our customer interfaces, trading and execution systems, as well as clearing and settlement operations. The technology systems supporting our trading operations can be divided into five major categories: Distribution Technologies that support the ability of customers to access our trading systems from terminals through network access to our trading floor and/or electronic trading environments. Order routing/order management Technologies that control the flow of orders to the trading floor or electronic trading systems and that monitor the status of and modify submitted orders. Trade matching (electronic market) Technologies that aggregate submitted orders and electronically match buy and sell orders when their trade conditions are met. Market data Technologies that distribute order information to our end user customers on our market data platform. Trading floor operations Technologies that maximize market participants’ ability to capitalize on opportunities present in both the trading floor and electronic markets that we operate. 14 Table of Contents The CME Globex electronic trading platform includes the distribution, order routing, order management, trade matching and market data technology. CME Globex’s modularity and functionality enable us to selectively add products with unique trading characteristics onto the trading platform. The distribution technologies we offer differentiate our platform and bring liquidity and trading volume to our execution facilities. As of December 31, 2007, we had more than 1,100 direct connections with our systems for customers across the globe. Many of these customers connect through a dedicated private network that is readily available, has wide distribution and provides fast connections in the Americas, Europe and Asia. We have telecommunications hubs in Amsterdam, Dublin, London, Milan, Paris and Singapore to respond to customer requests and reduce the cost of trading for our foreign customers. In 2007, we closed the hub in Gibraltar. We plan to add hubs in Seoul, Sao Paulo and Shanghai. We plan to add distribution for BM&F products in 2008. In order routing and management, we offer a range of mechanisms and were among the first U.S. derivatives exchanges to implement the FIX protocol—the standard order routing protocol used within the securities industry. In addition, our order routing and order management systems are capable of supporting multiple electronic trading match engines. This functionality gives us great latitude in the types of markets that we choose to serve. Several key technology platforms and standards are used to support these activities, including fault-tolerant Hewlett Packard Integrity NonStop servers that incorporate Intel Itanium processors, IBM mainframes, Microsoft software, Hitachi and EMC Storage Area Network (SAN equipment), Sun Microsystems and Hewlett Packard servers, Oracle and DB2 databases, LINUX, UNIX, Novell, TIBCO middleware and multi-vendor network solutions. Our futures match engine is based upon the computerized trading and match software known as the NSC system. We have a fully trained development team that maintains, upgrades and customizes our version of the NSC system. The customized enhancements that we have developed address the unique trading demands of each marketplace that we serve. We continue to focus on performance features of the match engine. In 2007, we upgraded all match engines to improve performance during periods of peak activity. Our options match engine was designed and built at CME with focus on the speed of matching buy and sell orders and fault tolerance for 24-hour trading. We work on continuous enhancements to build a fully-functional electronic marketplace for options where our customers can offset their risk with as much ease as in our open outcry trading facilities. We also offer user-defined functionality for customers to create and trade customized spreads of instruments. Over the last three years we have made significant investments in market data technologies to support increased trading and messaging volumes. Enhancements include performance improvements, scalability with a new multicast distribution platform, and a FIX 5.0 compliant messaging format. These implementations benefit our customers through reducing required bandwidth, costs, and improved performance. Our merger with CBOT Holdings will allow us to incorporate their floor technologies into our combined operations. These technologies facilitate side-by-side trading and provide enhanced pit trading capabilities. Clearing Technology. CLEARING 21, our clearing and settlement software, and CME SPAN, our margining and risk management software, form the core of our clearing technology. CLEARING 21 is a system for high-volume, high-capacity clearing and settlement of exchange-based transactions that we developed jointly with NYMEX in the early 1990s. The system offers clearing firms improved efficiency and reduced costs. CLEARING 21’s modular design gives us the ability to rapidly introduce new products. The software can be customized to meet the unique needs of specialized markets. CME SPAN is our sophisticated margining and risk management software. CME SPAN has now been adopted by more than 50 exchanges and clearing organizations worldwide. This software simulates the effects of changing market conditions on a complex portfolio and uses standard options pricing models to determine a portfolio’s overall risk. CME SPAN then generates a performance bond requirement that typically covers 95% of price changes within a given historical period. 15 Table of Contents Building Services As a result of our merger with CBOT Holdings, we now own and manage three buildings, with over 1.5 million square feet of commercial space in the aggregate, in the central business district of Chicago. As of December 31, 2007, the buildings were about 90% occupied, with approximately 32% of the total space used by us. In September 2007, we began renovations on the CBOT trading floor in connection with the migration of the CME trading floors from 20 South Wacker Drive to 141 West Jackson Boulevard in Chicago, which is expected to occur beginning in April 2008. Tenants pay market rates for rent. The majority of tenant leases have terms of three to five years, with large tenants generally having leases for up to nineteen years. As of December 31, 2007, the largest tenant, other than us, leased approximately 8% of the rentable area and the next five largest tenants leased about 18% of the rentable area. We manage both the real estate and the general services relating to such real estate such as cleaning, power and telephone services through our wholly-owned subsidiary, C-B-T Corporation. Building services generated about 1% of our total revenues in 2007. CBOT previously spent considerable resources so that all three buildings have advanced electrical, mechanical and telecommunications infrastructure and services. The demographics of the tenants of our commercial space have begun to widen beyond traditional brokerage/trading service firms to include other financial services firms, which we believe is due to the location and desirable electrical, telecommunications and mechanical infrastructure of our buildings. We expect additional tenants who previously leased space at 10 and 30 South Wacker Drive to move to 141 West Jackson in connection with the migration of the CME trading floors. In 2004, a proposal was approved by the Chicago City Council re-designating the property-tax classification for the landmark building at 141 W. Jackson in Chicago as “Class L” in order to provide assistance in connection with renovations. The Class L classification is expected to lower our property taxes by about $14 million over 12 years, beginning with our 2008 real estate taxes payable in 2009. The reduction in property tax assessments associated with the Class L designation is available to owners renovating landmark buildings. The north facade and lobby of the 141 W. Jackson building have been city landmarks since 1977, but a separate ordinance extended protected status to all four facades. As part of the Class L incentive, we agreed to a major renovation of the North Building consisting of the renovation and cleaning of the façade, a full elevator modernization, renovation of the lobby and various other aesthetic and infrastructure improvements. Business Continuity Planning We continue to strengthen and upgrade our disaster recovery facilities and capabilities. We have dedicated significant resources to improve our continuity planning. For example, our disaster recovery infrastructure and activities include: • Formal disaster recovery testing conducted twice a year at each of our data centers. • Network disaster recovery testing conducted monthly. • Participation in an annual industry-wide disaster recovery test sponsored by the Futures Industry Association. Additionally, in order to ensure proper coordination during a potential crisis, we have established relationships with the local business community, law enforcement, and local and regional governmental emergency agencies. Strategic Relationships We continually review our growth strategy and whether it is in the interests of our shareholders to engage in discussions with other parties regarding various strategic acquisitions, partnerships, divestitures and other arrangements and alliances. 16 Table of Contents The following is a summary of our key strategic relationships. BM&F. On February 26, 2008, we completed our transaction with BM&F for the purchase of a ten percent equity stock in BM&F in exchange for approximately two percent stake in CME Group. The transaction includes an order-routing arrangement in which our CME Globex electronic distribution network will be connected to BM&F’s distribution network. The arrangement is exclusive to us for order-routing services provided to BM&F outside of China, Mexico, Central and South America and exclusive to BM&F among exchanges in Central and South America. CFETS. In March 2006, we entered into an agreement for order routing and super clearing with the China Foreign Exchange Trade System and National Interbank Funding Center (CFETS) pursuant to which CFETS would become a super clearing member. Final implementation of the arrangement is subject to regulatory approval. NYMEX. On April 6, 2006, we entered into a definitive technology services agreement with NYMEX pursuant to which we became the exclusive electronic trading service provider for NYMEX’s energy futures and options contracts and for metals products listed on its COMEX Division. The agreement has a ten-year term from the launch date with rolling three-year extensions unless either party elects not to renew the agreement upon written notice prior to the beginning of the applicable renewal term. For our services, we receive a minimum annual payment or per trade fees on CME Globex based on average daily volume, whichever is greater. During the term of the agreement, we are prohibited from listing products on CME Globex that are competitive contracts (as defined in the agreement) to the NYMEX products that are listed on the CME Globex platform provided minimum trading volumes are met. NYMEX remains responsible for clearing its contracts listed on CME Globex and for the performance of all related regulatory oversight functions. The agreement may be terminated for certain reasons, including by either party between the fifth and sixth year anniversary of the first launch date upon written notice and payment of a termination fee or in the event of an acquisition of a competitor or the listing of competitive products by us. In 2007, NYMEX contracts averaged 757,000 per day on the CME Globex platform. Reuters. In May 2006, we entered into an agreement with Reuters to create FXMS, the first centrally-cleared, global foreign exchange marketplace, through a joint venture owned 50% each by CME Holdings and Reuters. We provide the joint venture with trade matching, central counterparty clearing and market regulation services. Reuters provides the joint venture with graphical user interface access, data distribution and trade notification services. FXMS offers market solutions to capitalize on the growing demand for broader access to the foreign exchange market, the emergence of foreign exchange as an asset class, the growth of non-bank financial institutions in global foreign exchange markets and the growth of electronic and algorithmic trading. FXMS operates alongside existing electronic transactional systems including Reuters Dealing 3000 for interbank trading, Reuters Trading for Foreign Exchange for dealer to buy-side connectivity and our foreign exchange futures and options markets on our CME Globex platform. Singapore Derivatives Exchange Ltd. In October 2006, we renewed our mutual offset agreement with the Singapore Derivatives Exchange for an additional three-year term. This relationship allows a clearing firm of either exchange initiating trades in certain products on either exchange to execute after-hours trades at the other exchange in those products, then transfer them back to the originating exchange. We also currently have memoranda of understanding with several key global markets to meet increased demands for our products including the Taiwan Futures Exchange, Shanghai Stock Exchange and the Korea Exchange. These memoranda of understanding generally provide for the exchange of information about listing new products, changes to existing contract specifications and trading methods. As a result of the merger with CBOT Holdings, we also list the products of the Minneapolis Grain Exchange and the Kansas City Board of Trade on the CME Globex platform and act as their sole distributor of market data. Marketing Programs and Advertising Our marketing programs align our core business objectives and product line goals with positioning, messaging and customer targeting strategies designed to increase awareness and use of our products. The marketing strategy and tactics include conducting market research to gather customer insight, and the implementation of our marketing campaigns, which may include online and print advertising, direct marketing, public relations, online marketing and educational programs. Our marketing programs primarily target institutional customers and, to a lesser extent, individual traders. Our marketing programs for institutional customers aim to inform traders, portfolio managers, corporate treasurers and other market professionals about novel uses of our products, such as new hedging and risk management strategies. We also strive to educate these users about changes in product design, performance bond requirements and new clearing services. We participate in major domestic and international trade shows and seminars regarding futures contracts and options on futures contracts and other derivatives products. In addition, we sponsor educational workshops and marketing events designed to educate market users about our products. Through these relationships and programs, we attempt to understand the needs of our customer base and use information provided by them to drive our product development efforts. 17 Table of Contents Our advertising strategies seek to increase awareness and strengthen perceptions of CME Group among our institutional and retail customers, as well as support an increase in our trading volume. In September 2006, we launched a new global brand advertising campaign. The print campaign, “Smart People, Great Results,” prominently features testimonials from some of our leading global customers – fund managers, financial advisors and professional traders – showing how our benchmark futures and options products improve the way markets work and enable them to achieve positive financial results. Our primary method of advertising has been through print media, utilizing trade magazines and newsletters as well as daily business publications. However, we also use on-line, television sponsorship and other direct advertisements to reach our target audiences. Our marketing program includes CME Magazine, a quarterly publication designed to keep our customers up-to-date on developments that can enhance their successful participation in the derivatives industry. The magazine features customer case histories, new product information, technology updates, trend stories and news briefs and is made available on our Web site. Competition The industry in which we operate is highly competitive and we expect competition to continue to intensify. We encounter competition in all aspects of our business, including from entities having substantially greater capital and resources and offering a wider range of products and services and some operating under a different and possibly less stringent regulatory regime. Prior to the passage of the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000 (CFMA), futures trading was required to take place on, or subject to the rules of, a federally designated contract market. The costs and difficulty of obtaining contract market designation and corresponding regulatory requirements created significant barriers to entry for competing exchanges. The passage of the CFMA and other changing market dynamics have led to increasing competition from a number of different domestic and international sources of varied size, business objectives and resources. We now face competition from other futures, securities and securities option exchanges; over-the-counter markets; clearing organizations; consortia formed by our members and large market participants; alternative trade execution facilities; technology firms, including market data distributors and electronic trading system developers; and others. Competition in our Derivatives Business We believe competition among exchanges in the derivatives and securities business is based on a number of factors, including, among others: • depth and liquidity of markets; • transaction costs; • breadth of product offerings and rate and quality of new product development; • transparency, reliability and anonymity in transaction processing; • connectivity; • technological capability and innovation; • efficient and secure settlement, clearing and support services; and • reputation. We believe that we compete favorably with respect to these factors, and that our deep, liquid markets; diverse product offerings; rate and quality of new product development; and efficient, secure settlement, clearing and support services distinguish us from our competitors. We believe that in order to maintain our competitive position, we must continue to expand globally; develop new and innovative products; enhance our technology infrastructure, including its reliability and functionality; and maintain liquidity and low transaction costs. 18 Table of Contents Over the past few years there have been significant changes in the industry’s landscape as a result of the wave of consolidation and increased competition. For example, during the past two years, in addition to our merger with CBOT Holdings, the following consolidations occurred: • NYSE Group acquired Archipelago Exchange and then subsequently merged with Euronext • IntercontinentalExchange acquired the New York Board of Trade and the Winnipeg Commodity Exchange • Deutsche Borse acquired the International Securities Exchange At the end of 2007, there were 60 futures exchanges located in 33 countries, including 11 exchanges in the United States. Additionally, in the last three months there has been an increase in activity among derivative dealers, banks and other entities to form competing exchanges. In December 2007, a consortium of 12 financial institutions announced their intention to form an exchange – referred to as Project Four Seasons – and Project Rainbow was recently formed to discuss launching a European derivatives exchange. Project Four Seasons has stated their intention to offer futures products that would be similar to our interest rate products. The existence of these consortiums may increase competitive pressure on us. Because equity futures contracts are alternatives to underlying stocks and a variety of equity option and other contracts provide an alternative means of obtaining exposure to the equity markets, we also compete with NYSE Euronext and other securities and options exchanges, dealer markets and alternative trading systems in this product line. Over-the-counter markets for foreign exchange and fixed-income derivatives products also compete with us. The largest foreign exchange markets are operated primarily as electronic trading systems. Two of the largest of these, operated by Electronic Brokering Services and Reuters, serve primarily professional foreign exchange trading firms. Additional electronic platforms designed to serve corporate foreign exchange users have emerged. Two of these are operated by consortia of interdealer and interbank market participants. A third is a proprietary trading system. In addition, certain provisions of the CFMA have led to an increase in unregulated electronic and brokerage trading systems in the foreign exchange market. The over-the-counter, fixed-income derivatives market is by far the largest fixed-income derivatives marketplace. The over-the-counter market consists primarily of interbank and interdealer market participants. There is currently no single liquidity pool in the over-the-counter fixed-income derivatives market that is comparable to our Eurodollar market. The over-the-counter market for fixed-income derivatives products has traditionally been limited to more customized products, and the large credit exposures created in this market and the absence of clearing facilities have limited participation to the most creditworthy institutional participants. However, the size of this market and technology-driven developments in electronic trading and clearing facilities, as well as regulatory changes implemented by the CFMA, increase the likelihood that one or more substantial liquidity pools will emerge in the future in the over-the-counter fixed-income derivatives market. Alternative trade execution facilities that currently specialize in the trading of equity securities have electronic trade execution and routing systems that also can be used to trade products that compete with our products. We also face a threat of trading volume loss if a significant number of our traditional participants decide to trade futures or similar products among themselves without using any exchange or specific trading system. The CFMA allows nearly all of our largest customers to transact futures or similar products directly with each other. While those transactions raise liquidity and credit concerns, they may be attractive based on execution costs, flexibility of terms, negotiability of margin or collateral deposits, or other considerations. Additionally, changes under the CFMA permitting the establishment of stand-alone clearing facilities for futures and over-the-counter derivatives transactions will facilitate the mitigation of credit-risk concentrations arising from such transactions. 19 Table of Contents Competition in our Transaction Processing Business In addition to the competition we face in our derivatives business, we face a number of competitors in our transaction processing and other business services, including: • other exchanges and clearing houses seeking to leverage their infrastructure; and • technology firms, including front-end developers, back-office processing systems firms and match-engine developers. In the past few years, there has been increased competition in the provision of clearing services. We compete with other derivatives exchanges that provide clearing services as well as with some of our largest customers who are part of clearing organizations. For example, in December 2007, the Clearing Corporation (CCorp) completed a corporate restructuring resulting in ownership of CCorp by 17 stockholders, including 12 major global dealers, three leading inter-dealer brokers and Eurex. In addition to continuing to provide traditional clearing services to multiple exchanges and marketplaces, the reconstituted CCorp has stated that it will expand its product line to include a centralized clearing facility for a number of over-the-counter derivatives products. We believe that other exchanges may also undertake to provide clearing services. We believe competition in the transaction processing and business services market is based on, among other things, the cost of the services provided; quality and reliability of the services; timely delivery of the services; reputation; and value of linking with existing products, markets and distribution. Competition in our Market Data Business Technology companies, market data and information vendors and front-end software vendors also represent potential competitors because, as purveyors of market data, these firms typically have substantial distribution capabilities. As technology firms, they also have access to trading engines that can be connected to their data and information networks. Additionally, technology and software firms that develop trading systems, hardware and networks that are otherwise outside of the financial services industry may be attracted to enter our markets. This may lead to decreased demand for our market data. Regulatory Matters Our operations are subject to extensive regulation by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) under the Commodity Exchange Act. The Commodity Exchange Act generally requires that futures trading in commodities be conducted on a commodity exchange designated as a contract market by the CFTC. The act establishes non-financial criteria for an exchange to be designated to list futures and options contracts. Designation as a contract market for the trading of a specified futures contract is non-exclusive. This means that the CFTC may designate additional exchanges as contract markets for trading the same or similar contracts. The CFMA created a flexible regulatory framework for us in our capacity as a CFTC registrant, and eliminated many prescriptive requirements of the Commodity Exchange Act and CFTC in favor of more broad and flexible core principles. For instance, CFTC-regulated exchanges may now list new contracts and adopt new rules without prior CFTC approval under self-certification procedures, permitting timelier product launch and modification. 20 Table of Contents For regulated markets, the CFMA created a three-tiered regulatory structure. The degree of regulation is related to the characteristics of the product and the type of customer that has direct or indirect access to the market, with retail customer markets being subject to greater regulation. The three-tiered regulatory structure is as follows: • designated contract markets with retail customer participation are subject to the highest level of regulation; • derivatives transaction execution facilities with access limited to institutional traders and others trading through members that meet specified capital and other requirements and products limited to contracts that are less susceptible to manipulation (including single stock futures) are subject to a lesser degree of regulation; and • exempt boards of trade subject to the least regulation are characterized by products without cash markets or that are highly unlikely to be susceptible to manipulation and by the participation only of institutional traders and others that meet specified asset requirements. Our existing market, which trades a broad range of products and permits intermediaries to represent unsophisticated customers, is subject to the most thorough oversight as a designated contract market. The CFMA permits us to organize markets that are subject to lesser regulation depending on the types of products traded and the types of traders. Markets can be organized that trade only products that are unlikely to be susceptible to manipulation and permit direct trading only among institutional participants in order to achieve a less intrusive degree of oversight. For example, we were able to launch Swapstream as an “exempt board of trade” under the CFMA. We have also “notice registered” with the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) as a special purpose national securities exchange solely for the purpose of trading security futures products. As a result, the SEC is authorized to review some of our rules relating to these security futures products. Our members trading those products are subject to registration requirements and duties and obligations to customers under the securities laws that do not pertain to their other futures business. The CFMA also provides for regulation of derivatives clearing organizations (DCO) like our clearing house, separately from the exchanges for which they clear contracts and permits DCOs to clear a range of over-the-counter traded products in addition to products traded on an exchange. The CFMA requires a DCO that clears for a registered futures exchange to register with the CFTC. However, our clearing house was deemed to be registered by reason of its activities prior to enactment of the CFMA. Our clearing house is required to comply with a separate set of flexible core principles that specifically apply to clearing houses. A DCO may accept for clearing any new contract or may adopt any new rule or rule amendment by providing to the CFTC a written certification that the new contract, rule or rule amendment complies with the Commodity Exchange Act. Alternatively, the DCO may request that the CFTC grant prior approval to any contract, rule or rule amendment, and the CFTC must grant approval within 75 days unless the CFTC finds that the proposed contract, rule, or rule amendment would violate the Commodity Exchange Act. CME and CBOT are separate self-regulatory organizations responsible for ensuring market integrity and financial security for all transactions in their products although CBOT outsources responsibility for trade matching, regulatory and clearing services to CME. Our integrated compliance and market surveillance functions allow detailed tracking of all trading and clearing activities. In addition, our markets are subject to oversight by the CFTC. Our regulatory processes are reviewed and audited by the CFTC. Demutualization and the increasing utilization of electronic trading systems by traders from remote locations may, among other developments, impact our ability to continue the traditional form of “self-regulation” that has been an integral part of the CFTC regulatory program. On February 1, 2007, the CFTC issued recommendations as to an appropriate means for designated contract markets to comply with the core principle requiring self-regulatory organizations to mitigate potential conflicts of interest. The recommendations require at least 35% of the board of directors of a designated contract market to be directors with no material relationship with the exchange, including memberships on the exchange. The CFTC has not promulgated an effective date for and is currently reviewing its recommendations. As a result of our merger, our Board of Directors is now comprised of 30 members of which nine have no industry affiliation other than service on our Board. We have not yet completed our assessment as to whether such directors would be considered to have no material relationship with the exchange for purposes of the CFTC recommendation. To the extent we are not in compliance, we will be required to demonstrate to the CFTC how we otherwise meet the requirements of the core principle. 21 Table of Contents The safe harbor also requires that such exchanges have in place a regulatory oversight committee comprised solely of non-industry directors. In April 2004, we became the first futures exchange to appoint a board-level committee devoted to self-regulatory oversight. The Committee is called the Market Regulation Oversight Committee and is comprised solely of independent, non-industry directors. The committee provides independent oversight of the policies and programs of our Market Regulation Department to ensure effective administration of our exchanges’ self-regulatory responsibilities. From time to time it is proposed in Congress that federal financial markets regulators should be consolidated, including a possible merger between the CFTC and the SEC. For example, in 2007, the U.S. Department of the Treasury solicited comments as part of its evaluation of the regulatory structure associated with financial institutions. While those proposals have not been adopted to date and the Department of the Treasury has not released any recommendations from its study, the perceived convergence of product lines offered on the securities and commodity exchanges could make adoption more likely. To the extent the regulatory environment following such consolidation is less beneficial for us, our business, financial condition and operating results could be negatively affected. The CFMA excluded or exempted many of the activities of our non-exchange competitors from regulation under the Commodity Exchange Act. The CFMA created broad exclusions and exemptions from the Commodity Exchange Act that permit derivatives contracts, which may serve the same or similar functions as the contracts we offer, to be sold in the largely unregulated over-the-counter market, including through electronic trading facilities. Additionally, the CFMA permits SEC-regulated and bank clearing organizations to clear a broad array of derivatives products in addition to the products that clearing organizations have traditionally cleared. The CFMA also permits banks and broker-dealers, and some of their affiliates, to offer and sell foreign exchange futures to retail customers without being subject to regulation under the Commodity Exchange Act. The CFTC’s authorization expired in 2005; however, reauthorization was not concluded and will continue through the 2008 legislative session. As part of that process, various concepts were mentioned as possible areas in which legislation would be appropriate. While we are unaware of any legislative proposal at the present time arising from the reauthorization that would materially affect our business, any such proposal may be introduced during this process. Additionally, from time to time, including in 2008, the proposed Presidential budget has included a proposal to impose a transaction tax on futures traded domestically. While many participants in the futures industry, including us, vigorously oppose this proposal, we cannot guarantee that such proposal will not be enacted, which may adversely impact our ability to compete on an international level. Our Members As a result of our merger with CBOT Holdings, we now operate two separate self-regulatory exchanges: CME and CBOT. Individuals may be members at one or both exchanges to trade our products. Members are individual traders, as well as most of the world’s largest banks, brokerages and investment houses. Trading on our open outcry trading floors is conducted exclusively by members. Members can execute trades for their own accounts, for clearing firm accounts, for the accounts of other members or for the accounts of customers of clearing firms. Members who trade for their own account, including those who lease trading rights, qualify for lower transaction fees in recognition of the market liquidity that their trading activity provides. These members also benefit from market information advantages that may accrue from their proximity to activity on the trading floors. Generally, member customers are charged lower fees than our non-member customers. In 2007, our members were responsible for 80% of our total trading volume. As of December 31, 2007, there were approximately 120 clearing firms. Membership applicants planning to access the trading floor are subject to a review and approval process prior to becoming members and obtaining trading rights. Membership in an exchange entitles members to appear on the floor of the exchange during business hours and act as a floor broker and/or floor trader executing trades in the contracts that are eligible within their membership division at the exchange. Applicants for membership are required to be of good moral character, reputation and business integrity. They must also have adequate financial resources and credit to assume the responsibilities and privileges of membership. All members must understand the rules and regulations of the applicable exchange and agree to abide by them. Additionally, they must comply with the provisions of the Commodity Exchange Act and the rules and regulations issued by the CFTC. 22 Table of Contents Our Market Regulation Department is the investigative and enforcement arm of our exchanges with regard to exchange rules. Members who are found to have violated a rule can be subject to sanctions such as fines, trading suspensions and/or expulsion from the particular exchange. Our Shareholder Relations and Membership Services Department maintains an auction market for trading rights at CME and CBOT. CME Memberships There are four divisions of membership at CME: the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) division; the International Monetary Market (IMM) division; the Index and Option Market (IOM) division; and the Growth and Emerging Markets (GEM) division. Each membership division has different trading rights. We have individual trading members, corporate equity or trading member firms and clearing member firms. Under the terms of CME Group’s certificate of incorporation, members of the CME exchange, as Class B shareholders, have the ability to protect their rights to trade by means of special approval rights over changes to the operation of the markets and are entitled to elect six of the 30 directors on our Board. In particular, the certificate of incorporation grants the holders of our Class B common stock the right to approve any changes to the trading floor rights, access rights and privileges that a member has, the number of memberships in each membership class and the related number of authorized shares in each class of Class B common stock and the eligibility requirements to exercise trading rights or privileges. Class B shareholders must approve any changes to these special rights. Class B shares have the same equitable interest in our earnings and receive the same dividend payments as our Class A shares. CBOT Memberships There are five series of Class B memberships in CBOT represented by memberships in our CBOT subsidiary: Series B-1 (Full) members, Series B-2 (Associate) members, Series B-3 (GIM) members, Series B-4 (IDEM) members and Series B-5 (COM) members. Class B members of CBOT do not possess the right to receive any dividends or distributions, including the proceeds from liquidation, from CBOT. Series B-1 and B-2 members have the right to vote on amendments to certain provisions of the certificate of incorporation of CBOT, including the number of authorized memberships; the relative voting rights of the Series B-1 and B-2 members; the trading rights, voting rights and core rights of Class B members and certain other covenants; and the commitment to maintain open outcry markets. Additionally, during the five-year period following the merger, we are required to provide the CBOT directors, as defined in the bylaws, with five business days’ advance notice of any change to CBOT’s rules and regulations. If a majority of the CBOT directors determine in their sole discretion that the proposed change will materially impair the business of CBOT or the business opportunities of the holders of the Class B memberships of CBOT, such change will be submitted to a committee of the board of directors of CBOT comprised of three CBOT directors and two CME directors as defined in the bylaws. Subsidiaries Substantially all of our business operations are conducted through our exchange subsidiaries: CME and CBOT. The following is a summary of the activities of our other operating subsidiaries: C-B-T Corporation. C-B-T Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary of CBOT, manages both our owned real estate and the general services relating to such real estate such as cleaning, power and telephone services. Our real estate holdings accounted for 1% of our consolidated total revenues in 2007. CME Alternative Marketplace Inc. CME Alternative Marketplace Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of CME, was established as an exempt board of trade registered with the CFTC. CME economic derivatives were the only products traded through this subsidiary. In July 2007, we discontinued CME economic derivatives. CME Alternative Marketplace accounted for less than 1% of our consolidated total revenues in 2007 and 2006. 23 Table of Contents GFX Corporation. GFX Corporation (GFX), a wholly-owned subsidiary of CME, was established for the purpose of maintaining and creating liquidity in our electronically traded foreign exchange futures contracts. Experienced foreign exchange traders employed by GFX buy and sell our foreign exchange contracts using our CME Globex system. They limit risk from these transactions through offsetting transactions using forward contracts and spot foreign exchange transactions with approved counterparties in the interbank market. On occasion, GFX has also engaged in the trading of CME Eurodollars and equity index contracts. GFX accounted for less than 1% of our consolidated total revenues in 2007, 2006 and 2005. Swapstream Subsidiaries. In August 2006, we completed the acquisition of Swapstream, an inter-dealer electronic trading platform for euro- and Swiss franc-denominated interest rate swaps. In connection with the transaction, we created a wholly-owned subsidiary, CME Swaps Marketplace Ltd., a U.K. limited liability company, which acquired 100% of the outstanding stock of the following Swapstream entities: Special Technology Investments Limited, Swapstream Limited, Swapstream Operating Services Limited and Swapstream France. The Swapstream entities accounted for less than 1% of our consolidated total revenues in 2007 and 2006. Licensing Agreements Standard & Poor’s We have had a licensing arrangement with S&P since 1980. In September 2005, all of our previous licensing agreements with S&P were consolidated into one agreement that terminates on December 31, 2017. Under the terms of the agreement, as amended, S&P granted us a license to use certain S&P stock indexes and the related trade names, trademarks and service marks in connection with the creation, marketing, trading, clearing and promoting of futures contracts and/or options on futures contracts that are indexed to certain S&P stock indexes. The license is exclusive through December 31, 2016 and non-exclusive from that date through December 31, 2017 with some exceptions. Our license for the S&P 500 Index remains exclusive through December 31, 2008, after which we will retain our exclusive rights through December 31, 2016 so long as certain minimum average trading volume is met or other circumstances exist that relate to the reduction in trading volume. We may pay an additional fee to retain the exclusivity if the minimum average trading volume is not met. For certain products based on S&P stock indexes that we list after the effective date of the amended and restated agreement, we will have an exclusive license for two or three years depending upon the nature of the index, after which we will retain our exclusive rights so long as certain minimum average trading volumes are met. Under the agreement, we maintain our right of first refusal for new stock indexes developed by S&P during the term of the agreement. S&P also retains the right to terminate the license based on new S&P stock indexes or to terminate the exclusivity of that license in the event we fail to launch a product based on the index within a one-year period, subject to some consideration for regulatory delays. In exchange for the license, we pay S&P a per trade fee. If S&P discontinues compilation and publication of any license or index, we may license, on a non-exclusive and royalty-free basis, the information regarding the list of companies, shares outstanding and divisors for that index or terminate the obligations regarding the index. The licenses become non-exclusive in the event we list certain competitive products. NASDAQ We have had a licensing arrangement with NASDAQ since 1996 to license the NASDAQ-100 Index and related trade names, trademarks and service marks. The license was extended and expanded in October 2003 to license us both the NASDAQ-100 Index and the NASDAQ Composite Index and in April 2005 to add the NASDAQ Biotechnology Index for trading futures and options on futures contracts that are based on the indexes. Our license for these indexes was automatically renewed in October 2007 through October 2011. With respect to the NASDAQ Composite Index, NASDAQ may terminate the exclusivity or the entire license if trading volume fails to meet certain performance criteria on each anniversary of the agreement in October. During the applicable period of exclusivity, NASDAQ will not grant a license to use the indexes in connection with the trading, marketing and promotion of futures contracts and options on those futures contracts that are based on an index that is exclusive to us. We pay per trade fees to NASDAQ under the license. We have a right of first refusal for new NASDAQ indexes that are licensed for futures products where the index is substantially equivalent to an index licensed to us or is a subset of an index licensed to us. 24 Table of Contents Dow Jones License Agreement We have a licensing agreement with Dow Jones to license certain Dow Jones stock indexes and the related trade names, trademarks and service marks in connection with the creation, marketing, trading, clearing and promoting of futures contracts and/or options on futures contracts that are based upon such Dow Jones stock indexes. Our license of the Dow Jones Composite Index, the Dow Jones Industrial Average Index, the Dow Jones Transportation Average Index and the Dow Jones Utility Average Index is exclusive, and non-exclusive for the Dow Jones U.S. Real Estate Index. We also have a right of first refusal for new indexes developed by Dow Jones prior to December 31, 2010 and the right to sublicense our exclusive license rights under the agreement to any other exchange for the trading of futures contracts and options on futures contracts. The initial term of the agreement is from January 1, 2008 through December 31, 2014. Following the initial term, the agreement shall automatically renew for a first renewal term of five years and then for successive annual renewal terms thereafter unless terminated by either party in writing prior to the end of the applicable term. In exchange for the license, we pay a per trade fee with a guaranteed annual minimum license fee and an upfront fee paid in January 2008. The Frank Russell Company We have maintained a licensing arrangement with the Frank Russell Company since 1992 to license the Russell 2000 Index and related trade names, trademarks and service marks. In June 2007, Russell provided notice to us that it did not intend to renew the agreement. In response to customer demands and to ensure an orderly transfer of liquidity, we intend to list our Russell contracts through the September 2008 expiration date. We and S&P are providing trading incentives and execution facilities that will encourage market participants to transfer their open interest in CME Russell 2000 stock index futures contracts into the new CME/S&P E-mini Small Cap Stock Index futures contracts. NSC In January 2008, we entered into an agreement with Euronext Paris to expand our rights to the NSC software which we originally used pursuant to a license agreement. We now own outright the rights to use, modify, and create derivative works of the NSC software. We are, however, restricted from licensing the software to unaffiliated entities for five years. This restriction does not apply to the use of the software to provide transaction processing services to such entities. In consideration for the ownership of these rights, we paid a one-time fee and granted Euronext Paris comparable rights to their version of our CLEARING 21 system. Intellectual Property We regard substantial elements of our brand name, marketing elements and logos, products, market data, software and technology as proprietary. We attempt to protect these elements by relying on trademark, service mark, copyright and trade secret laws, restrictions on disclosure and other methods. For example, with respect to trademarks, we have registered marks in numerous countries all over the world. We have filed numerous patent applications in the United States and internationally to protect our technology. On December 19, 2006, the United States Patent and Trademark Office granted CME its first patent. Our rights to stock indexes for our futures products principally derive from license agreements that we have obtained from S&P, NASDAQ and Dow Jones and others. For a more detailed discussion of these licenses, see the section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K entitled “Item 1. Business—Licensing Agreements.” We regularly review our intellectual property to identify property that should be protected, the extent of current protection for that property and the availability of additional protection. We believe our various trademarks and service marks have been registered or applied for where needed. We also seek to protect our software and databases as trade secrets and under copyright law. We have copyright registrations for certain of our software, user manuals, and databases. Legal developments allowing patent protection for methods of doing business hold the possibility of additional protection, which we are pursuing. Patents of third parties may have an important bearing on our ability to offer certain of our products and services. It is possible that, from time to time, we may face claims of infringement that could interfere with our ability to use technology or other intellectual property that is material to our business. 25 Table of Contents Employees As of December 31, 2007, we had 1,970 employees. Effective December 23, 2007, all employees of CBOT and C-B-T Corporation who were continuing employment with CME Group in 2008 were transferred to employment with CME. We consider relations with our employees to be good. We have never experienced a work stoppage. Forty-two of our employees are represented by one of the following unions: • Chicago Regional Council of Carpenters; • International Union of Operating Engineers Local 399, AFL-CIO; and • Service Employees International Union, SEIU Local 1 and 25, AFL-CIO. We also employ six engineers who are associated with the International Union of Operating Engineers, Local 399, AFL-CIO but are not subject to a collective bargaining agreement.

RISK FACTORS In addition to the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating us and our business. Risks Relating to Our Business Shareholders who own trading rights or are officers or directors of firms who own trading rights on our exchanges account for 20 of the 30 directors on our Board. These shareholders may have interests that differ from or conflict with those of shareholders who are not also members. Our dependence on the trading and clearing activities of our members, combined with their rights to elect directors, may enable them to exert substantial influence over the operation of our business. Twenty of our 30 directors on our Board own or are officers or directors of firms who own trading rights on our exchange. We are dependent on the revenues from the trading and clearing activities of our members. This dependence may give them substantial influence over how we operate our business. Many of our members and clearing firms derive a substantial portion of their income from their trading or clearing activities on or through our exchanges. In addition, trading rights on our exchanges have substantial independent value. The amount of income that members derive from their trading, brokering and clearing activities and the value of their trading rights are, in part, dependent on the fees they are charged to trade, broker, clear and access our markets and the rules and structure of our markets. Our trading members, many of whom act as floor brokers and floor traders, benefit from trading rules, membership privileges and fee discounts that enhance their open outcry trading opportunities and profits. Our predominantly electronic trading members benefit from fee discounts and other incentives targeted at increasing electronic trading volume. These benefits enhance their electronic trading opportunities and profits. Our clearing firms benefit from all of the foregoing, as well as decisions that increase electronic trading, which over time will reduce their costs of doing business on our exchanges. As a result, holders of our Class A common stock may not have the same economic interests as our members. In addition, our members may have differing interests among themselves depending on the role they serve in our markets, their method of trading and the products they trade. Consequently, members may advocate that we enhance and protect their clearing and trading opportunities and the value of their trading privileges over their economic interest in us. The Board representation rights of the members of our CME exchange to elect six directors, in combination with the charter provision protections described in the immediately following risk factor, could be used to influence how our business is changed or developed, including how we address competition and how we seek to grow our volume and revenue and enhance shareholder value. Our members have been granted special rights, which protect their trading rights, require that we maintain open outcry trading until volumes are not significant and, in the case of our Class B shareholders, provide them with special Board representation. Under the terms of the certificates of incorporation of CME Group and CBOT, our members have the ability to protect their rights to trade on the respective exchange by means of special approval rights over changes to the operation of our trading floor, including whether we are required to maintain open outcry trading of a particular product. Our Class B shareholders, who are members of our CME exchange, are also entitled to elect six of the 30 directors on our Board, even if their Class A share ownership interest is very small or non-existent. The certificates of incorporation of CME Group and CBOT also include provisions requiring us to maintain open outcry floor trading for a particular traded product as long as the open outcry market is “liquid.” We are also required to maintain a facility for conducting business, disseminating price information, clearing and delivery and to provide reasonable financial support for technology, marketing and research for open outcry markets. These certificates of incorporation provide specific tests as to whether an open outcry market will be deemed liquid, as measured on a quarterly basis. If a market is deemed illiquid as a result of a failure to meet any of these tests, our Board may determine whether such market should be closed. 28 Table of Contents Additionally, we are required until our 2012 annual meeting to provide advance notice to the ten members of our Board who were formally directors of CBOT Holdings prior to the merger or their successors of any changes to CBOT exchange rules, except for certain limited administrative changes. If a majority of the CBOT directors decide that the proposed rule change would materially impair the CBOT business or materially impair the business opportunities of the CBOT members, then the proposed rule change must be submitted to a committee comprised of three CBOT directors and two directors who were directors of CME Holdings prior to the merger or their successors for final approval. Our business is subject to the impact of domestic and international market and economic conditions, which are beyond our control and which could significantly reduce our trading volumes and make our financial results more volatile. We generate revenues primarily from our clearing and transaction fees and our processing services provided to third parties. We expect to continue to do so for the foreseeable future. Each of these revenue sources is substantially dependent on the trading volume in our markets and in the markets we provide processing services. Our trading volume is directly affected by U.S. domestic and international factors that are beyond our control, including: • economic, political and geopolitical market conditions; • natural disasters and other catastrophes; • broad trends in industry and finance; • changes in price levels and volatility in the derivatives markets and in underlying fixed-income, equity, foreign exchange and commodity markets; • legislative and regulatory changes; • competition; • changes in government monetary policies; • consolidation in our customer base and within our industry; and • inflation. Any one or more of these factors may contribute to reduced activity in our markets. Our operating results and trading volume tend to increase during periods of uncertainty. This is because our customers seek to hedge or manage the risks associated with or speculate on volatility in the U.S. equity markets, fluctuations in interest rates and price changes in the foreign exchange, commodity and other markets. The future economic environment may be subject to periodic downturns, including possible recession and lower volatility in financial markets, and may not be as favorable as it has been in recent years. For example, recent events in the economic environment, including the sub-prime lending crisis, the downturn in the housing market and decreases in consumer spending, may result in an economic recession in the near future. As a result, period-to-period comparisons of our financial results are not necessarily meaningful. Trends less favorable than those of recent periods could result in decreased trading volume and a more difficult business environment for us. Material decreases in trading volume would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results. Our cost structure is largely fixed. If our revenues decline and we are unable to reduce our costs, our profitability will be adversely affected. Our cost structure is largely fixed. We base our cost structure on historical and expected levels of demand for our products and services. If demand for our products and services and our resulting revenues decline, we may not be able to adjust our cost structure on a timely basis. In that event, our profitability will be adversely affected. 29 Table of Contents The success of our markets will depend on our ability to complete development of and successfully implement electronic trading systems that have the functionality, performance, reliability and speed required by our customers. The future success of our business depends in large part on our ability to create interactive electronic marketplaces in a wide range of derivatives products that have the required functionality, performance, capacity, reliability and speed to attract and retain customers. A significant portion of our current overall volume is generated through electronic trading on our CME Globex electronic platform. However, during 2007, 21% of our volume and approximately 16% of our clearing and transaction fees revenue was generated through our open outcry trading facilities. Most of our open outcry volume is related to trading in options on our futures contracts. Our electronic functionality may not be capable of accommodating all of the complex trading strategies typically used for trading options on futures contracts. For example, 92% of our Eurodollar options contracts are traded via open outcry despite our initiatives to implement advanced functionality. We intend to continue to introduce functionality that will accommodate complex trading strategies electronically. However, we may not complete the development of, or successfully implement, the required electronic functionality for our options on futures contracts. Moreover, our customers who trade options may not accept our electronic trading systems. In either event, our ability to increase trading volume of options on futures contracts on the CME Globex platform would be adversely affected. In addition, if we are unable to develop our electronic trading systems to include other products and markets, or if our electronic trading systems do not have the required functionality, performance, capacity, reliability and speed, we may not be able to compete successfully in an environment that is increasingly dominated by electronic trading. The enhancement of our electronic trading platform exposes us to risks inherent in operating in the evolving market for electronic transaction services. If we do not successfully continue to enhance our electronic trading platform, or if our customers do not accept it, our revenues and profits will be adversely affected. We must continue to enhance our electronic trading platform to remain competitive. As a result, we will continue to be subject to risks, expenses and uncertainties encountered in the rapidly evolving market for electronic transaction services. These risks include our failure or inability to: • provide reliable and cost-effective services to our customers; • develop, in a timely manner, the required functionality to support electronic trading in our key products in a manner that is competitive with the functionality supported by other electronic markets; • match fees of our competitors that offer only electronic trading facilities; • attract independent software vendors to write front-end software that will effectively access our electronic trading system and automated order routing system; • respond to technological developments or service offerings by competitors; and • generate sufficient revenue to justify the substantial capital investment we have made and will continue to make to enhance our electronic trading platform. If we do not successfully enhance our electronic trading platform, or our current or potential customers do not accept it, our revenues and profits will be adversely affected. If we are not able to keep up with rapid technological changes, our business will be materially harmed. To remain competitive, we must continue to improve the responsiveness, functionality, accessibility and other features of our software, network distribution systems and technologies. The markets in which we compete are characterized by rapidly changing technology, changes in customer demand and uses of derivatives products and transaction processing services, frequent product and service introductions embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards and practices that could render our existing technology and systems obsolete. Our future success will depend in part on our ability to anticipate and adapt to technological advancements and changing standards in a timely, cost-efficient and competitive manner. We cannot assure you that we will successfully implement new technologies or adapt our technology to customer and competitive requirements or emerging industry standards. 30 Table of Contents We face intense competition from other companies, including some of our members. If we are not able to successfully compete, our business will not survive. The derivatives, securities and financial services industries are highly competitive. We expect that competition will continue to intensify in the future. Our current and prospective competitors, both domestically and around the world, are numerous. They include securities and securities option exchanges, futures exchanges, over-the-counter markets, clearing organizations, market data and information vendors, electronic communications networks, crossing systems and similar entities, consortia of large customers, consortia of some of our clearing firms and electronic brokerage and dealing facilities. At December 31, 2007, there were 60 futures exchanges located in 33 countries, including 11 futures exchanges in the United States. The global derivatives industry has grown increasingly competitive. Exchanges, intermediaries, and even end users are consolidating, and over-the-counter and unregulated entities are constantly evolving. Additionally, in response to growing competition, many marketplaces in both Europe and the United States have demutualized to provide greater flexibility for future growth. In 2007, we completed our merger with CBOT Holdings, NYSE Group completed its merger with Euronext and ICE acquired the New York Board of Trade and the Winnipeg Commodity Exchange. Also, in the last three months there has been a significant increase in activity among derivative dealers, banks and other entities to form competing exchanges. In December 2007, a consortium of 12 financial institutions announced their intention to form an exchange – referred to as Project Four Seasons – and in January 2008 Project Rainbow was formed to discuss launching a European derivatives exchange. Project Four Seasons has stated their intention to offer futures products that would be similar to our interest rate products. We believe we may also face competition from large computer software companies and media and technology companies. The number of businesses providing internet-related financial services is rapidly growing. Other companies have entered into or are forming joint ventures or consortia to provide services similar to those provided by us. Others may become competitive with us through acquisitions. Changes in federal law allow institutions that have been major participants on our exchange to trade the same or similar products among themselves without utilizing any exchange or trading system. Many of our competitors and potential competitors have greater financial, marketing, technological and personnel resources than we do. These factors may enable them to develop similar products, to provide lower transaction costs and better execution to their customers and to carry out their business strategies more quickly and efficiently than we can. In addition, our competitors may: • respond more quickly to competitive pressures due to their corporate governance structures, which may be more flexible and efficient than our corporate governance structure; • develop products that are preferred by our customers; • develop risk transfer products that compete with our products; • price their products and services more competitively; • develop and expand their network infrastructure and service offerings more efficiently; • utilize better, more user-friendly and more reliable technology; • take greater advantage of acquisitions, alliances and other opportunities; • more effectively market, promote and sell their products and services; • better leverage existing relationships with customers and alliance partners or exploit better recognized brand names to market and sell their services; and • exploit regulatory disparities between traditional, regulated exchanges and alternative markets that benefit from a reduced regulatory burden and lower-cost business model. 31 Table of Contents If our products, markets and services are not competitive, our business, financial condition and operating results will be materially harmed. A decline in our fees or any loss of customers could lower our revenues, which would adversely affect our profitability. Our average rate per contract is subject to fluctuation due to a number of factors. As a result, you will not be able to rely on our average rate per contract in any particular period as an indication of our future average rate per contract. Our average rate per contract, which impacts our operating results, is subject to fluctuation due to shifts in the mix of products traded, the trading venue and the mix of customers (whether the customer receives member or non-member fees or participates in one of our various incentive programs) and the impact of our tiered pricing structure. For example, we earn a higher rate per contract for trades executed electronically. In addition, our members and participants in our various incentive programs generally are charged lower fees than our non-member customers. Variation in each of these factors is difficult to predict and will have an impact on our average rate per contract in the particular period. For example, our average rate per contract decreased to $0.634 for the year ended December 31, 2007 from $0.645 for the same period in 2006. Because of this fluctuation, you may not be able to rely on our average rate per contract in any particular period as an indication of our future average rate per contract. If we fail to meet securities analysts’ expectations regarding our operating results, the price of our Class A common stock could decline substantially. Our quarterly operating results fluctuate due to seasonality. As a result, you will not be able to rely on our operating results in any particular quarter as an indication of our future performance. Generally, we have experienced relatively higher trading volume during the first and second quarters and sequentially lower trading volume in the third and fourth quarters. As a result of this seasonality, you will not be able to rely on our operating results in any particular period as an indication of our future performance. If we fail to meet securities analysts’ expectations regarding our operating results, the price of our Class A common stock could decline substantially. The CFMA has reduced the barriers of entry into our markets which has led to increased competition and enabled many of our customers to trade futures contracts other than on exchanges. These changes may adversely affect our trading volume, revenue and profits. Our industry has been subject to several fundamental regulatory changes, including changes in the statute under which we have operated since 1974. The Commodity Exchange Act generally required all futures contracts to be executed on an exchange that had been approved by the CFTC. The “exchange trading requirement” was modified by CFTC regulations and interpretations to permit privately negotiated swap contracts to be transacted in the over-the-counter market. The CFTC exemption under which the over-the-counter derivatives market operated precluded the over-the-counter market from using exchange-like electronic transaction systems and clearing facilities. These barriers to competition from the over-the-counter market were repealed by the CFMA. One of the chief beneficiaries of the CFMA has been over-the-counter dealers and competitors that operate or intend to open electronic trading facilities or to conduct their futures business directly among themselves on a bilateral basis. The customers who may access these trading facilities or engage in bilateral private transactions are the same customers who account for a substantial portion of our trading volume. The CFMA also permits banks, broker-dealers and some of their affiliates to engage in foreign exchange futures transactions for or with retail customers without being subject to regulation under the Commodity Exchange Act. These customers are the same customers who might otherwise use our foreign exchange products. The CFMA also permits bank clearing organizations and clearing organizations regulated by the SEC to clear a broad array of derivatives products in addition to the products that these clearing organizations have traditionally cleared. This allocation of jurisdiction may be advantageous to competing clearing organizations and result in a lower volume of trading cleared through our clearing house. In the future, our industry may become subject to new regulations or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing regulations. We cannot predict the extent to which any future regulatory changes may adversely impact our business, including our ability to compete with enterprises that offer off-exchange trading and benefit from a reduced regulatory burden and lower-cost business model. 32 Table of Contents Our trading volume, and consequently our revenues and profits, would be adversely affected if we are unable to retain our current customers or attract new customers to our exchange. The success of our business depends, in part, on our ability to maintain and increase our trading volume. To do so, we must maintain and expand our product offerings, our customer base and our trade execution alternatives. Our success also depends on our ability to maintain our trading volume and to offer competitive prices and services in an increasingly price sensitive business. We cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to expand our product lines, or that we will be able to retain our current customers or attract new customers. For example, the majority of the clearing and transaction fees we receive from our clearing firms represent charges for trades executed on behalf of their customers. We believe that in the event one of our clearing firms discontinues operations, the customer portion of that firm’s trading activity would likely transfer to another clearing firm. However, we cannot guarantee you that the discontinuation of any clearing firm would not result in our loss of customers which could have an adverse effect on our trading volumes or revenues. We also cannot assure you that we will not lose customers to low-cost competitors with comparable or superior products, services or trade execution facilities. If we fail to maintain our trading volume, expand our product offerings or execution facilities, or we lose a substantial number of our current customers, or a subset of customers representing a significant percentage of trading volume in a particular product line; or are unable to attract new customers, our business will be adversely affected. Any significant decline in the trading volume of our Eurodollar or S&P 500 futures and options on futures contracts would adversely affect our revenues and profitability. We are substantially dependent on trading volume from two product offerings for a significant portion of our clearing and transaction fee revenues and profits. The clearing and transaction fees revenue attributable to transactions in Eurodollar contracts and all our contracts based on the S&P 500 (including E-mini products) approximated 32% and 24%, respectively, of our total clearing and transaction fees revenue during the year ended December 31, 2007 and 46% and 26%, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2006. Any significant decline in our trading volume in either of these products would negatively impact our business, financial condition and operating results. We believe our Eurodollar futures contract serves as a global financial benchmark, but we cannot assure you that, in the future, other products will not become preferred alternatives to our Eurodollar contract as a means of managing or speculating on interest rate risk. We also cannot assure you that competitors will not enter the Eurodollar market. Our members may also elect to trade Eurodollars in privately negotiated bilateral transactions without the use of our clearing house. In either of these events, our trading volume, revenues and profitability could be adversely affected. Our license agreement with S&P provides that the S&P 500 Index futures products will be exclusive through December 31, 2008, after which we will retain our exclusive rights through December 31, 2016 so long as certain minimum average trading volume is met or other circumstances exist that relate to the reduction in trading volume. We cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain the exclusivity of our licensing agreement with S&P. In addition, we cannot assure you that others will not succeed in creating stock index futures based on information similar to that which we have obtained by license or that market participants will not increasingly use other instruments, including securities and options based on the S&P indexes, to manage or speculate on U.S. stock risks. Parties may also succeed in offering indexed products that are similar to our licensed products without being required to obtain a license or in countries that are beyond the jurisdictional reach of us and/or our licensors. Our clearing house operations expose us to substantial credit risk of third parties. Our financial condition will be adversely affected in the event of a significant default. Our clearing house acts as the counterparty to all trades consummated on or through our exchange or on third-party exchanges for which we provide clearing services. As a result, we are exposed to significant credit risk of third parties, including our clearing firms. We are also exposed, indirectly, to the credit risk of customers of our clearing firms. These parties may default on their obligations due to bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, operational failure or other reasons. We cannot guarantee you that one of our clearing firms will not default on its obligations in the future. Our surplus funds are at risk if a clearing firm defaults on its obligations to our clearing house and its performance bond and security deposits are insufficient to meet its obligations. Although we have policies and procedures to help ensure that our clearing firms can satisfy their obligations, these policies and procedures may not succeed in detecting problems or preventing defaults. We also have in place various measures intended to enable us to cover any default and maintain liquidity. However, we cannot assure you that these measures will be sufficient to protect us from a default or that we will not be materially and adversely affected in the event of a significant default. Additionally, the default of any one of our clearing firms could cause our customers to lose confidence in our markets and the guarantee of our clearing house, which would have an adverse affect on our business. 33 Table of Contents A key element of our strategy is to provide transaction processing, clearing and related services to third parties. If we are unable to continue to realize the benefits from providing these services, our revenues will be adversely impacted. Providing third-party transaction processing, clearing and related services is a key element of our strategy. We have an agreement with NYMEX, which began in June 2006, to be the exclusive trading service provider for NYMEX’s energy futures and options contracts and certain of their other products on our CME Globex platform. The initial term of the NYMEX agreement is for ten years from the date of launch with rolling three-year extensions. Additionally, prior to our merger with CBOT Holdings, we derived a significant amount of revenue from our transaction processing services agreement that we entered into with CBOT in 2003. In 2007, 2006 and 2005, we generated $48.2 million, $75.8 million and $68.7 million, respectively, in processing services revenue from our agreement with CBOT and we generated $56.4 million, $14.3 million and $4.5 million in revenue in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, from our agreement with NYMEX. Our future revenues from providing processing services to NYMEX or others will be dependent on the third party’s trading volume, which is subject to a number of factors beyond its control. For example, NYMEX’s ability to maintain or expand its trading volume and operate its business, as a futures exchange, is subject to the same types of risks to which we are subject. Any significant decrease in the trading volume at these exchanges will result in a corresponding decrease in our realized benefits from our processing services agreements. Our net income from the processing services we provide will also depend on our ability to control our costs associated with providing such services. We cannot assure you that we will enter into additional agreements to provide processing services or that our existing agreement with NYMEX will not be terminated prior to the end of its term or that any agreement would be renewed after its initial term or that any renewal will be on terms as favorable to us. For example, under the terms of our agreement with NYMEX, either party between the fifth and sixth anniversary of the first launch date may terminate the contract by providing notice and paying the other party a termination fee. Any such event could have an adverse effect on our revenues. Our market data fees may be reduced or eliminated by decreased demand or the growth of electronic trading and electronic order entry systems. If we are unable to offset that reduction through terminal usage fees or transaction fees, we will experience a reduction in revenue. We sell our market data to individuals and organizations that use our markets or monitor general economic conditions. Revenues from our market data totaled $145.1 million, representing 8% of our total revenues, and $80.8 million, or 7% of our total revenues, during the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. A decrease in overall trading volume may also lead to a decreased demand for our market data from the market data vendors. Additionally, electronic trading systems do not usually impose separate charges for supplying market data to trading terminals. If we do not separately charge for market data supplied to trading terminals, and trading terminals with access to our markets become widely available, we could lose market data fees from those who have access to trading terminals. We will experience a reduction in our revenues if we are unable to recover that lost quote fee revenue through terminal usage fees or transaction fees. If we experience systems failures or capacity constraints, our ability to conduct our operations and execute our business strategy could be materially harmed and we could be subjected to significant costs and liabilities. We are heavily dependent on the capacity and reliability of the computer and communications systems and software supporting our operations. We receive and/or process a large portion of our trade orders through electronic means, such as through public and private communications networks. Our systems, or those of our third party providers, may fail or operate slowly, causing one or more of the following to occur: • unanticipated disruptions in service to our customers; • slower response times; • delays in our customers’ trade execution; • failed settlement of trades; 34 Table of Contents • incomplete or inaccurate accounting, recording or processing of trades; • financial losses; • security breaches; • litigation or other customer claims; • loss of customers; and • regulatory sanctions. We cannot assure you that we will not experience systems failures from power or telecommunications failure, acts of God, war or terrorism, human error, natural disasters, fire, sabotage, hardware or software malfunctions or defects, computer viruses, acts of vandalism or similar events. If any of our systems do not operate properly or are disabled, including as a result of system failure, employee or customer error or misuse of our systems, we could suffer financial loss, liability to customers, regulatory intervention or reputational damage that could affect demand by current and potential users of our market. From time to time, we have experienced system errors and failures that have resulted in some customers being unable to connect to our electronic trading platform or erroneous reporting, such as transactions that were not authorized by any customer or reporting of filled orders as cancelled. For example, we have experienced technical failures that resulted in a temporary suspension of trading on the CME Globex platform. The impact of these events has not been material. However, we cannot assure you that if we experience system errors or failures in the future that they will not be material. Our status as a CFTC registrant generally requires that our trade execution and communications systems be able to handle anticipated present and future peak trading volume. Heavy use of our computer systems during peak trading times or at times of unusual market volatility could cause our systems to operate slowly or even to fail for periods of time. We constantly monitor system loads and performance and regularly implement system upgrades to handle estimated increases in trading volume. However, we cannot assure you that our estimates of future trading volume and order messaging traffic will be accurate or that our systems will always be able to accommodate actual trading volume and order messaging traffic without failure or degradation of performance. Increased CME Globex trading volume and order messaging traffic may result in connectivity problems or erroneous reports that may affect users of the platform. System failure or degradation could lead our customers to file formal complaints with industry regulatory organizations, to file lawsuits against us or to cease doing business with us or could lead the CFTC or other regulators to initiate inquiries or proceedings for failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations. We will need to continue to upgrade, expand and increase the capacity of our systems as our business grows and we execute our business strategy. Our goal is to design our systems to handle at least one and a half times our peak historical transactions in our highest volume products. As volumes of transactions grow, the ability of our systems to meet this goal on an ongoing basis depends on our ability to increase our system capacity on a timely basis while maintaining system reliability. Although many of our systems are designed to accommodate additional volume and products and services without redesign or replacement, we will need to continue to make significant investments in additional hardware and software to accommodate the increases in volume of transactions and order transaction traffic and to provide processing services to third parties. If we cannot increase the capacity and capabilities of our systems to accommodate an increasing volume of transactions and to execute our business strategy, our ability to maintain or expand our businesses would be adversely affected. 35 Table of Contents Some of our largest clearing firms have indicated their belief that clearing facilities should not be owned or controlled by exchanges and should be operated as utilities and not–for–profit. These clearing firms have sought, and may seek in the future, legislative or regulatory changes that would, if adopted, enable them to use alternative clearing services for positions established on our exchanges. Even if they are not successful, these factors may cause them to limit the use of our markets. Some of our largest clearing firms, which are significant customers and intermediaries in our products, have stressed the importance to them of centralizing clearing of futures contracts and options on futures contracts in order to maximize the efficient use of their capital, exercise greater control over their value at risk and extract greater operating leverage from clearing activities. Many clearing firms have expressed the view that clearing firms should control the governance of clearing houses or that clearing houses should be operated as utilities rather than as part of for-profit enterprises. Some of these firms, along with the Futures Industry Association, have sought, and may seek in the future, legislative or regulatory changes to be adopted that would facilitate mechanisms or policies that allow market participants to transfer positions from an exchange-owned clearing house to a clearing house owned and controlled by clearing firms. Additionally, in January 2008, the U.S. Department of Justice submitted a comment letter to the U.S. Department of the Treasury in response to the Department of the Treasury’s request for comment on the regulatory regime of the financial services industry. The comment letter stated that vertical integration of futures clearing houses impedes competition and should be reconsidered. Our strategic business plan is to operate a vertically integrated transaction execution, clearing and settlement business. If these legislative or regulatory changes are adopted, our strategy and business plan may lead clearing firms to establish, or seek to use, alternative clearing houses for clearing positions established on our exchanges. Even if they are not successful in their efforts, the factors described above may cause clearing firms to limit or stop the use of our products and markets. If any of these events occur, our revenues and profits would be adversely affected. We depend on third party suppliers and service providers for a number of services that are important to our business. An interruption or cessation of an important supply or service by any third party could have a material adverse effect on our business. We depend on a number of suppliers, such as banking, clearing and settlement organizations, telephone companies, online service providers, data processors, and software and hardware vendors for elements of our trading, clearing and other systems, as well as communications and networking equipment, computer hardware and software and related support and maintenance. We cannot assure you that any of these providers will be able to continue to provide these services in an efficient, cost-effective manner or that they will be able to adequately expand their services to meet our needs. An interruption in or the cessation of an important supply or service by any third party and our inability to make alternative arrangements in a timely manner, or at all, would result in lost revenue and higher costs. Our networks and those of our third party service providers may be vulnerable to security risks, which could result in wrongful use of our information or cause interruptions in our operations that cause us to lose customers and trading volume and result in significant liabilities. We could also be required to incur significant expense to protect our systems. We expect the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks to continue to be a critical element of our operations. Our networks and those of our third party service providers and our customers may be vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer viruses and other security problems. Persons who circumvent security measures could wrongfully use our information or cause interruptions or malfunctions in our operations. Any of these events could cause us to lose customers or trading volume. We may be required to expend significant resources to protect against the threat of security breaches or to alleviate problems, including reputational harm and litigation, caused by breaches. Although we intend to continue to implement security measures, these measures may prove to be inadequate and result in system failures and delays that could cause us to lose customers, experience lower trading volume and incur significant liabilities. 36 Table of Contents We operate in a heavily regulated environment that imposes significant costs and competitive burdens on our business. Although the CFMA significantly reduced our regulatory burdens, we remain extensively regulated by the CFTC. Our international operations may be subject to similar regulations in specific jurisdictions. We are registered in a number of countries outside the United States. In some cases, our registrations are subject to annual review and such reviews may subject us to additional requirements in the future. We may also be required to register or become subject to regulation in other jurisdictions in order to accept business from customers in those jurisdictions. Many aspects of our operations are subject to oversight and regulation by the CFTC. Our activities relating to single stock and narrow-based stock index futures products are also subject to oversight by the SEC. Our operations are subject to ongoing review and oversight, including: • the security and soundness of our order routing and trading systems; • record keeping and record retention procedures; • maintaining a fair and orderly market; • the licensing of our members and many of their employees; and • the conduct of our directors, officers, employees and affiliates. If we fail to comply with applicable laws, rules or regulations, we may be subject to censure, fines, cease-and-desist orders, suspension of our business, removal of personnel or other sanctions, including revocation of our designations as a contract market and derivatives clearing organization. The CFTC has broad powers to investigate and enforce compliance and punish non-compliance with its rules and regulations. We cannot assure you that we and/or our directors, officers, employees and affiliates will be able to fully comply with these rules and regulations. We also cannot assure you that we will not be subject to claims or actions by the CFTC or other agencies. Demutualization and the increasing utilization of electronic trading systems by traders from remote locations may, among other developments, impact our ability to continue the traditional form of “self-regulation” that has been an integral part of the CFTC regulatory program. On February 1, 2007, the CFTC issued recommendations as to an appropriate means for designated contract markets to comply with the core principle requiring self-regulatory organizations to mitigate potential conflicts of interest. The recommendations require at least 35% of the board of directors of a designated contract market to be directors with no material relationship with the exchange, including memberships on the exchange. The CFTC has not announced an effective date and is currently reviewing these recommendations. As a result of our merger with CBOT Holdings, our Board of Directors is now comprised of 30 members of which nine have no industry affiliation other than service on our Board. We have not yet completed our assessment as to whether such directors would be considered to have no material relationship with the exchange for purposes of the CFTC recommendation. We cannot guarantee that our Board will be in compliance with the recommendations. To the extent we are not in compliance, we will be required to demonstrate to the CFTC how we otherwise meet the requirements of the core principle. From time to time it is proposed in Congress that federal financial markets regulators should be consolidated, including a possible merger between the CFTC and the SEC. For example, in 2007, the U.S. Department of the Treasury solicited comments as part of its evaluation of the regulatory structure associated with financial institutions. While those proposals have not been adopted to date, the perceived convergence of product lines offered on the securities and commodity exchanges could make adoption more likely. To the extent the regulatory environment following such consolidation is less beneficial for us, our business, financial condition and operating results could be negatively affected. The CFTC is subject to reauthorization every five years, which was scheduled to be completed in 2005. This process is still ongoing and could result in legislation that may have a negative impact on the way we operate our exchange, including our ability to operate our self-regulatory functions or effectively compete with new entrants into our market place. 37 Table of Contents From time to time, including most recently in 2008, the President’s budget includes a proposal that a transaction tax be imposed on futures and options on futures transactions. While those proposals have not been adopted to date, except for a per-contract fee imposed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on single stock futures and futures on narrow-based stock indexes, the imposition of any such tax would increase the cost of using our products and, consequently, could adversely impact our trading volumes, revenues and profits. Changes in laws, regulations or governmental policies could have a material adverse effect on the way we conduct our business. Our compliance and risk management methods might not be effective and may result in outcomes that could adversely affect our reputation, financial condition and operating results. Generally, the CFTC has broad enforcement powers to censure, fine, issue cease-and-desist orders, prohibit us from engaging in some of our businesses or suspend or revoke our designation as a contract market or the registration of any of our officers or employees who violate applicable laws or regulations. Our ability to comply with applicable laws and rules is largely dependent on our establishment and maintenance of compliance, audit and reporting systems, as well as our ability to attract and retain qualified compliance and other risk management personnel. We face the risk of significant intervention by regulatory authorities, including extensive examination and surveillance activity. In the case of non-compliance or alleged non-compliance with applicable laws or regulations, we could be subject to investigations and judicial or administrative proceedings that may result in substantial penalties or civil lawsuits, including by customers, for damages, which can be significant. Any of these outcomes would adversely affect our reputation, financial condition and operating results. In extreme cases, these outcomes could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business. Our policies and procedures to identify, monitor and manage our risks may not be fully effective. Some of our risk management methods depend upon evaluation of information regarding markets, customers or other matters that are publicly available or otherwise accessible by us. That information may not in all cases be accurate, complete, up-to-date or properly evaluated. Management of operational, legal and regulatory risk requires, among other things, policies and procedures to record properly and verify a large number of transactions and events. We cannot assure you that our policies and procedures will always be effective or that we will always be successful in monitoring or evaluating the risks to which we are or may be exposed. As a financial services provider, we are subject to significant litigation risk and potential securities law liability. Many aspects of our business involve substantial liability risks. While we enjoy governmental immunity for some of our market-related activities, we could be exposed to substantial liability under federal and state laws and court decisions, as well as rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC and the CFTC. These risks include, among others, potential liability from disputes over terms of a trade, the claim that a system failure or delay caused monetary losses to a customer, that we entered into an unauthorized transaction or that we provided materially false or misleading statements in connection with a transaction. Dissatisfied customers frequently make claims regarding quality of trade execution, improperly settled trades, mismanagement or even fraud against their service providers. We may become subject to these claims as a result of failures or malfunctions of our systems and services we provide. We could incur significant legal expenses defending claims, even those without merit. In addition, an adverse resolution of any future lawsuit or claim against us could have a material adverse effect on our business. We could be harmed by misconduct or errors that are difficult to detect and deter. There have been a number of highly publicized cases involving fraud or other misconduct by employees of financial services firms in recent years. Misconduct by our employees and agents, including employees of GFX, our wholly-owned subsidiary that engages primarily in proprietary trading in foreign exchange futures, could include hiding unauthorized activities from us, improper or unauthorized activities on behalf of customers or improper use of confidential information. Misconduct could subject us to financial losses or regulatory sanctions and seriously harm our reputation. It is not always possible to deter misconduct, and the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases. Our employees and agents also may commit errors that could subject us to financial claims for negligence, as well as regulatory actions. For example, employees of GFX enter into transactions to promote liquidity in foreign exchange contracts on the CME Globex platform and subsequently enter into offsetting transactions using futures contracts or spot foreign exchange transactions with approved counterparties in the interbank market to limit market risk. In the event the offsetting transaction is not entered into or is not timely or properly executed, we could be exposed to substantial market risk. 38 Table of Contents We may have difficulty executing our growth strategy and maintaining our growth effectively. We have experienced significant growth in our business. Continued growth may require additional investment in personnel, facilities, information technology infrastructure and financial and management systems and controls and may place a significant strain on our management and resources. We may not be successful in implementing all of the processes that are necessary to support our growth organically or, as described in the following risk factor, through acquisitions or other strategic alliances. Unless our growth results in an increase in our revenues that is proportionate to the increase in our costs associated with our growth, our future profitability could be adversely affected, and we may have to incur significant expenditures to address the additional operational and control requirements as a result of our growth. Our acquisition, investment and alliance strategy involves risks. If we are unable to effectively manage these risks, our business will be materially harmed. To achieve our strategic objectives, in the future we may seek to acquire or invest in other companies, businesses or technologies. Acquisitions entail numerous risks, including the following: • difficulties in the assimilation of acquired businesses or technologies; • diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns; • assumption of unknown material liabilities; • difficulties in implementing adequate compliance and risk management methods for new operations; • failure to achieve financial or operating objectives; • potential loss of customers or key employees of acquired companies; and • exposure to foreign currency, which exposure may or may not be hedged or partially hedged; • difficulties in receiving approval from governmental authorities. We may not be able to integrate successfully any operations, personnel, services or products that we have acquired or may acquire in the future. See “Risks Relating to the Merger with CBOT Holdings” for additional risks. Additionally, we may need to incur significant indebtedness in order to finance future acquisitions. Such indebtedness may: • require us to dedicate a significant portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt, thereby reducing the availability of cash flow to fund capital expenditures, to pursue other acquisitions or investments in new technologies, to pay dividends and for general corporate purposes; • increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic conditions, including increases in interest rates if the borrowings bear interest at variable rates; and • limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in or challenges relating to our business and industry. We also may seek to expand or enhance some of our operations by forming joint ventures or alliances with various strategic partners throughout the world. Entering into joint ventures and alliances also entails risks, including difficulties in developing and expanding the business of newly formed joint ventures, exercising influence over the activities of joint ventures in which we do not have a controlling interest, and potential conflicts with our joint venture or alliance partners. We cannot assure you that any joint venture or alliance that we have entered into or may enter into in the future, will be successful. 39 Table of Contents The imposition in the future of regulations requiring that clearing houses establish linkages with other clearing houses whereby positions at one clearing house can be transferred to and maintained at, or otherwise offset by a fungible position existing at, another clearing house may have a material adverse effect on the operation of our business. In connection with the trading of single stock futures and futures on narrow-based stock indexes, the CFMA contemplates that clearing houses will establish linkages enabling a position in any such product executed on an exchange for which it clears these products to be offset by an economically linked or fungible position on the opposite side of the market that is executed on another exchange utilizing a different clearing house. If, in the future, a similar requirement is imposed with respect to futures contracts generally, the resulting unbundling of trade execution and clearing services would have a material adverse effect on our revenues and profits. Expansion of our operations internationally involves special challenges that we may not be able to meet, which could adversely affect our financial results. We plan to continue to expand our operations internationally, including by directly placing order entry terminals with customers outside the United States and by relying on distribution systems established by our current and future strategic alliance partners. We face certain risks inherent in doing business in international markets, particularly in the regulated derivatives exchange business. These risks include: • restrictions on the use of trading terminals or the contracts that may be traded; • becoming subject to extensive regulations and oversight, tariffs and other trade barriers; • difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations; • general economic and political conditions in the countries from which our markets are accessed, which may have an adverse effect on our volume from those countries; and • potentially adverse tax consequences. In addition, as a result of our expanding global operations, we may become subject to the laws and regulations of foreign governmental and regulatory authorities. These may include laws, rules and regulations relating to any aspect of the derivatives business. To date, we have had limited experience in marketing and operating our products and services internationally. We cannot assure you that we will be able to succeed in marketing our products and services in international markets. We may also experience difficulty in managing our international operations because of, among other things, competitive conditions overseas, management of foreign exchange risk, established domestic markets, language and cultural differences and economic or political instability. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on the success of our international operations and, consequently, on our business, financial condition and operating results. Our business is subject to risks related to our real estate holdings. Revenue from our real estate operations represented about 1% of our operating revenue for the year ended December 31, 2007. Lower occupancy rates, market rental rates and non-renewal of leases by tenants could have a material adverse effect on revenue from building operations. Any decrease in leased space could also affect future building service revenue if there is no corresponding demand for the vacated office space. Furthermore, most of our tenants are engaged in businesses that are directly or indirectly related to the brokerage/trading industry or related areas of financial services and adverse business conditions affecting those businesses could have a material adverse effect on our occupancy rates and building services revenues. We may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights, which may materially harm our business. We rely primarily on trade secret, copyright, service mark, trademark and patent law and contractual protections to protect our proprietary technology and other proprietary rights. We have filed several patent applications covering our technology in the United States and certain other jurisdictions. Notwithstanding the precautions we take to protect our intellectual property rights, it is possible that third parties may copy or otherwise obtain and use our proprietary technology without authorization or otherwise infringe on our rights. We also seek to protect our software and databases as trade secrets and under copyright law. We have copyright registrations for certain of our software, user manuals and databases. The copyright protection afforded to databases, however, is fairly limited. 40 Table of Contents While the arrangement and selection of data generally are protectable, the actual data may not be, and others may be free to create databases that would perform the same function. In some cases, including a number of our most important products, there may be no effective legal recourse against duplication by competitors. In addition, in the future, we may have to rely on litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights, protect our trade secrets, determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or defend against claims of infringement or invalidity. Any such litigation, whether successful or unsuccessful, could result in substantial costs to us and diversions of our resources, either of which could adversely affect our business. Any infringement by us on patent rights of others could result in litigation and adversely affect our ability to continue to provide, or increase the cost of providing, our products and electronic execution services. Patents of third parties may have an important bearing on our ability to offer certain of our products and services. Our competitors as well as other companies and individuals may obtain, and may be expected to obtain in the future, patents related to the types of products and services we offer or plan to offer. We cannot assure you that we are or will be aware of all patents containing claims that may pose a risk of infringement by our products and services. In addition, some patent applications in the United States are confidential until a patent is issued and, therefore, we cannot evaluate the extent to which our products and services may be covered or asserted to be covered by claims contained in pending patent applications. These claims of infringement are not uncommon in our industry. In general, if one or more of our products or services were to infringe on patents held by others, we may be required to stop developing or marketing the products or services, to obtain licenses to develop and market the services from the holders of the patents or to redesign the products or services in such a way as to avoid infringing on the patent claims. We cannot assess the extent to which we may be required in the future to obtain licenses with respect to patents held by others, whether such licenses would be available or, if available, whether we would be able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms. If we were unable to obtain such licenses, we may not be able to redesign our products or services to avoid infringement, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. We may be at greater risk from terrorism than other companies. We may be more likely than other companies to be a direct target of, or an indirect casualty of, attacks by terrorists or terrorist organizations. It is impossible to predict the likelihood or impact of any terrorist attack on the derivatives industry generally or on our business. In the event of an attack or a threat of an attack, our security measures and contingency plans may be inadequate to prevent significant disruptions in our business, technology or access to the infrastructure necessary to maintain our business. Damage to our facilities due to terrorist attacks may be significantly in excess of any amount of insurance received, or we may not be able to insure against such damage at a reasonable price or at all. The threat of terrorist attacks may also negatively affect our ability to attract and retain employees. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. Risks Relating to the Merger with CBOT Holdings We may fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits of our merger with CBOT Holdings. On July 12, 2007, CME Holdings completed its merger with CBOT Holdings and CBOT Holdings was merged with and into CME Holdings. The success of the merger will depend, in part, on our ability to achieve the anticipated cost synergies and other strategic benefits from combining the businesses of CME Holdings and CBOT Holdings. We expect CME Group to benefit from operational synergies resulting from the consolidation of capabilities and elimination of redundancies as well as greater efficiencies from increased scale, market integration and more automation. We expect annual expense savings of more than $100 million in 2008. However, to realize these anticipated benefits, we must successfully combine the businesses of CME Holdings and CBOT Holdings. If we are not able to achieve these objectives, the anticipated cost synergies and other strategic benefits of the merger may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected. We may fail to realize some or all of the anticipated benefits of the transaction in the amounts and times projected for a number of reasons, including that the integration may take longer than anticipated or be more costly than anticipated. 41 Table of Contents The failure to integrate successfully the businesses and operations of CME Holdings and CBOT Holdings in the expected time frame may adversely affect CME Group’s future results. Prior to the completion of the merger, CME Holdings and CBOT Holdings historically operated as independent companies. The management of CME Group may face significant challenges in consolidating the functions of CME Holdings and CBOT Holdings and their subsidiaries, integrating their technologies, organizations, procedures, policies and operations, as well as addressing differences in the business cultures of the two companies and retaining key personnel. Our remaining integration efforts include the consolidation of the two trading floors, the consolidation of market data services and the consolidation of certain regulatory functions. The integration process is complex and time consuming, and requires substantial resources and effort. The integration process and other disruptions resulting from the merger may also disrupt our ongoing businesses or cause inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that adversely affect our relationships with members of CME and CBOT and other market participants, employees, regulators and others with whom we have business or other dealings. In addition, difficulties in integrating the businesses or regulatory functions of CME Holdings and CBOT Holdings could harm the reputation of CME Group. We have incurred costs in connection with the merger and will continue to incur costs in connection with the merger. CME Holdings and CBOT Holdings have incurred significant costs associated with transaction fees, professional services and other costs related to the merger and CME Group will continue to incur additional costs, including restructuring costs, in connection with the integration of the business. Specifically, through December 31, 2007, CME Holdings and CBOT Holdings have incurred approximately $114.3 million for costs related to their merger. Although CME Group expects that the realization of efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses will offset incremental transaction, merger-related and restructuring costs over time, this net benefit may not be achieved in the near term, or at all. We may incur significant indebtedness in order to finance the guarantee of the Chicago Board Options Exchange exercise right privileges, which may limit our operating flexibility, and we may not realize the value of the exercise right privileges we purchased. On September 26, 2007, we purchased 159 CBOE exercise right privileges (ERPs) from CBOT members. At December 31, 2007, these acquired ERPs totaled $36.6 million and were recorded in other non-current assets in our consolidated balance sheets. Additionally, eligible holders of ERPs are entitled to a maximum guaranteed payment from us of $250,000 upon resolution of the lawsuit between CBOT and CBOE. In connection with this guarantee, we have recorded a liability of $14.0 million related to the fair value of the guarantee obligation which is included in other non-current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. The value of the outstanding guarantee and the value of the ERPs we acquired will continue to be adjusted on a quarterly basis until the lawsuit is resolved. To the extent the lawsuit results in no recovery, our obligation under the guarantee would be $293.0 million which would require us to dedicate a significant portion of our cash on hand or incur additional indebtedness. Additionally, in such event, we would be required to write off the ERPs owned by us. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS Not applicable. ITEM 2. PROPERTIES Our corporate headquarters are located at 20 South Wacker Drive, Chicago, Illinois 60606. Effective as of August 24, 2007, we entered into a new lease at 20 South Wacker Drive providing for approximately 360,000 square feet of office, lobby and support space which includes the lower trading floor space. The upper trading floor will no longer be leased by us and will be vacated following the migration of the CME trading facilities to 141 West Jackson Boulevard in Chicago. We will retain an option to lease the upper trading floor as office space. The initial term of the lease expires in 2022 with two consecutive options to extend the term for seven and ten years, respectively. The lease also includes various expansion and contraction options. As a result of our merger with CBOT Holdings, we now own three buildings located at 141 West Jackson Boulevard in Chicago, which consist of a total of approximately 1,500,000 square feet. We occupy approximately 489,000 square feet of office, trading floor and support space at this location. We plan on vacating approximately 100,000 square feet of the office portion of this space over the next two years as a result of our combination with CBOT Holdings. We lease the remaining space to third parties. 42 Table of Contents We also lease additional office space at 550 West Washington in Chicago for approximately 220,000 square feet of office space on a phased-in basis through 2011 pursuant to a lease that expires in 2023. In addition to back up facilities located at 10 and 30 South Wacker Drive in Chicago, we maintain remote facilities with redundant system components located on leased property. In 2007, we purchased a building for an additional remote data center. We also lease administrative office space in Washington, D.C., Tokyo, Japan, Hong Kong, China, Mumbai, India and Sydney, Australia and both administrative and communication equipment space in London, England. We sublease a portion of the London office space to FXMS. We believe our facilities are adequate for our current operations and that additional space can be obtained if needed. ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS From time to time, we are involved in legal proceedings and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we are not a party to or, to our knowledge, threatened with any litigation or other legal proceeding that, in our opinion, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition. Eurex On October 14, 2003, the U.S. Futures Exchange, L.L.C. (Eurex U.S.) and U.S. Exchange Holdings, Inc., filed suit against CBOT and CME in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. The suit alleges that CBOT and CME violated the antitrust laws and tortiously interfered with the business relationship and contract between Eurex U.S. and The Clearing Corporation. Eurex U.S. and U.S. Exchange Holdings, Inc. are seeking a preliminary injunction and treble damages. On December 12, 2003, CBOT and CME filed separate motions to dismiss or, in the event the motion to dismiss is denied, to move the venue to the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. On September 2, 2004, the judge granted CBOT’s and CME’s motion to transfer venue to the Northern District of Illinois. In light of that decision, the judge did not rule on the motions to dismiss. On March 25, 2005, Eurex U.S. filed a second amended complaint in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. On June 6, 2005, CME and CBOT filed a motion to dismiss the complaint. On August 25, 2005, the judge denied the joint CME/CBOT motion to dismiss. The parties are currently engaged in discovery. On April 9, 2007, CME and CBOT filed two joint motions for summary judgment. Based on our investigation to date and advice from legal counsel, we believe this suit is without merit and we intend to vigorously defend against these charges. CBOE Class Action On August 23, 2006, CBOT Holdings and CBOT, along with a class consisting of certain CBOT full members, filed a lawsuit in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware against the CBOE. The lawsuit seeks to enforce and protect the CBOE exercise rights. The lawsuit alleges that these exercise rights allow CBOT’s full members who hold them to become full members of CBOE and to participate on an equal basis with other members of CBOE in CBOE’s announced plans to demutualize. On January 4, 2007, the plaintiffs filed a Second Amended Complaint, in which they added a count seeking a declaration that, contrary to the position taken by the CBOE before the SEC, the merger between CBOT Holdings and CME Holdings did not result in the termination of the exercise rights. The lawsuit seeks declaratory and injunctive relief as well as recovery of attorneys’ fees. On January 11, 2007, the plaintiffs filed a motion for partial summary judgment. On January 16, 2007, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the Second Amended Complaint. On January 15, 2008, the SEC approved CBOE’s rule interpretation that no person qualifies to become or remain a CBOE exerciser member following our merger with CBOT Holdings. All parties to the litigation and the judge have agreed that the stay previously granted in August 2007, which was implemented pending the SEC’s decision, is no longer in effect and CBOT has filed a motion seeking to amend our complaint to reflect current circumstances. 43 Table of Contents ITEM 4. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS Not applicable. 44 Table of Contents PART II ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES Class A Common Stock Our Class A common stock is listed on the NYSE and the NASDAQ Global Select Market Inc. under the ticker symbol “CME.” As of February 20, 2008, there were 1,830 holders of record of our Class A common stock. The following table sets forth the high and low sales prices per share of our Class A common stock on a quarterly basis, as reported on the NYSE. 2007 High Low 2006 High Low First Quarter $ 596.26 $ 510.00 First Quarter $ 457.50 $ 354.51 Second Quarter 565.00 497.00 Second Quarter 503.94 417.90 Third Quarter 609.92 506.50 Third Quarter 508.78 425.79 Fourth Quarter 714.48 593.58 Fourth Quarter 557.97 464.70 Class B Common Stock Our Class B common stock is not listed on a national securities exchange or traded in an organized over-the-counter market. Each class of our Class B common stock is associated with a membership in a specific division of our CME exchange. CME’s rules provide exchange members with trading rights and the ability to use or lease these trading rights. Each share of our Class B common stock can be transferred only in connection with the transfer of the associated trading rights. The memberships by class are CME (Chicago Mercantile Exchange), IMM (International Monetary Market), IOM (Index and Option Market) and GEM (Growth and Emerging Markets). Class B shares and the associated trading rights are bought and sold through our Shareholder Relations and Membership Services Department. In addition, trading rights may be leased through the department. Trading rights sales are reported on our Web site at www.cmegroup.com. Although our Class B shareholders have special voting rights, because our Class B shares have the same equitable interest in our earnings and the same dividend payments as our Class A shares, we expect that the market price of our Class B common stock, if reported separately from the associated trading rights, would be determined by the value of our Class A common stock. As of February 20, 2008, there were 1,890 holders of record of our Class B common stock. Dividends The following table sets forth the dividends we paid on our Class A and Class B common stock in the last two years: Record Date Dividend per Share Record Date Dividend per Share March 9, 2007 $ 0.86 March 10, 2006 $ 0.63 June 8, 2007 0.86 June 9, 2006 0.63 September 10, 2007 0.86 September 8, 2006 0.63 December 10, 2007 0.86 December 8, 2006 0.63 We intend to pay regular quarterly dividends to our shareholders. The decision to pay a dividend, however, remains within the discretion of our Board of Directors and may be affected by various factors, including our earnings, financial condition, capital requirements, level of indebtedness and other considerations our Board of Directors deems relevant. Our existing credit facility as well as future credit facilities, other future debt obligations and statutory provisions may limit our ability to pay dividends. On January 30, 2008, the Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of $1.15 per share, representing a 34% increase over the prior quarter, to be paid on March 25, 2008, to shareholders of record on March 10, 2008. 45 Table of Contents PERFORMANCE GRAPH The following graph compares the cumulative five-year total return provided shareholders on our Class A common stock relative to the cumulative total returns of the S&P 500 index, and our new and former peer groups described below as of the end of the year. An investment of $100 (with reinvestment of all dividends) is assumed to have been made in our Class A common stock, in each of the peer groups, and the index on December 31, 2002 and its relative performance is tracked through December 31, 2007. We compiled the new peer group to more closely reflect our competitors in our industry. We believe the new peer group provides a more meaningful basis for comparison of our stock performance.

(CBOT Holdings) merged with Chicago Mercantile Exchange Holdings Inc. (CME Holdings) to become CME Group Inc. (CME Group). The following discussion and analysis includes only the consolidated results of CME Holdings and its subsidiaries for 2005, 2006 and for January 1, 2007 through July 12, 2007. The financial results of CME Holdings and CBOT Holdings are included in the consolidated financial results of CME Group beginning on July 13, 2007. References in this discussion and analysis to “we” and “our” are to CME Group and its consolidated subsidiaries, collectively. References to our “exchange” are to Chicago Mercantile Exchange Inc. (CME), Board of Trade of the City of Chicago, Inc. (CBOT) and their subsidiaries, collectively. OVERVIEW Business Structure CME Group, a Delaware stock corporation, is the holding company for CME, CBOT and their subsidiaries. The holding company structure is designed to provide strategic and operational flexibility. CME Group’s Class A common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange and The Nasdaq Global Select Market under the ticker symbol “CME.” CME and CBOT are designated contract markets for the trading of futures and options on futures contracts. Futures contracts and options on futures contracts provide investors with vehicles for protecting against, and potentially profiting from, price changes in financial instruments and physical commodities. Futures contracts are legally binding standardized agreements to buy or sell a financial instrument or commodity, specifying quantity and quality at a set price on a future date. Certain futures contracts, such as commodities and foreign exchange products, may result in physical delivery of the product traded. Other futures contracts, including those for equity index and interest rate products, are cash settled and do not involve physical delivery. To provide additional flexibility to the investment community, we also offer trading in options on futures contracts. These contracts offer the customer the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an underlying futures contract at a particular price by a particular time. We are a global exchange with customer access available all over the world. Our customers consist of professional traders, financial institutions, individual and institutional investors, major corporations, manufacturers, producers and governments. Customers include both members of the exchange and non-members. 50 Table of Contents We offer our customers the opportunity to trade futures contracts and options on futures contracts on a range of products including those based on interest rates, equities, foreign exchange, commodities and alternative investments. Our products provide a means for hedging, speculating and allocating assets. We identify new products by monitoring economic trends and their impact on the risk management and speculative needs of our existing and prospective customers. Our major product lines are traded through our electronic trading platforms and our open outcry trading floors. These execution facilities offer our customers immediate trade execution and price transparency. As of January 2008, all products, with the exception of CBOT metals products, are traded on the CME Globex platform. CBOT metals products continue to be traded on the e-CBOT platform. We plan to consolidate our trading floors in the second quarter of 2008. In addition, trades can be executed through privately negotiated transactions that are cleared and settled through our clearing house. We also offer trading in medium- and long-term interest rate swaps denominated in euros, Swiss francs, pounds sterling and U.S. dollars, which are traded on the Swapstream platform. Our clearing house clears, settles and guarantees every futures and options contract traded through our exchange. Ownership and control of our own clearing house enables us to capture the revenue associated with both the trading and clearing of our products. Ownership also enables us to more quickly and efficiently bring new products to market through coordination of our clearing functions with our product development, technology, market regulation and risk management activities. Our clearing house performance guarantee is an important function of our business. Because of this guarantee, our customers do not need to evaluate the credit of each potential counterparty or limit themselves to a selected set of counterparties. This flexibility increases the potential liquidity available for each trade. Additionally, the substitution of our clearing house as the counterparty to every transaction allows our customers to establish a position with one party and then to offset the position with another party. This contract offsetting process provides our customers with flexibility in establishing and adjusting positions and provides for performance bond efficiencies. To ensure performance of counterparties, we establish and monitor financial requirements for our clearing firms and mark-to-market their positions at least twice a day. We also set minimum performance bond requirements for our traded products. In the unlikely event of a payment default by a clearing firm, we would first apply assets of that clearing firm to cover its payment obligation. These assets include security deposits, performance bonds and any other available assets, such as the proceeds from the sale of pledged Class A and Class B common stock and associated trading rights of the clearing firm at our exchange that are owned by or assigned to the clearing firm. In addition, we would make a demand for payment pursuant to any applicable guarantee provided to the exchange by the parent company of a clearing firm. Thereafter, if the payment default remains unsatisfied, we would use, in order, CME’s surplus funds, security deposits of other clearing firms and funds collected through an assessment against all other solvent clearing firms to satisfy the deficit. Industry Trends Derivatives exchanges that provide markets for futures and options have become a global growth industry, with a compound annual growth rate of 36% from 2002 through June 2007, based on notional value. By comparison, the over-the-counter derivatives market has grown at a compound annual growth rate of 35% during the same period. There are a number of trends that we believe will continue to drive growth and innovation in our industry. They include: • A greater need for risk management and hedging tools in an increasingly uncertain geopolitical and economic climate; • Growing investor sophistication regarding derivatives and risk transfer markets; • A shift in asset management strategies away from passive buy-and-hold equity investment strategies toward more active strategies including those involving alternative investments and asset classes; and • Growth in hedge funds and managed funds as alternative investment vehicles designed to generate more trading-based returns than other investment strategies. These types of alternative investment vehicles often utilize exchange-traded derivatives contracts. 51 Table of Contents Changing market dynamics also have led to increasing competition in all aspects of our business from both domestic and international sources. We face competition from other futures, securities and securities option exchanges; over-the-counter markets and clearing organizations; consortia formed by our members and large market participants; alternative trade execution facilities; and technology firms, including market data distributors and electronic trading system developers. We expect competition to continue to intensify, particularly as a result of technological advances and reductions in the regulatory requirements for the development of products and markets that are competitive with our own. Additional factors that may intensify competition in the future include: • The growth of recently-formed for-profit exchanges; • The consolidation of exchanges, customers or intermediaries; • An increased demand for electronic trading and electronic order routing services; and • The increased ability of other exchanges to leverage their technology investment and electronic distribution to enter new markets and list products that compete with our own. Strategy Our current strategy specifically focuses on leveraging our benchmark products, scalable infrastructure and clearing and trade matching technologies to benefit customers. This strategy will enable us to continue to evolve into a more broadly diversified financial exchange that offers trading and clearing solutions across additional products and asset classes. Our strategy includes coordinated efforts to: • Grow organically by broadening our product range by extending our current product lines and introducing innovative new products in both the exchange and over-the counter markets; • Provide third-party transaction processing, clearing and other trading related services; • Leverage our technology by expanding customer access to our markets and services, enhancing and offering additional trade execution choices, and improving our market data products; • Explore new business opportunities such as joint ventures, alliances and selective business combinations; and • Expand and diversify our customer base worldwide. Primary Sources of Operating Revenue Clearing and transaction fees. A majority of our revenue is derived from clearing and transaction fees, which include electronic trading fees, surcharges for privately-negotiated transactions and other volume-related charges for contracts executed through our trading venues. Because clearing and transaction fees are assessed on a per-contract basis, revenues and profitability fluctuate with volume changes. In addition to the trends noted earlier, our revenues and trading volume tend to increase during periods of economic and geopolitical uncertainty. This is because our customers seek to manage their exposure to, or speculate on, the market volatility resulting from uncertainty. In addition, our volume can be seasonal, and historically, we have experienced higher sequential volume during the first and second quarters followed by decreases in the third and fourth quarters of the calendar year. However, these patterns may be altered by the impact of economic and political events, the launch of new products, mergers and acquisitions as well as other factors. While volume has the most significant impact on our clearing and transaction fees revenue, there are four other factors that also influence this source of revenue: • Rate structure; • Mix of products traded; • Trading venue; and • The percentage of trades executed by customers who are members compared with non-member customers. 52 Table of Contents Rate structure. Customers benefit from volume discounts and limits on fees as part of our effort to increase liquidity in certain products. We may periodically change fees, volume discounts, limits on fees and member discounts, perhaps significantly, based on our review of operations and the business environment. As a result of their rate structure, Total Return Asset Contracts (TRAKRS), Swapstream products and auction-traded products are excluded from disclosures of trading volume and average rate per contract in this discussion and analysis. Clearing and transaction fees on these products are immaterial relative to our other products. TRAKRS are exchange-traded non-traditional futures contracts that trade electronically on the CME Globex electronic platform. Swapstream offers interest rate swap products through its inter-dealer electronic trading platform. Auction-traded products, which included CME economic derivatives, were previously traded on the CME Auction Markets platform through July 2007. Product mix. We offer trading of futures and options on futures contracts on a wide-ranging set of products based on interest rates, equities, foreign exchange, commodities and alternative investments. Rates are varied by product in order to optimize revenue on existing products and support introduction of new products to encourage trading volume. Trading venue. Our exchange is an international marketplace that brings together buyers and sellers mainly through our electronic trading platforms as well as through open outcry trading on our trading floors and privately negotiated transactions. Any customer guaranteed by a clearing firm is able to obtain direct access to our electronic platforms. Open outcry trading is conducted exclusively by our members, who may execute trades on behalf of customers or for themselves. Typically, customers executing trades through our electronic platforms are charged fees for using the platform in addition to the fees assessed on all transactions executed on our exchange. Customers entering into privately negotiated transactions also incur additional charges beyond the fees assessed on all transactions. Member/non-member mix. Generally, member customers are charged lower fees than our non-member customers. Holding all other factors constant, revenue decreases if the percentage of trades executed by members increases, and increases if the percentage of non-member trades increases. Quotation data fees. We receive quotation data fees from the dissemination of our market data to subscribers. Our market data services are provided primarily through third-party distributors. Subscribers can obtain access to real-time, delayed and end-of-day quotation, trade and summary market data for our products. Users of our basic service receive real-time quotes and pay a flat monthly fee for each screen, or device, displaying our market data. Alternatively, customers can subscribe to market data provided on a limited group of products. The fee for this service is also a flat rate per month. Pricing for our market data services is based on the value of the service provided, our cost structure for the service and the price of comparable services offered by our competitors. Increases or decreases in our quotation data fees revenue is influenced by changes in our price structure for existing market data offerings, introduction of new market data services and changes in the number of devices in use. General economic factors that affect the financial services industry, which constitutes our primary customer base, also influence revenue from our market data fees. Processing services. To further diversify the range of services we offer, we have entered into clearing and transaction processing agreements with other exchanges. This revenue will fluctuate as the trading volume of these exchanges fluctuates. This revenue includes fees for listing energy and metal futures products on the CME Globex platform for the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX). Although trading under a prior agreement with NYMEX ended in November 2005, trading under a new 10-year agreement began in June 2006. Additionally, in 2007, we began providing clearing and risk management services for trades executed at FXMarketSpace Limited (FXMS), our joint venture with Reuters Group PLC (Reuters), which offers centrally-cleared over-the-counter trading of foreign exchange spot contracts. We also collect fees for processing trades for certain CME clearing firms that execute trades at OneChicago, LLC (OneChicago), our joint venture in single stock futures and futures on narrow-based stock indexes. 53 Table of Contents Our agreement with CBOT to provide clearing and related services for CBOT products was terminated upon consummation of the merger. Processing services revenue includes fees from this agreement in 2005, 2006 and for the period January 1 through July 12, 2007. Other sources. Other sources of revenue include access and communication fees and revenue from various services related to our operations. Access and communication fees are the connectivity charges to customers of the CME Globex and e-CBOT platforms, to our market data vendors and to direct market data customers as well as charges to members and clearing firms that utilize our various telecommunications networks and communications services. Access fee revenue varies depending on the type of connection provided to customers. Revenue from communication fees is largely dependent on open outcry trading, as a significant portion relates to telecommunications on our trading floors. Other revenues include rent charged to third party tenants as well as ancillary charges for utilities, parking and miscellaneous services provided to tenants. As part of our merger with CBOT Holdings, we acquired three buildings with over 1.5 million square feet of commercial space in Chicago’s central business district. The retail and office space is rented primarily to third party tenants, including company shareholders and exchange customers. All tenants pay market rates for rent. The majority of tenant leases have terms of three to five years, with larger tenants having leases for up to nineteen years. These revenues are generally affected by market rental rates, lease renewals and business conditions in the financial services industry in which most of our tenants operate. Other revenues also includes fees for administering our Interest Earning Facility (IEF) program, trade order routing, and various services to members and clearing firms. We offer clearing firms the opportunity to invest cash performance bonds in our various IEF offerings. These clearing firms receive interest income, and we receive a fee based on total funds on deposit. In addition, other revenues includes trading gains and losses generated by GFX Corporation (GFX), our wholly-owned subsidiary that trades primarily in foreign exchange futures contracts to enhance liquidity in our electronic markets for these products. Primary Operating Expenses With the exception of license fees paid for the trading of our equity index contracts and a component of our trading facility rent that is related to open outcry trading volume, most of our expenses do not vary directly with changes in our trading volume. Compensation and benefits. Compensation and benefits expense is our most significant expense and includes employee wages, bonuses, stock-based compensation, benefits and employer taxes. Changes in this expense are driven by fluctuations in the number of employees, increases in wages as a result of inflation or labor market conditions, rates for employer taxes and other cost increases affecting benefit plans. In addition, this expense is affected by the composition of our work force, which includes a growing percentage of technology-related employees. The expense associated with our bonus and stock-based compensation plans can also have a significant impact on this expense category and may vary from year to year. The bonus component of our compensation and benefits expense is based on our financial performance. Under the performance criteria of our annual incentive plan, the bonus funded under the plan would be the “target” level if we achieve the cash earnings target established by the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors. Cash earnings are defined as net income excluding tax-effected amortization of purchased intangibles, depreciation and amortization expense, and tax-effected stock-based compensation expense less capital expenditures. Under the plan, if our actual cash earnings equal 80% of the established target for a given year, the bonus will be reduced by approximately 50% of the target bonus amount. There will be no bonus if our cash earnings are less than 80% of the cash earnings target, other than for non-exempt employees who may receive a bonus under our discretionary bonus program. If our actual cash earnings equal 120% of the target or higher, the bonus would be increased by approximately 50% from the targeted bonus amount, which is the maximum amount established by the Compensation Committee. If our performance is between the threshold performance level of 80% of the cash earnings target and the maximum performance level of 120% of the cash earnings target, the bonus will be calculated based on the level of performance achieved. The Compensation Committee may adjust the cash earnings calculation and the target level of performance for material, unplanned revenue, expense or capital expenditures to meet intermediate to long-term growth opportunities. Beginning in 2007, the cash earnings calculation for bonus purposes excludes investment income and interest expense as well as expense resulting from the guarantee of the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc. (CBOE) exercise right privileges. Targeted cash levels have been adjusted accordingly for these changes in the cash earnings calculation. 54 Table of Contents Stock-based compensation is a non-cash expense related to stock options and restricted stock grants. Effective January 1, 2006, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123(R), “Share-Based Payment.” SFAS No. 123(R) requires the use of the fair value method of accounting for share-based payments, which we previously adopted in 2002 under SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation.” SFAS No. 123(R) also requires that we estimate expected forfeitures of stock grants instead of the previous practice of accounting for forfeitures as they occurred. Stock-based compensation varies depending on the quantity and fair value of options granted. Fair value is derived using the Black-Scholes model with assumptions about our dividend yield, the expected volatility of our stock price based on an analysis of implied and historical volatility, the risk-free interest rate and the expected life of the options granted. Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense results from the depreciation of long-lived assets purchased, as well as the amortization of purchased and internally developed software. This expense has increased consistently from year to year due to significant technology investments in equipment and software. Depreciable useful lives have remained relatively consistent since January 1, 2004. As a result of our merger with CBOT Holdings, we acquired three commercial buildings. We utilize space in these buildings as offices and a trading floor. Depreciation and amortization on the building and building improvements as well as other furniture, fixtures and equipment acquired in the merger has been recorded since the merger closed on July 12, 2007. Other expenses. We incur additional ongoing expenses for communications, technology support services and various other activities necessary to support our operations. • Communications expense consists primarily of costs for network connections to our electronic trading platforms and some market data customers; telecommunications costs of our exchange; and fees paid for access to external market data. This expense is affected primarily by the growth of electronic trading, our capacity requirements and by changes in the number of telecommunications hubs and connections which allow customers outside the United States access to our electronic trading platforms directly. • Technology support services consist of costs related to maintenance of the hardware and software required to support our technology. Our technology support services costs are driven by system capacity, functionality and redundancy requirements. • Professional fees and outside services expense includes costs of consulting services provided for major strategic and technology initiatives as well as legal and accounting fees. This expense fluctuates primarily as a result of changes in services required to complete initiatives. • Amortization of purchased intangibles includes amortization of intangibles obtained in our merger with CBOT Holdings as well as other asset and business acquisitions. These intangible assets consist mainly of customer relationships, the Dow Jones & Company, Inc. (Dow Jones) licensing agreement, and lease-related intangible assets. • Occupancy and building operations expense consists of costs related to leased and owned property including rent, maintenance, real estate taxes, utilities and other related costs. Our office space is located primarily in Chicago with smaller offices located in Washington, D.C., London, Hong Kong, Sydney and Tokyo. Additionally, we have trading facilities in Chicago as well as data centers in various U.S. locations. Occupancy costs are relatively stable, although our CME trading floor rent fluctuates to a limited extent based on open outcry trading volume. • Licensing and other fee arrangements expense consists primarily of license fees paid as a result of trading volume in equity index products. This expense fluctuates with changes in equity index product trading volume and fee structure changes in the licensing agreements. Subsequent to the merger with CBOT Holdings, this expense includes licensing fees for trading volume in Dow Jones products. During 2005 and 2006, under a prior agreement with Singapore Exchange Limited (SGX), revenue sharing expense fluctuated based on our percentage of electronically traded CME Eurodollar contracts up to a maximum expense of $0.3 million per month. We recently renewed this agreement, and effective February 2007, the revenue sharing provisions of the agreement terminated and the expense was eliminated. 55 Table of Contents • Other expense includes marketing-related as well as general administrative costs. Marketing, advertising and public relations expense consists primarily of media, print and other advertising expenses, expenses incurred as part of various brand campaigns as well as the promotion of new and existing products and services. Non-Operating Income and Expense Non-operating income and expense includes investment income, securities lending interest income and expense, interest expense, expense related to the guarantee of exercise right privileges and equity in losses of unconsolidated subsidiaries. • Investment income represents income generated by the short-term investment of our excess cash balances and clearing firms’ cash performance bonds and security deposits; interest income and net realized gains and losses from our marketable securities and long-term equity method investments as well as gains and losses on trading securities in our non-qualified deferred compensation plans. The investment results of our non-qualified deferred compensation plans do not affect our net income as there is an equal and offsetting impact in our compensation and benefits expense. Investment income is influenced by the availability of funds generated by operations, market interest rates and changes in the levels of cash performance bonds deposited by clearing firms. • Securities lending transactions utilize a portion of the securities that clearing firms deposit to satisfy their proprietary performance bond requirements. Substantial interest expense is also incurred as part of this securities lending activity. Net interest income from securities lending is impacted by changes in short-term interest rates and the level of demand for the securities available for loan. • Interest expense is due primarily to a commercial paper program with various financial institutions initiated in September 2007 in conjunction with a tender offer to repurchase Class A common stock. Under the program, we may sell unsecured short-term promissory notes. • Expense related to our guarantee of exercise right privileges (ERPs) is a result of our merger with CBOT Holdings. Under the terms of the merger agreement, eligible holders of CBOE ERPs could elect to sell us their ERP for $250,000 per privilege. Eligible holders that did not elect to sell their ERPs are entitled to a maximum guaranteed payment of $250,000 from us upon resolution of the lawsuit between CBOT and CBOE. This expense represents the estimated fair value of our guarantee as of the end of the period, which is based in part on the expected outcome of the litigation. Periodic expense is impacted by changes in the fair value of the ERP. • Equity in losses of unconsolidated subsidiaries includes losses from our investments in FXMS and OneChicago. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The notes to our consolidated financial statements include disclosure of our significant accounting policies. In establishing these policies within the framework of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, management must make certain assessments, estimates and choices that will result in the application of these principles in a manner that appropriately reflects our financial condition and results of operations. Critical accounting policies are those policies that we believe present the most complex or subjective measurements and have the most potential to affect our financial position and operating results. While all decisions regarding accounting policies are important, there are certain accounting policies that we consider to be critical. These critical policies, which are presented in detail in the notes to our consolidated financial statements, relate to goodwill and intangible assets, revenue recognition, income taxes, internal use software costs and stock-based compensation. Goodwill and intangible assets. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,” we review goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment on an annual basis and whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. The provisions of SFAS No. 142 require that a two-step impairment test be performed on goodwill. In the first step, the fair value of each reporting unit is compared to its carrying amount. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying amount, no impairment exists and we are not required to perform further testing. If the carrying amount exceeds its fair value, the second step must be performed to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill. If the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, then an impairment loss is recorded in an amount equal to that excess. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are assessed for impairment by comparing their fair values to their carrying values. If the carrying value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the difference. 56 Table of Contents Intangible assets subject to amortization are also evaluated for impairment, when indicated by a change in circumstances, pursuant to SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.” The impairment testing requires management to estimate the fair value of the assets and record an impairment loss for the excess of the carrying value over the fair value. The estimate of the fair value of all intangible assets is generally determined on the basis of discounted future cash flows. In estimating the fair value, management must make assumptions and projections regarding such items as future cash flows, future revenues, future earnings and other factors. Such assumptions are subject to change as a result of changing economic and competitive conditions. Revenue recognition. Our revenue recognition policies comply with Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101 on revenue recognition. Our revenue is derived primarily from the clearing and transaction fees we assess on each contract executed through our trading venues and cleared through our clearing house. Clearing and transaction fees are recognized as revenue when a buy and sell order are matched and when the trade is cleared. On occasion, the customer’s exchange trading privileges may not be properly entered by the clearing firm and incorrect fees are charged for the transactions in the affected accounts. When this information is corrected within the time period allowed by the exchange, a fee adjustment is provided to the clearing firm. An accrual is established for estimated fee adjustments to reflect corrections to customer exchange trading privileges. The accrual is based on the historical pattern of adjustments processed as well as specific adjustment requests. Occasionally, market data customers will pay for services in a lump sum payment. When these circumstances occur, revenue is recognized as services are provided. Income taxes. Calculation of the income tax provision includes an estimate of the income taxes that will be paid for the current year as well as an estimate of income tax liabilities or benefits deferred into future years, as determined in accordance with SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes” and Financial Interpretation (FIN) No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertain Tax Positions.” As required, our deferred tax assets are reviewed to determine if all assets will be realized in future periods. To the extent it is determined that some deferred tax assets may not be fully realized, the assets must be reduced by a valuation allowance. The calculation of our tax provision involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. We recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the United States and other applicable tax jurisdictions using a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold based on the technical merits of the tax position taken or expected to be taken. If payment of these amounts varies from our estimate, our income tax provision would be reduced or increased at the time that determination is made. This determination may not be known for several years. Past tax audits have not resulted in tax adjustments that would result in a material change to the income tax provision in the year the audit was completed. The effective tax rate, defined as the income tax provision as a percentage of income before income taxes, will vary from year to year based on changes to tax rates and regulations. In addition, the effective tax rate will vary with changes to income that are not subject to income tax, such as municipal interest income, and changes in expenses or losses that are not deductible, such as the utilization of foreign net operating losses. Internal use software costs. Certain costs for employees and consultants that are incurred in connection with work on development or implementation of software for our internal use are capitalized in accordance with the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement of Position (SOP) 98-1, “Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use.” Costs capitalized are for application development or implementation, as required by SOP 98-1, for software projects that will result in significant new functionality and that are generally expected to cost in excess of $0.5 million. The amount capitalized is determined based on the time spent by the individuals completing the eligible software-related activity and the compensation and benefits or consulting fees incurred for these activities. Projects are monitored during the development cycle to assure that they continue to meet the capitalization criteria of SOP 98-1 and that the project will be completed and placed in service as intended. Any previously capitalized costs are expensed at the time a decision is made to abandon a software project. Completed internal use software projects, as well as work-in-progress projects, are included as part of property in the consolidated balance sheets. Once completed, the accumulated costs for a particular software project are amortized over the anticipated life of the software, generally three years. Costs capitalized for internal use software will vary from year to year based on our technology-related business requirements. 57 Table of Contents Stock-based compensation. We expense stock options using the fair value method under the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R), “Share-Based Payment.” We have elected the accelerated method for recognizing the expense related to stock grants. Due to this election and the vesting provisions of our stock grants, a greater percentage of the total expense is recognized in the first and second years of the vesting period than would be recorded if we used the straight-line method. Upon adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) on January 1, 2006, we began to include an estimate of expected forfeitures of stock grants in our expense recognition calculations instead of the previous practice of accounting for forfeitures as they occurred. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements,” which provides guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities by defining fair value, establishing a framework for measuring fair value, and expanding disclosures about fair value measurements. The provisions of this statement are effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. Adoption of this standard will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements, but will require additional disclosures beginning in the first quarter of 2008. The FASB issued SFAS No. 159, “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities—Including an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 115,” in February 2007. SFAS No. 159 permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. The provisions of this statement are effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. The impact of the adoption will be dependent on the extent to which we elect to measure eligible items at fair value. We did not elect to measure any items at fair value upon our initial adoption of the standard. SFAS No. 141(R), “Business Combinations,” was issued in December 2007 to replace SFAS No. 141, “Business Combinations.” SFAS No. 141(R) requires that an acquirer recognize the assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any non-controlling interest in the acquiree at the acquisition date, measured at their fair values as of that date. This new statement also changes the requirements for recognizing assets acquired and liabilities assumed arising from contingencies, restructuring liabilities and acquisition costs. The provisions of this statement are applied prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2008. We are currently assessing the impact of this standard’s future adoption on our financial statements. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, “Non-controlling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements,” which establishes accounting and reporting standards for the non-controlling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. SFAS No. 160 clarifies that a non-controlling interest in a subsidiary be reported as equity in the consolidated financial statements. The provisions require consolidated net income to be reported at the total amount attributable to both the parent and non-controlling interest, with disclosure of the amount attributable to the parent and non-controlling interest on the face of the statement of income. The statement also requires that a parent recognize a gain or loss in net income when a subsidiary is deconsolidated. This statement is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2008 and is applied prospectively as of the beginning of the fiscal year in which the statement is initially applied. We are currently assessing the impact of this standard’s future adoption on our financial statements. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR 2007 COMPARED WITH 2006 2007 Financial Highlights The comparability of our operating results for 2007 compared with 2006 is significantly impacted by our merger with CBOT Holdings. In our discussion and analysis of comparative periods, we have quantified the contribution of additional revenue or expense resulting from the merger wherever such amounts were material and identifiable. While identified amounts may provide indications of general trends, the analysis cannot completely address the effects attributable to integration efforts. • Total operating revenues grew by 61% in 2007 with the most significant increase in clearing and transaction fees revenue and quotation data fees. • Total operating expenses increased by 50% due primarily to higher compensation and benefits costs, amortization of purchased intangibles and additional technology expenses incurred to maintain the e-CBOT electronic trading platform. 58 Table of Contents Legal proceedings resulting from our merger with CBOT Holdings, including settlement costs paid in relation to a claim filed by the Louisiana Municipal Police Employees’ Retirement System (LAMPERS), and other merger-related costs also contributed to increased expenses in 2007. During the third quarter of 2007, we began the process of restructuring our staffing, technology and facilities as a result of the merger. At that time, we began incurring restructuring charges and will continue to incur additional expense in 2008. • Operating margin, which we define as operating income expressed as a percentage of total revenues, increased to 60% in 2007 compared with 57% in 2006 as the growth in operating revenues outpaced increases in operating expenses. • The increase in non-operating expense was due primarily to the guarantee we provided to eligible holders of the CBOE’s ERPs. The increase in non-operating expense was partially offset by an increase in investment income due primarily to an increase in average operating funds available for investment. • Cash earnings increased by $241.0 million to $643.8 million for 2007 compared with 2006 due primarily to an increase in net income. We have included a reconciliation of cash earnings, a non-GAAP measure, in Liquidity and Capital Resources. Operating Revenues (dollars in millions) 2007 2006 Change Clearing and transaction fees $ 1,427.3 $ 866.1 65 % Quotation data fees 145.1 80.8 79 Processing services 106.4 90.2 18 Access and communication fees 35.8 28.7 25 Other 41.5 24.1 72 Total Revenues $ 1,756.1 $ 1,089.9 61 Clearing and Transaction Fees. Revenue increased primarily due to growth in trading volume partially offset by a decrease in average rate per contract. Volume The addition of the CBOT product line contributed significantly to an increase in overall trading volume during 2007. We also believe that a significant increase in volatility, generated in part from uncertainty surrounding the sub-prime debt market during 2007, added to an increase in volume across all product lines. 59 Table of Contents The following table summarizes average daily trading volume. For comparative purposes, CME and CBOT products have been presented separately and average daily volume for CBOT products has been calculated for the period from July 13, 2007 through December 31, 2007. All amounts exclude TRAKRS, Swapstream and auction-traded products. (in thousands) 2007 2006 Change Product Line Average Daily Volume: Interest rate: CME 3,701 3,078 20 % CBOT 3,392 — n.m. Equity: CME 2,549 1,734 47 % CBOT 195 — n.m. Foreign exchange: CME 569 453 26 % Commodity and alternative investment: CME 81 78 5 % CBOT 647 — n.m. Average Daily Volume of Total Products: CME 6,900 5,343 29 % CBOT 4,234 — n.m. Electronic Volume: CME 5,288 3,808 39 % CBOT 3,373 — n.m. Electronic Volume as a Percentage of Total Average Daily Volume 78 % 71 % n.m. not meaningful Interest Rate Products The increase in interest rate trading volume is due primarily to the addition of CBOT interest rate products subsequent to the merger. CBOT interest rate products volume is attributable primarily to 10-year and 5-year U.S. Treasury note futures and options, which had average daily volume of 1.7 million and 0.8 million contracts, respectively, from July 13, 2007 through the end of the year. Average daily volume for 10-year and 5-year U.S. Treasury note futures and options was 1.3 million and 0.5 million contracts, respectively, for the last six months of 2006. CBOT product volume for 2006 is provided for comparative purposes only and does not relate to revenues recognized by CME Group. Overall trading volume growth in interest rate products also resulted from uncertainty surrounding inflation and market interest rates as well as concerns about the sub-prime debt market, which generated additional market volatility. CME Eurodollar futures traded electronically increased to an average of 2.2 million contracts per day in 2007, an increase of 30% when compared with 2006. Additionally, volume for CME Eurodollar options traded via open outcry increased 14% to an average of 1.1 million contracts per day in 2007. Equity Products Trading volume for equity products increased for the year due primarily to a sharp rise in volatility in the equity markets resulting from sub-prime debt market and inflationary concerns, especially during the second half of 2007. Average volatility, as measured by the CBOE Volatility Index, increased by 77% in the last six months of 2007 compared with the same period in 2006. Average daily volume of our E-mini equity products increased by 50% to 2.4 million contracts in 2007 compared with 2006. This included an increase in average daily volume for E-mini S&P 500 futures and options contracts of 60% to 1.7 million contracts in 2007. As announced in June 2007, our license to list Russell-based contracts will terminate in September 2008 when the last contracts currently traded expire. Average daily volume for the Russell-based contracts was 252,000 for 2007. On June 19, 2007, we launched new E-mini S&P small cap futures and options contracts, based on the S&P 600 Index, to offer a comparable alternative to the Russell-based contracts. In August 2007, we renewed our licensing agreement with Dow Jones. The agreement enables us to continue to exclusively offer futures and options on futures products based on the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) and other Dow Jones indexes. The new agreement is effective January 1, 2008 through December 31, 2014 and also includes a provision for a five-year renewal term and successive annual renewal terms thereafter. Foreign Exchange Products The increase in trading of foreign exchange products was fueled in part by the decline of the U.S. dollar relative to other major currencies. We believe that market reactions to events in the fixed income market also contributed to volume growth during the year. In 2007, 92% of our foreign exchange volume traded electronically compared with 88% during 2006. Commodities and Alternative Investments Trading volume growth during 2007 resulted primarily from the additional volume generated from CBOT commodities subsequent to the merger. CBOT commodities consist primarily of corn and soybean futures and options. 60 Table of Contents Average Rate Per Contract The increase in average daily volume in 2007 was partially offset by a decrease in the average rate, or revenue, per contract. All amounts in the following table exclude TRAKRS, Swapstream and auction-traded products. 2007 2006 Change Total Volume (in millions) 2,249.6 1,341.1 68 % Clearing and Transaction Fees (in millions) $ 1,426.2 $ 864.4 65 Average Rate per Contract $ 0.634 $ 0.645 (2 ) The average rate per contract decreased in 2007 due primarily to growth in member trading when compared with 2006. Member trading volume increased faster than non-member trading in 2007. We believe that higher volumes by automated trading systems, which typically receive member rates, contributed to this increase in member trading. In addition, the average rate per contract of the E-mini S&P 500 futures and options contracts decreased due to incremental volume reaching the CME Globex surcharge cap, resulting in a decrease in the overall average rate per contract. The decrease in average rate per contract was partially offset by the addition of CBOT products to our existing product lines. The average rate per contract for CBOT products was $0.657 for the period July 13 through December 31, 2007. The increase in average rate per contract is attributable primarily to an increase in commodities volume, which has a higher average rate per contract, during the fourth quarter of 2007. Additionally, the percentage of total volume by product line shifted during the year from CME interest rate products to E-mini equity products, which have a higher rate per contract. As a percentage of total volume, E-mini equity volume increased by 5% in 2007 when compared with 2006 while interest rate product volume decreased by 4%. Concentration of Revenue We bill a substantial portion of our clearing and transaction fees to our clearing firms. The majority of clearing and transaction fees received from clearing firms represent charges for trades executed on behalf of their customers. We currently have approximately 120 clearing firms. The increase in the number of clearing firms compared with the prior year is due to the addition of CBOT-only clearing firms as a result of our merger. One firm represented approximately 11% of our clearing and transaction fee revenue for 2007. Should a clearing firm discontinue operations, we believe the customer portion of that firm’s trading activity would likely transfer to another clearing firm of the exchange. Therefore, we do not believe this concentration exposes us to significant risk from the loss of revenue earned from the particular firm. Quotation Data Fees. Quotation data fees revenue increased mostly due to additional revenue of approximately $44.1 million contributed by market data services provided to existing CBOT customers subsequent to the merger. In addition, a fee increase in CME market data fees on January 1, 2007 also contributed to growth in revenue. Users of CME’s basic service paid $50 per month in 2007 for each market data screen, or device, compared with $40 per month in 2006. The higher rate combined with increases in other quotation data services contributed to additional revenue of $19.2 million in 2007 compared with 2006. Effective January 1, 2008, all users of our basic services will pay $55 per month for each market data screen, or device. The two largest resellers of our market data generated approximately 67% of our quotation data fees revenue in 2007. However, we consider exposure to significant risk of revenue loss to be minimal despite this concentration. In the event one of these vendors no longer subscribes to our market data, we believe the majority of that vendor’s customers would likely subscribe to our market data through another reseller. 61 Table of Contents Processing Services. The increase in revenues is attributable primarily to an increase in NYMEX volume. Revenues generated from trade matching services provided to NYMEX, which began at the end of the second quarter of 2006, increased by $42.1 million in 2007 when compared with 2006. The total volume of NYMEX products available on the CME Globex platform increased to 191.5 million contracts in 2007 from 35.6 million contracts in 2006. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in revenue resulting from the elimination of fees generated by the clearing agreement with CBOT, which terminated as a result of our merger with CBOT Holdings. The decrease in processing services revenue resulting from this termination was $27.6 million in 2007 when compared with 2006. Access and Communication Fees. The telecommunications services provided to CBOT customers as well as connectivity charges for the e-CBOT trading platform contributed incremental revenue of approximately $4.8 million in 2007. In addition, revenue growth in 2007 was also attributable to customers upgrading to higher bandwidth connections and expansion of our server co-location program. The co-location program allows customers to connect their trading applications directly to the CME Globex electronic platform by housing certain customer systems in a CME-specified data facility. Other Revenues. Rental income and associated revenues from building operations acquired as a result of the merger with CBOT Holdings totaled $11.2 million in 2007. Other incremental revenues from CBOT totaled $2.3 million. Additionally, the increase in other revenues is also attributable to a $2.6 million increase in GFX trading gains in 2007 when compared with 2006. Operating Expenses (dollars in millions) 2007 2006 Change Compensation and benefits $ 263.3 $ 203.0 30 % Communications 43.5 31.6 38 Technology support services 50.5 31.2 62 Professional fees and outside services 53.1 33.2 60 Amortization of purchased intangibles 33.9 1.3 n.m.

Other 62.9 40.5 55 Total Expenses $ 705.6 $ 468.9 50 n.m. not meaningful Compensation and Benefits. The increase in compensation and benefits expense during 2007 compared with 2006 consisted primarily of the following: (in millions) Increases Average headcount $ 37.2 Bonus 11.9 Stock-based compensation 6.5 Change in average salaries, benefits and employer taxes 3.8 • Average headcount increased by 23%, or about 320 employees, in 2007. This increase resulted primarily from the addition of approximately 690 employees as a result of our merger with CBOT Holdings and was offset by a workforce reduction of about 180 employees during the third and fourth quarters of 2007. As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, we had approximately 1,970 and 1,430 employees, respectively. • Bonus expense accrued under the provisions of our annual incentive plan increased in 2007 mostly as a result of a larger target pool due to growth in headcount; improved performance of our company when compared with the cash earnings target, and increased salary levels. • Stock-based compensation increased primarily due to the full impact in 2007 of the expense related to the options granted in June 2006 and additional expense related to the June 2007 grant. In addition, we recognized additional expense for the unvested stock options previously granted to CBOT Holdings’ employees. 62 Table of Contents Subsequent to our merger, we approved and initiated a plan to close duplicate facilities and reduce our workforce in order to improve operating efficiencies. In addition to the positions we have eliminated through December 2007, we expect to eliminate approximately 200 positions by June 2008. We expect these reductions to contribute to a decrease in compensation and benefits expense relative to the current period. Communications. This expense increased primarily as a result of our merger with CBOT Holdings. Costs incurred to support e-CBOT operations and customer connectivity resulted in incremental expense in 2007. Continued growth in existing customer and data center connections and bandwidth upgrades also contributed to the increase in expense in 2007. Technology Support Services. There was an increase of approximately $15.1 million due primarily to the integration and support of the e-CBOT electronic trading platform in 2007. Additional investments in technology, including an upgrade to our network and mainframe system in 2006, led to increased ongoing maintenance costs as part of a planned system expansion to increase capacity for peak volumes of transactions processed electronically. Professional Fees and Outside Services. Technology-related and other professional fees, net of amounts capitalized for internally developed software, increased by $11.2 million in 2007 compared with 2006. The increase was due primarily to consulting services used to supplement our merger integration efforts as well as non-capitalizable software development costs and expenses incurred to support our strategic initiatives. Additionally, legal fees increased $6.3 million in 2007 due to litigation costs related to the LAMPERS and CBOE proceedings resulting from our merger with CBOT Holdings, as well as the ongoing antitrust suit filed by Eurex U.S. In total, this expense category includes $8.9 million in merger-related costs in 2007. Amortization of Purchased Intangibles. The increase in expense during 2007 is attributable to intangible assets obtained in our merger with CBOT Holdings. Intangible assets subject to amortization consist primarily of clearing firm relationships, market data customer relationships, the Dow Jones licensing agreement and lease-related intangibles. Amortization of purchased intangibles in 2006 relates to intangible assets obtained as a result of our business acquisition of Swapstream and our acquisition of assets from Liquidity Direct Technology, LLC. Depreciation and Amortization. The increase in expense is related primarily to additional assets obtained in our recent merger with CBOT Holdings. Depreciation and amortization expense attributable to the addition of these assets was estimated as $18.6 million in 2007. This amount includes the impact of purchase accounting valuation adjustments. In addition, we have shortened the useful lives of various technology-related and trading floor assets due to our plans to consolidate some electronic trading systems and trading floor operations. This resulted in incremental expense of $7.9 million in 2007. We expect this acceleration of depreciation to result in $8.0 million of expense in 2008. In addition, depreciation and amortization of 2007 and 2006 property additions exceeded the depreciation and amortization of assets that have become fully depreciated or retired since January 1, 2006, contributing to the increase in depreciation and amortization expense for 2007. Property additions, excluding merger-related additions, for 2007 and 2006 are summarized below. Technology-related assets include purchases of computers and related equipment, software, the cost of developing internal use software and the build-out of our data centers. While total property additions increased in 2007, technology-related spending decreased as a percentage of total additions due to an increase in spending for the development of our newly-leased Chicago office space. (dollars in millions) 2007 2006 Change Total property additions, including landlord-funded leasehold improvements $ 163.7 $ 88.2 86 % Technology-related assets as a percentage of total additions 77 % 90 % Occupancy and Building Operations. The addition of three commercial real estate properties as a result of our recent merger resulted in incremental expense of $8.4 million in 2007 relating primarily to utilities, maintenance and real estate tax expense. In addition, we entered into two leases for additional office space in Chicago and London during the third quarter of 2006. These new leases contributed to an increase of $10.2 million in rent, utilities and real estate tax expense in 2007. In August 2007, we renegotiated the leases for office space and trading floor facilities at our headquarters. Under the terms of our new lease, which extends our occupancy through 2022, we will be reducing our rented space after November 2008. 63 Table of Contents Licensing and Other Fee Agreements. Higher trading volume for licensed products, particularly E-mini S&P products, resulted in $8.8 million of additional expense in 2007. Also contributing to an increase in this expense were licensing and market maker fees of approximately $4.1 million resulting from our recent merger with CBOT Holdings. These increases were partially offset by a $2.7 million reduction in costs incurred under a fee sharing arrangement with SGX, which ceased in February 2007 under the terms of our renewed agreement. We renewed our exclusive product licensing agreement with Dow Jones in September 2007. The new agreement is effective from January 2008 through December 2014 and includes an upfront payment as well as minimum annual payments. The upfront payment, which was negotiated in exchange for a reduced rate per contract, will be recognized in equal amounts each month over the term of the agreement. Restructuring. This expense consists primarily of severance to transitional CBOT employees, severance to CME employees, retention bonuses and associated payroll taxes as well as outplacement costs and post-employment healthcare subsidies. Approximately $3.5 million of additional restructuring expense will be incurred in 2008. Other Expense. The increase in expense for 2007 is attributable primarily to $8.0 million of marketing, advertising and public relations costs incurred as part of our global brand campaign and efforts to redesign and expand our customer education programs. Included in the $8.0 million increase for 2007 was $3.9 million of merger-related re-branding and print advertising costs. Also contributing to the increase in other expense for the year was $6.3 million of settlement costs related to the LAMPERS class action lawsuit. Finally, a higher level of operating expenses associated with the combined company resulted in an increase in this expense for the year. Non-Operating Income and Expense (dollars in millions) 2007 2006 Change Investment income $ 73.1 $ 55.8 31 % Securities lending interest income 121.5 94.0 29 Securities lending interest expense (114.5 ) (92.1 ) 24 Interest expense (3.6 ) (0.2 ) n.m. Guarantee of exercise right privileges (17.2 ) — n.m. Equity in losses of unconsolidated subsidiaries (14.0 ) (6.9 ) n.m. Total Non-Operating $ 45.3 $ 50.6 (10 ) n.m. not meaningful Investment Income. The increase in investment income in 2007 when compared with 2006 is attributable primarily to the investment of additional cash generated from operations during the year as well as rising short-term interest rates. In late 2007, cash was utilized for a share repurchase and interest rates began to decline resulting in a decline in the investment income growth rate we had experienced earlier in the year. Funds from maturing investments have been reinvested in liquid, short-term investments due to the uncertainty surrounding long-term interest rates and to provide flexibility in pursuing strategic opportunities. Annualized average rates of return and average investment balances indicated in the table below include short-term investments classified as cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and a portion of clearing firms’ cash performance bonds and security deposits, but exclude the impact of our non-qualified deferred compensation plan and insurance contracts. We exclude the impact of our non-qualified deferred compensation plan from this analysis because earnings from the plan are offset by an equal amount of expense in compensation and benefits expense. (dollars in millions) 2007 2006 Change Annualized average rate of return 4.46 % 4.16 % 0.30 % Average investment balance $ 1,563.9 $ 1,294.1 $ 269.8 Increase in income due to balance $ 11.3 Increase in income due to rate 4.7 Securities Lending. During 2007, we expanded lending relationships to include additional banks, which led to an increase in the number of eligible securities available for lending. Beginning in late August 2007, we temporarily suspended our securities lending program due to high volatility in the credit markets and extreme market demand for U.S. Treasury securities, resulting in a decline of 64 Table of Contents the revenue and expense growth rate we had experienced earlier in the year. We resumed the program in mid-September once market volatility subsided. Despite the temporary suspension of the program in 2007, the expansion of lending relationships resulted in an increase in the average daily balance of funds invested when compared with 2006. The spread between the average rate earned and the average rate paid increased during 2007 due to the combined effect of changes in the federal discount rate, which correlates closely with the interest expense, and an increase in market demand for the securities we had available to lend through this program. (dollars in billions) 2007 2006 Change Average daily balance of funds invested $ 2.3 $ 1.9 $ 0.4 Annualized average rate earned 5.27 % 5.01 % 0.26 % Annualized average rate paid 4.96 4.91 0.05 Net earned from securities lending 0.31 0.10 0.21 Interest Expense. In September 2007, we initiated a commercial paper program with various institutions under which we may issue and sell unsecured short-term promissory notes. During 2007, we issued $1.2 billion in par value of commercial paper notes. At December 31, 2007, $164.4 million of debt remained outstanding. The weighted average balance of notes outstanding for the full year was $64.2 million. Interest rates on notes issued ranged from 4.50% to 5.38%. Guarantee of Exercise Right Privileges. Under the terms of the merger with CBOT Holdings, eligible holders of CBOE ERPs had until August 24, 2007 to elect to sell us their ERPs for $250,000 per privilege. Upon resolution of the lawsuit between CBOT and CBOE, qualified holders that did not elect to sell are entitled to a maximum guaranteed payment of $250,000 per privilege. If the value received by the ERP holder upon resolution of the lawsuit is less than $250,000, we will pay the difference. We recorded expense equal to the estimated fair value of the guarantee on 1,331 ERPs outstanding at the close of the merger. In August 2007, 159 ERPs were tendered for sale to us. We have reflected changes in the estimated fair value of the guarantee on the ERPs that remain outstanding and adjusted our expense accordingly. We will continue to recognize changes in the fair value of the outstanding guarantee as income or expense on a quarterly basis until the lawsuit is resolved. Subsequent to the tendering of these rights, the maximum potential aggregate payment to the remaining holders under the guarantee is $293.0 million. Equity in Losses of Unconsolidated Subsidiaries. The increase resulted primarily from incremental losses of $7.1 million from our investment in FXMS for 2007. FXMS, our joint venture with Reuters, was established in the second half of 2006 and began operations in February 2007. Income Tax Provision The effective tax rate increased to 39.9% in 2007 from 39.4% in 2006. The increase was due primarily to the inability to recognize the benefit of the net operating losses generated by our Swapstream operations, which we acquired in August 2006. The valuation allowance recorded against Swapstream’s accumulated net operating losses will not be derecognized until there is a pattern of operating income from these operations. The increase in the effective tax rate was partially offset by an increase in tax-advantaged securities. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR 2006 COMPARED WITH 2005 2006 Financial Highlights • Total operating revenues grew by 22% in 2006 primarily as a result of increased clearing and transaction fees revenue, and to a lesser extent, processing services and quotation data fees. • Total operating expenses increased by 14% in 2006 when compared with 2005. The increase was due primarily to higher compensation and benefits costs as well as increased technology spending resulting from capacity expansion and processing speed enhancements. Higher rates on licensed S&P and NASDAQ products and increased professional and outside services fees also contributed to the increase in expenses. • Operating margin, which we define as operating income expressed as a percentage of total revenues, increased to 57% in 2006 from 54% in 2005 as the growth of operating revenues outpaced increases in operating expenses. • The increase in non-operating income was due primarily to an increase in investment income, which resulted from a rise in average operating funds available for investment and increases in market interest rates. 65 Table of Contents • Cash earnings increased by approximately $111.0 million to $402.8 million for 2006 compared with 2005. We have included a reconciliation of cash earnings, a non-GAAP measure, in Liquidity and Capital Resources. Operating Revenues (dollars in millions) 2006 2005 Change Clearing and transaction fees $ 866.1 $ 696.2 24 % Quotation data fees 80.8 71.8 13 Processing services 90.2 68.7 31 Access and communication fees 28.7 27.8 3 Other 24.1 25.3 (4 ) Total Revenues $ 1,089.9 $ 889.8 22 Clearing and Transaction Fees. The increase was due to trading volume growth partially offset by a decrease in the average rate per contract. Volume In 2006, our volume surpassed one billion contracts traded for the second consecutive year driven by growth of 25% or more in all product lines. Technology enhancements, including the migration of our CME Globex trading platform to new Hewlett Packard Integrity NonStop servers that incorporate Intel Itanium processors, significantly increased trade-matching speed which reduced our average response time on transactions and resulted in increased usage by automated trading systems. Growth in hedge funds, interest rate uncertainty and occasional daily volatility in equity markets also contributed to trading volume growth. The following table summarizes average daily trading volume. All amounts exclude TRAKRS, Swapstream and auction-traded products. (in thousands) 2006 2005 Change Product Line Average Daily Volume: Interest rate 3,078 2,380 29 % Equity 1,734 1,389 25 Foreign exchange 453 334 35 Commodity and alternative investment 78 55 41 Average Daily Volume of Total Products 5,343 4,158 28 Electronic Volume 3,808 2,895 31 Electronic Volume as a Percentage of Total Average Daily Volume 71 % 70 % Interest Rate Products Interest rate product volume increased in 2006 due primarily to uncertain market expectations surrounding interest rates, including those created by changes in Federal Reserve monetary policy, expansion in the use of our electronic trading platform as a result of technological enhancement and increased use of automated trading systems. The volume of interest rate products traded electronically increased by 34% to 1.8 million contracts per day in 2006. Trends favoring the trading of derivative products also contributed to the increase in volume. The average daily volume of CME Eurodollar options, which are traded predominantly through open outcry, increased by 44% to 1.1 million contracts in 2006. In conjunction with the increase in Eurodollar options volume, the average daily volume of CME Eurodollar options traded electronically also increased to 77,000 contracts in 2006 from 28,000 contracts in 2005. In April 2006, we launched a new incentive program to increase electronic trading of CME Eurodollar options. The program, which was initially effective through December 2006, was extended through June 2007. The program provided a reduced fee schedule for customers meeting percentage thresholds for electronic trading of CME Eurodollar options. 66 Table of Contents Equity Products The increase in equity product volume for the year was due primarily to technological enhancements, increased usage of equity option products, occasional significant daily fluctuations in stock market volatility, as measured by the CBOE Volatility Index, and efforts to attract new customers. Average daily volume of our E-mini equity products increased by 25% to 1.6 million contracts in 2006 compared with 2005. In particular, E-mini S&P 500 volume increased 27% to 1.1 million contracts. Volume for our electronically traded E-mini equity options increased to 45,000 contracts per day in 2006 from 18,000 contracts per day in 2005. Foreign Exchange Products In December 2006, foreign exchange volume set a monthly volume record with 621,000 contracts traded per day. The increase in trading of foreign exchange products resulted from the previously mentioned technological enhancements which facilitated faster execution of trades, additional liquidity and fee incentive programs, including those specifically targeted to attract commodity trading advisors and large hedge funds. In 2006, 88% of our foreign exchange volume traded through the CME Globex platform compared with 81% during 2005. Commodity and Alternative Investment Products Trading in commodity and alternative investment products increased as a result of the growing appeal of commodities as an asset class, which has attracted additional trading activity in live cattle and lean hog products. Average Rate Per Contract The impact of the 28% increase in average daily trading volume during 2006 was partially offset by a decrease in the average rate, or revenue, per contract. All amounts in the following table exclude TRAKRS, Swapstream and auction-traded products. 2006 2005 Change Total Volume (in millions) 1,341.1 1,047.9 28 % Clearing and Transaction Fees (in millions) $ 864.4 $ 695.7 24 Average Rate per Contract $ 0.645 $ 0.664 (3 ) In 2006, the average rate per contract decreased when compared with 2005 due primarily to the following factors: • Incentives and discounts increased as a result of volume growth, reducing the average rate per contract by $0.021; • The number of inactive clearing firms and trading volume from automated trading systems that receive lower-priced member rates increased resulting in a slight rise in the percentage of trades executed by member customers to 80% of total volume from 79% in 2005; • Higher-priced privately negotiated trades, as a percentage of total volume, decreased to 1.0% during 2006 compared with 1.2% in 2005; and • The average daily volume of CME Eurodollar options traded through open outcry, one of our lowest priced products, increased by 38%. This represented 19% of total volume in 2006 compared with 17% in 2005. Clearing and transaction fees from CME Eurodollar options traded through open outcry averaged $0.33 per contract in 2006 and 2005. These decreases were partially offset by broad-based pricing increases implemented in August 2005, which contributed incremental revenue of approximately $13.0 million when compared with 2005. Additionally, the rate per contract was favorably impacted by a higher percentage of trades executed through the CME Globex platform for which additional fees are assessed. Quotation Data Fees. The growth in revenue resulted primarily from a fee increase that was implemented on January 1, 2006. Users of our basic service paid $40 per month for each market data screen, or device in 2006. The monthly charge in effect during 2005 was $35. This higher rate contributed to a $10.4 million increase in subscriber fees for 2006 compared with 2005 and was partially offset by a $1.5 million decrease in assessments, which result from our periodic audits of usage data previously provided by our customers. 67 Table of Contents Processing Services. Revenue increased primarily as a result of increased trading volume at CBOT and higher volume executed on the CME Globex platform under our agreement with NYMEX. CBOT’s average daily trading volume was 3.2 million contracts for 2006, an increase of 20% over the 2.7 million contracts traded in 2005. This increased volume at CBOT generated incremental revenue of $11.6 million in 2006. Revenue from services provided to NYMEX increased by $9.8 million in 2006 when compared with 2005. Our prior agreement with NYMEX ended in November 2005. Trading under our new 10-year agreement began in June 2006. The new agreement added metals futures products and expanded the number of energy futures products, including the addition of physically delivered WTI futures products, which we now list for NYMEX on the CME Globex platform. As a result, the average daily volume of NYMEX electronic trading increased significantly on our platform during 2006. Access Fees. Growth in revenue resulted from the expiration, in July 2006, of an incentive program to encourage our customers to switch to a higher bandwidth connection. Operating Expenses (dollars in millions) 2006 2005 Change Compensation and benefits $ 203.0 $ 179.6 13 % Communications 31.6 31.1 2 Technology support services 31.2 26.9 16 Professional fees and outside services 33.2 26.1 27 Amortization of purchased intangibles 1.3 0.7 73 Depreciation and amortization 72.8 64.9 12 Occupancy and building operations 29.6 28.5 4 Licensing and other fee agreements 25.7 18.0 43 Other 40.5 36.0 13 Total Expenses $ 468.9 $ 411.8 14 Compensation and Benefits. The increase in compensation and benefits expense during 2006 relative to 2005 consisted primarily of the following: (in millions) Increases Average headcount $ 9.8 Change in average salaries, benefits and employer taxes 7.4 Bonus 4.3 Stock-based compensation 3.8 Capitalization for software development and reimbursable costs (3.6 ) • Average headcount increased by 7%, or approximately 90 employees, in 2006 compared with 2005 primarily as a result of increased hiring to support technology initiatives. Our acquisition of Swapstream, which was completed in August 2006, also contributed to the increase in average headcount for the year. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, we had approximately 1,430 and 1,320 employees, respectively. • Bonus expense accrued under the provisions of our annual incentive plan increased due primarily to growth in our employee headcount and salary increases for existing employees. • Stock-based compensation increased primarily as a result of additional expense from options granted in June 2006 and the full impact in 2006 of the expense related to the June 2005 grant. In addition, the fair value per share of options granted in June 2006 increased when compared with the fair value of options granted in June 2005. • Increases were partially offset by increased capitalization of compensation and benefits expense relating to software development. The increase in capitalized software costs resulted primarily from development needed to provide trading and other services to FXMS. Technology Support Services. We experienced growth of 20% in the average number of transactions processed electronically during 2006 when compared with 2005. As a result of the continued growth in transactions processed, additional maintenance and service contracts were required to support increases in hardware and software purchases. 68 Table of Contents Professional Fees and Outside Services. Legal fees increased $4.1 million in 2006 when compared with 2005 due primarily to the structuring and establishment of FXMS and litigation costs related to the ongoing antitrust lawsuit filed by Eurex U.S. in 2003. In addition, other professional fees increased $3.4 million in 2006 due primarily to the use of consulting services to support several clearing and trading systems projects as well as enhancements to the CME Globex platform’s functionality, including the ability to execute complex options trading strategies. During the fourth quarter, merger-related integration planning also contributed to an increase in professional fees. Depreciation and Amortization. During the second quarter of 2006, we began an 18-month process of migrating the electronic trading of products to new Hewlett Packard Integrity NonStop servers that incorporate Intel Itanium processors. As a result of the migration, we reassessed and shortened the estimated useful lives on our existing processors which resulted in additional depreciation expense of $1.9 million in 2006 when compared with 2005. In addition, depreciation and amortization of 2005 and 2006 property additions exceeded the depreciation and amortization of assets that have become fully depreciated or retired since January 1, 2005, resulting in an increase in 2006 depreciation and amortization expense. Property additions for 2006 and 2005 are summarized below. Technology-related assets include purchases of computers and related equipment, software, the cost of developing internal use software and costs associated with the expansion of our data centers. (dollars in millions) 2006 2005 Change Total property additions, including landlord-funded leasehold improvements $ 88.2 $ 87.6 — % Technology-related assets as a percentage of total additions 90 % 91 % Occupancy and Building Operations. We entered into two new leases for additional space in Chicago and London during 2006. The Chicago lease, which began in August 2006, provides us with an opportunity to reorganize and maximize the utilization of our facilities in the downtown area. The London lease, which began in November 2006, allowed us to consolidate our existing London office with Swapstream’s facilities. The new leases resulted in additional rent expense of $1.1 million in 2006. Licensing and Other Fee Agreements. A large portion of the increase in this expense was attributable to an increase in licensing rates for S&P E-mini products and, to a lesser extent, NASDAQ E-mini products. Rate increases went into effect in June 2005 for NASDAQ products and September 2005 for S&P products in return for extending our exclusive rights to offer these products. Renegotiated licensing rates resulted in $6.5 million of incremental expense compared with 2005. Also, higher average daily trading volume for licensed products resulted in additional expense of $2.4 million in 2006. Higher volumes were attributable primarily to E-mini products based on the S&P 500 and NASDAQ-100. These increases in expense were partially offset by a $0.9 million decrease in fees paid to market maker program participants. The reduction in market maker fees was due primarily to the expiration of the Russell 1000 program in December 2005. Other Expense. In 2006, this expense increased primarily as a result of the preparation for and launch of a new global brand advertising campaign. The promotion of new products and production of CME’s quarterly magazine, which launched in the third quarter of 2005, also contributed to an increase in expense. Non-Operating Income and Expense (dollars in millions) 2006 2005 Change Investment income $ 55.8 $ 31.4 77 % Securities lending interest income 94.0 58.7 60 Securities lending interest expense (92.1 ) (56.8 ) 62 Interest expense (0.2 ) (0.3 ) (30 ) Equity in losses of unconsolidated subsidiaries (6.9 ) (2.6 ) 162 Total Non-Operating $ 50.6 $ 30.4 66 Investment Income. Rising market interest rates as well as increased funds available for investment resulted in increased investment income in 2006 when compared with 2005. Increases in investment income were partially offset by an increase in tax-advantaged investments, as a percentage of the total portfolio, during 2006. The annualized average rate of return and average investment balance 69 Table of Contents indicated in the table below include short-term investments classified as cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and clearing firms’ cash performance bonds and security deposits, but exclude the first IEFs and our non-qualified deferred compensation plan. Non-qualified deferred compensation plan earnings are excluded from this analysis as there is an equal and offsetting amount in compensation and benefits expense. (dollars in millions) 2006 2005 Change Annualized average rate of return 4.16 % 2.99 % 1.17 % Average investment balance $ 1,294.1 $ 951.6 $ 342.5 Increase in income due to balance $ 15.1 Increase in income due to rate 10.3 Increases due to rate and balance changes were partially offset by a decrease of $1.9 million resulting from the discontinuance of our investment in the first IEFs as of December 2005. Securities Lending Interest Income and Expense. The average daily balance of funds available for lending increased during 2006 relative to 2005. This was primarily the result of a policy change effective October 1, 2005 that increased the amount of securities available for lending to 70% from 50% of total eligible securities. (dollars in billions) 2006 2005 Change Average daily balance of funds invested $ 1.9 $ 1.8 $ 0.1 Annualized average rate earned 5.01 % 3.34 % 1.67 % Annualized average rate paid 4.91 3.23 1.68 Net earned from securities lending 0.10 0.11 (0.01 ) Equity in Losses of Unconsolidated Subsidiaries. This includes $6.1 million of losses from our investment in FXMS, which was formed in July 2006, as well as our proportionate share of losses from OneChicago. Income Tax Provision In 2006, the effective tax rate decreased from 39.6% to 39.4% when compared with 2005. The decrease is due primarily to increased investments in tax-advantaged securities, the impact of which was partially offset by the non-deductibility of net operating losses generated by our Swapstream operations subsequent to our acquisition of this business in August 2006. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash Requirements Historically, we have met our operational funding requirements with cash generated by operations. If operations do not provide sufficient funds to meet short-term and long-term capital expenditure requirements, cash and cash equivalents or marketable securities can be reduced to provide the needed funds, assets can be acquired through capital leases, or we can borrow using public or private debt facilities. In addition, we believe we can fund any pending or potential future acquisitions with internally available cash, debt financing or the issuance of equity securities. On February 26, 2008, we completed our transaction with Brazilian Mercantile & Futures Exchange S.A. (BM&F). We issued 1.2 million shares of Class A common stock (approximately a 2% equity interest in the company) in exchange for 101.1 million shares of BM&F (an equity interest of approximately 10%). Neither CME Group nor BM&F may sell its equity interest in the other until February 2012 under the provisions of the agreement. Our investment in BM&F is recorded at a cost of $631.4 million based on our stock price of $531.00 at close on February 25, 2008. Cash will also be required for operating leases and non-cancelable purchase obligations as well as commitments reflected as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2007. These commitments are as follows (in thousands): Year OperatingLeases PurchaseObligations OtherLiabilities Total (a) 2008 $ 17,731 $ 66,640 $ 21,651 $ 106,022 2009-2010 32,970 17,996 — 50,966 2011-2012 33,719 12,356 — 46,075 Thereafter 147,922 8,000 — 155,922 Total $ 232,342 $ 104,992 $ 21,651 $ 358,985 (a) Gross unrecognized tax liabilities of $9.7 million determined under FIN No. 48 are not included in the commitments table due to uncertainty about the date of their settlement. 70 Table of Contents Future capital expenditures for technology are anticipated as we continue to support our growth through investment in increased system capacity and performance and through technological initiatives on our electronic trading platforms. Each year capital expenditures are incurred for improvements to and expansion of our trading floor facilities, offices, remote data centers, telecommunications capabilities and other operating equipment. We expect 2008 capital expenditures to total between $225.0 million and $235.0 million, excluding leasehold improvements for our new office space that will be funded with landlord allowances. Anticipated capital expenditures for 2008 include approximately $77.0 million of data center build-out costs related primarily to our new data center. We intend to continue to pay a regular quarterly dividend to our shareholders. The decision to pay a dividend, however, remains within the discretion of our Board of Directors and may be affected by various factors, including our earnings, financial condition, capital requirements, level of indebtedness and other considerations our Board of Directors deems relevant. In 2007, our annual dividend target remained at approximately 30% of the prior year’s cash earnings. For 2008, our annual dividend target will remain at approximately 30% of 2007 cash earnings calculated as if the merger with CBOT Holdings had occurred on January 1, 2007. On January 30, 2008, the Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of $1.15 per share payable on March 25, 2008 to shareholders of record on March 10, 2008. Assuming no changes in the number of shares outstanding other than the issuance of 1.2 million shares to BM&F, the March 2008 dividend payment will total approximately $62.6 million. Sources and Uses of Cash Net cash provided by operating activities was $814.4 million in 2007 compared with $471.7 million in 2006. Net cash provided by operating activities increased due primarily to the increase in net income during 2007. In 2007, net cash provided by operating activities was $155.8 million higher than net income. Adjustments to net income consisted primarily of $105.7 million in depreciation and amortization, $33.9 million of amortization of purchased intangibles, and a $31.2 million increase in other current liabilities, partially offset by a $50.6 million increase in deferred income taxes and a $49.9 million increase in accounts receivable. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense is due primarily to additional assets obtained in our recent merger with CBOT Holdings. Accounts receivable in any period result primarily from the clearing and transaction fees billed in the last month of the reporting period. Cash used in investing activities was $78.6 million in 2007 compared with $85.9 million in 2006. The decrease in cash used compared with 2006 was due primarily to $116.0 million of cash acquired in our merger with CBOT Holdings and a $30.7 million increase in proceeds from maturities of marketable securities, net of purchases. These increases in cash were partially offset by a $75.8 million increase in property and equipment purchases, $39.8 million used to purchase exercise right privileges, and an increase of $37.2 million in merger-related transaction costs. Cash used in financing activities was $859.9 million in 2007 compared with $27.2 million for 2006. The increase in cash used was due primarily to $949.3 million paid to repurchase common stock and a $64.0 million increase in cash dividends to shareholders. This increase in cash used was partially offset by proceeds of debt issuances, net of maturities and debt issuance costs, of $162.9 million. Debt Instruments We maintain a 364-day revolving loan facility, with various financial institutions, which provides for loans of up to $750.0 million. This revolving loan facility serves as a back-up facility for our commercial paper program. Proceeds from the program were used to partially fund our recent tender offer stock repurchase and related fees. On September 5, 2007, we purchased 1.7 million shares of our Class A common stock at a purchase price of $560 per share for a total cost of approximately $950.6 million, including related fees and expenses. Under the terms of the facility, proceeds can also be used to finance the BM&F investment transaction and to pay general corporate purposes of up to $300.0 million. Our clearing house maintains an $800.0 million 364-day line of credit with a consortium of banks to be used in certain situations. The line of credit, which was renewed on October 12, 2007, continues to be collateralized by clearing firm security deposits held by us in the form of U.S. Treasury or agency securities, as well as security deposit funds in the Interest Earning Facilities and any performance bond deposits of a clearing firm that has defaulted on its obligation. The line of credit can only be drawn on to the extent it is collateralized. Security deposit collateral was $1.4 billion at December 31, 2007. 71 Table of Contents To satisfy our performance bond obligations with SGX, we pledge CME-owned U.S. Treasury securities in lieu of, or in combination with, irrevocable letters of credit. At December 31, 2007, the letters of credit totaled $113.0 million. In addition, we had pledged securities with a fair value of $100.1 million at December 31, 2007. CME also guarantees a $5.0 million standby letter of credit for GFX. The beneficiary of the letter of credit is the clearing firm that is used by GFX to execute and maintain its futures positions. The letter of credit will be utilized in the event GFX defaults in meeting performance bond requirements to its clearing firm. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As of December 31, 2007, we did not have any significant off-balance sheet arrangements as defined by the regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Liquidity and Cash Management Cash and cash equivalents totaled $845.3 million at December 31, 2007 compared with $969.5 million at December 31, 2006. The balance retained in cash and cash equivalents was a function of anticipated or possible short-term cash needs, prevailing interest rates, our investment policy, alternative investment choices and any dividends that we pay. Current net deferred tax assets of $18.4 million and $7.2 million are included in other current assets at December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006, respectively. Current net deferred tax assets result primarily from stock-based compensation and restructuring liabilities. At December 31, 2006, non-current net deferred tax assets were $30.9 million consisting primarily of depreciation and amortization, software development costs, stock-based compensation and deferred compensation. At December 31, 2007, non-current net deferred tax liabilities were $3.8 billion. Net deferred tax liabilities are primarily the result of purchase accounting for intangible assets in our merger with CBOT Holdings. Non-current net deferred tax liabilities also include an $11.2 million deferred tax asset for acquired and accumulated net operating losses related to Swapstream. Since Swapstream has not yet developed a pattern of operating income, our assessment at December 31, 2007 is that we do not believe that we currently meet the more-likely-than-not threshold that would allow us to realize the value of acquired and accumulated foreign net operating losses in the future. As a result, the deferred tax benefit arising from these net operating losses has been fully reserved. Each clearing firm is required to deposit and maintain a specified performance bond balance, which is determined by parameters established by the risk management department of the clearing house and may fluctuate over time. Performance bond requirements can be satisfied with a variety of approved investments and cash. Cash performance bonds and security deposits are included in our consolidated balance sheets. With the exception of the portion of securities deposited that are utilized in our securities lending program, clearing firm deposits, other than those retained in the form of cash, are not included in our consolidated balance sheets. Securities lending transactions utilize a portion of the securities that clearing firms have deposited to satisfy their proprietary performance bond requirements. Securities lending activity fluctuates based on the amount of securities that clearing firms have deposited and the demand for securities lending activity in the particular securities available to us. As a result of these factors, the balances in cash performance bonds and security deposits, as well as the balances in our securities lending program, may fluctuate significantly over time. Cash performance bonds and security deposits and collateral from securities lending consisted of the following at December 31: (in millions) 2007 2006 Cash performance bonds $ 799.1 $ 506.0 Cash security deposits 18.6 15.1 Cross-margin arrangements — 0.1 Performance collateral for delivery 15.3 — Total Cash Performance Bonds and Security Deposits 833.0 521.2 Collateral from securities lending activities and payable under securities lending agreements 2,862.0 2,130.2 Total $ 3,695.0 $ 2,651.4 We are required under the Commodity Exchange Act to segregate cash and securities deposited by clearing firms on behalf of customers. In addition, our exchange rules require a segregation of all funds and securities deposited by clearing firms from exchange 72 Table of Contents operating funds and marketable securities. As with cash performance bonds and security deposits, these balances will fluctuate due to the investment choices available to clearing firms and the change in total deposits required. Securities, at fair value, and IEF funds were deposited for the following purposes at December 31: (in millions) 2007 2006 Performance bonds $ 57,165.5 $ 47,270.6 Security deposits 1,440.0 1,250.5 Cross-margin arrangements 486.2 273.7 Performance collateral for delivery 49.9 — Total $ 59,141.6 $ 48,794.8 Cash Earnings Cash earnings, a non-GAAP measure, is the primary metric used by us to measure our financial performance. It is the basis for calculating dividends to shareholders. It is calculated as net income plus depreciation and amortization expense (excluding amortization of landlord-funded amounts), plus tax-effected stock-based compensation, plus tax-effected amortization of purchased intangibles, less capital expenditures excluding landlord-funded amounts. For 2008, our annual dividend target will be based on 2007 cash earnings calculated as if the merger with CBOT Holdings had occurred on January 1, 2007. The cash earnings amount is calculated as follows: (in millions) 2007 2006 Net income $ 658.5 $ 407.3 Depreciation and amortization 104.4 72.8 Stock-based compensation, net of tax 13.7 10.0 Amortization of purchased intangibles, net of tax 20.4 — Capital expenditures (153.2 ) (87.3 ) Cash Earnings $ 643.8 $ 402.8 CBOT Holdings cash earnings (a) 192.5 — Pro forma Cash Earnings $ 836.3 $ 402.8 (a) CBOT Holdings cash earnings reflect CBOT Holdings’ consolidated net income for the period January 1 through July 12, 2007, plus depreciation and amortization expense, plus tax-effected stock-based compensation, less capital expenditures. All adjustments to net income were calculated for the period January 1 through July 12, 2007. The cash earnings calculation, with some modifications, is also used as the basis for determining annual incentive payments to employees. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are subject to various market risks, including those caused by changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. Interest Rate Risk. Our investment policy is to preserve principal and liquidity while maximizing return through the investment of available funds. Investments typically include money market mutual funds, municipal securities, and U.S. Treasury and government agency securities with fixed or variable rate terms. Under our investment policy, we monitor interest rate risk by completing regular reviews of our marketable securities portfolio and its sensitivity to changes in the general level of interest rates, commonly referred to as a portfolio’s duration. We control the duration of the portfolio primarily through the purchase of individual marketable securities having duration consistent with our overall investment policy. In addition, we will generally hold marketable securities to maturity, which will act as a further mitigating factor to interest rate risk. Under our investment policy, the aggregate portfolio duration cannot exceed 24 months. A change in market interest rates would affect interest income as well as the fair value of investments. All of our investments are carried at fair value. For purposes of this analysis, marketable securities exclude the investments of our non-qualified deferred compensation plan. Interest income from short-term cash investments, marketable securities, and cash performance bonds and security deposits was $69.8 million and $53.8 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively. Our marketable securities portfolio experienced a net unrealized gain of $3.1 million in 2007 and a net unrealized gain of $2.1 million in 2006. There were no material realized gains or losses from sales of marketable securities in either period. 73 Table of Contents Expected maturities and interest coupon rates for marketable securities, all of which were fixed-rate securities, were as follows at December 31, 2007 (dollars in thousands): Year PrincipalCash Flows WeightedAverageInterestRate 2008 $ 180,410 3.08 % Fair Value 180,242 The 2008 expected maturities include $26.7 million in principal amount of zero coupon marketable securities. Excluding zero coupon securities, the 2008 weighted average interest rate would be 3.61%. We maintain a 364-day revolving loan facility of up to $750.0 million with various financial institutions. This loan facility serves as a back-up facility for our commercial paper program. As of December 31, 2007, we have not utilized this facility. During 2007, commercial paper notes with an aggregate par value of $1.2 billion and maturities ranging from one to 97 days were issued. We believe the short-term nature of these borrowings and the availability of funds from operations mitigates our interest rate risk exposure. Foreign Exchange Risk. GFX engages primarily in the purchase and sale of our foreign exchange futures contracts on the CME Globex platform to provide additional liquidity in these products. GFX subsequently enters into offsetting transactions using futures contracts or spot foreign exchange transactions with approved counterparties in the interbank market to limit its market risk. Any potential impact on the GFX earnings from a change in foreign exchange rates would not be significant. Net intraday position limits, which are established for each trader, totaled $12.0 million in aggregate notional value as of December 31, 2007. At December 31, 2007, GFX held futures positions with a notional value of $131.7 million, offset by a similar amount of spot foreign exchange positions. The notional value of futures positions at December 31, 2006 totaled $111.8 million. All positions are marked to market on a daily basis using our foreign exchange settlement prices, with resulting gain or loss reflected in other revenues. Net trading gains were $9.2 million and $7.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The third-party contract relating to our e-CBOT electronic trading platform obligates us to make payments denominated in pounds sterling. As a result, we are exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates. We engage in foreign currency hedging activities in order to reduce our risk from movements in foreign currency exchange rates where practicable to do so. However, where we are not able to enter into foreign currency hedging transactions on terms satisfactory to us, we retain risk associated with movements in foreign currency exchange rates. The primary purpose of our foreign currency hedging activities is to manage the volatility associated with foreign currency purchases of materials and services and liabilities created in the normal course of our business. We do not rely on economic hedges to manage risk. We currently utilize foreign currency forward contracts that we have identified as fair value hedges. These are intended to offset the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on firm commitments for purchases of fixed annual and quarterly services denominated in pounds sterling. Forward contracts designated as hedges had a notional amount of approximating $13.3 million (£6.7 million) at December 31, 2007. Certain forward contracts previously designated as hedges have been undesignated as a result of negotiations with vendors which reduced the firm commitments previously hedged. Forward contracts which were undesignated had a notional value of approximately $6.0 million (£3.0 million) at December 31, 2007. The fair value of hedging contracts and non-hedging contracts was $1.8 million and $0.8 million, respectively, at December 31, 2007. Losses related to contracts that no longer qualify for hedge accounting totaled $0.1 million in 2007. 74 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 20:16:36.008615
1156375,CME,CME GROUP INC.,2009,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” page 56, for the average daily volume of contracts traded in our four principal product lines for the last three years. Although dislocations in credit and lending markets have significantly impacted our interest rate complex, our other product lines, especially equity indexes, showed solid volume growth in 2008. Looking forward, we will continue to focus on expense discipline while providing customers with the best ways to manage risk at a time of economic uncertainty. Interest Rate Products. Our interest rate products enable banks and other financial institutions worldwide to hedge interest rate risks, and in turn help to reduce the overall cost of borrowing and financing. Our interest rate products allow our customers to execute transactions across the entire U.S. dollar-denominated yield curve using some of the world’s most actively traded futures and options products. Customers may manage short-, medium- and long-term interest rate risk using our products based on Eurodollars, U.S. Treasuries, swaps and other dollar-related instruments. As a result of our acquisition of CBOT, our interest rate products include CBOT’s thirty-year U.S. Treasury bond futures and options on futures; ten-year, five-year and two-year U.S. Treasury note futures and options; and interest rate swap futures and options and federal funds futures and options. Fifty-two percent of our overall annual trading volume in 2008 and 38% of our clearing and transaction fees was based upon our interest rate products. The overall volume of our interest rate product line was down compared with 2007. The decrease was as a result of decreased trading in our Eurodollar options contract due to increased volatility in the relationship between the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) and the overnight federal funds effective rate, declining correlations between risk free Treasury rates and spread products, a slowdown in corporate debt and mortgage originations, industry consolidation, declining assets under management, a severe decrease in mortgage-related structured product transactions and pressure resulting from failures in the repo market. In 2009, we believe that our interest rate product line will continue to be negatively impacted by the current state of the economy and a zero interest rate policy. We believe that this decline could be partially offset by the increased Treasury issuances and the need to manage the associated interest rate risks as well as transitions to exchange traded and cleared products by over-the-counter participants in response to heightened concerns about counterparty risk and the need for greater balance sheet efficiencies. Equity Products. Our equity products permit investors to obtain exposure, for hedging or speculative purposes, to changes in the weighting of one or more equity market sectors more efficiently than by buying or selling the underlying securities. By allowing investors to effectively manage stock market risks, our equity products increase investor confidence and overall participation in these important markets. We are a leading equity index marketplace, offering futures and options products (including our E-mini contracts) on key benchmark equity indexes covering small-, medium- and large-cap companies in the U.S., Europe and Asia. These include the Standard & Poor’s, Dow Jones, NASDAQ, Nikkei, MSCI and FTSE/Xinhua indexes, and others. We have exclusive licensing arrangements with Standard & Poor’s Corporation (S&P), NASDAQ OMX Group, Inc. (NASDAQ OMX) and Dow Jones & Company, Inc. (Dow Jones), which allow us to offer futures and options on futures on their indexes, including our contracts based on the S&P 500 Index, the NASDAQ-100 Index and the Dow Jones Industrial Average. For a detailed description of these licensing arrangements, see the section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K entitled “Item 1. Business—Licensing Agreements.” 9 Table of Contents Trading in these products represented 31% of our total trading volume and 32% of our clearing and transaction fees during 2008. We believe our leading market position in equity products is a result of the liquidity of our markets, the status of the S&P 500, the NASDAQ-100 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average indexes as the principal U.S. financial standards for benchmarking stock market returns, and the appeal to investors and traders of our E-mini products and other equity products and our CME Globex platform. These investors include public and private pension funds, investment companies, mutual funds, insurance companies and other financial services companies that benchmark their investment performance to different segments of the equity markets. We believe future growth in our equity products will come from increased counterparty credit concerns, continued education of our customers as to the benefits of our equity product portfolio to serve their risk management needs and the benefits of futures products over cash equities. We believe that our equity volumes may also be impacted by the trading volume levels of the underlying markets as well as their level of volatility. Foreign Exchange Products. We became the first exchange to introduce financial futures when we launched foreign exchange futures in 1972. Our foreign exchange market serves as an effective and efficient means of risk transfer for the global foreign exchange market, bringing together a broad array of client segments by offering investment as well as risk management opportunities. Our customers benefit from dealing anonymously in a fully transparent market, where large and small customers have equal access to the same prices and deep pool of liquidity. Our foreign exchange products provide the tools and resources to hedge foreign exchange risk, facilitating cross-border trade and commerce while mitigating the risks to profitability due to fluctuations in the foreign exchange market. Our foreign exchange market attracts both buy- and sell-side investors, including commercial and investment banks, hedge funds, commodity trading advisors, proprietary trading firms and individual investors. Approximately 95% of our foreign exchange products are traded electronically on the CME Globex platform, ensuring that business is transacted quickly with maximum operational efficiency. Today, we offer approximately 40 foreign exchange futures and approximately 30 foreign exchange options on futures products, covering major as well as a broad array of emerging market currency pairs in more than 20 different currencies. In 2008, we saw an average daily volume of 623,000 foreign exchange contracts per day, with a notional value of $84.5 billion a day. Trading in our foreign exchange products represented 5% of our total trading volume in 2008 and 7% of our clearing and transaction fees. We believe future growth in our foreign exchange product line will come from expanding and diversifying our product suite and customer base. For example, trading in volatility-based options on six of our foreign exchange options began in March 2008. We are expanding our foreign exchange options product suite to appeal to a broader array of customer segments, and we expect continued strong growth in the electronic execution of foreign exchange options on CME Globex in 2009. As we expand our global footprint in the foreign exchange market, we expect increased trading volume from customers outside of the United States. We also expect an increased demand in the over-the-counter market for cleared products, which we are targeting. Firms, however, have reduced their foreign exchange trading volume in light of the current economic conditions and consolidation within the industry. Commodity and Alternative Investment Products. Our commodity products help establish benchmark prices and play an important role in risk management. These products provide hedging tools for our customers who deal in tangible physical commodities, including agricultural producers of commodities, food processors and consumers of energy. Commodity products were our only products when our exchange first opened for business. We have maintained a strong franchise in our commodity products, including futures contracts based on cattle, hogs, pork bellies, lumber, dairy products, soybeans, corn, wheat, oats and rough rice. Following our acquisition of NYMEX, we also offer contracts based on crude oil, natural gas, heating oil, gasoline, copper and aluminum as well as other soft commodities. Our energy products offer a way for producers, marketers and refiners to manage fuel price risk in a volatile, growing market faced with mounting regulatory and market pressures. In September 2008, we sold the CBOT metals trading complex to NYSE Euronext. We also provide our customers with non-traditional, alternative investment products to diversify and manage their risk. Our real estate products provide opportunities for risk protection, and extend to the real estate industry the same financial tools that our previous innovations have brought to agriculture and finance. By providing a means of hedging exposure to real estate prices, customers can diffuse the potential impact of sustained declines in real estate prices. We also are the only regulated exchange that offers risk management products on the weather market through our weather contracts based on aggregate temperatures in more than 40 cities around the world as well as hurricane, snowfall and frost indexes. Commodity and alternative investment products accounted for 12% of our trading volume and 23% of our clearing and transaction fees during 2008. 10 Table of Contents We continue to execute our strategy of growing our customer base and providing side-by-side access to our commodity markets. We believe the changing perception of commodities as an asset class provides an opportunity for growth in our markets. We also anticipate growth in our energy products as a result of price volatility, increased use of CME ClearPort due to credit concerns and continued enhancements to our product portfolio. However, we believe that increases in volume may be offset by the negative impact of the current economic situation. Market Data and Information Products. Our markets generate valuable information regarding prices and trading activity in our products that we believe enhances the appeal of our products. The dissemination of real-time data generates revenues and supports our customer base with timely market information. We sell our market data, which includes information about bids, offers, trades and trade size in our products, to banks, broker-dealers, pension funds, investment companies, mutual funds, insurance companies, individual investors and other financial services companies or organizations that use our markets or monitor general economic conditions. We distribute our market data directly to our electronic trading customers as part of their access to our markets through our electronic facilities. We also distribute market data via dedicated networks to quote vendors who consolidate our market data with that from other exchanges, other third party data providers and news services, and then resell their consolidated data. Revenues from market data products totaled $279.5 million, or 11% of our total revenues, in 2008. Sophisticated quantitative approaches to risk management as well as customer time sensitivity have created new needs, uses and demands for trading-related data and analytics. This timely information has become even more important in light of the volatility and uncertainty in today’s markets. We continue to enhance our current market data and information product offerings by creating new value-added services to complement our market data products, including databases, analytical tools and other services to assist end-users. In 2008, we launched the latest version of E-quotes, a real-time streaming market data application that offers quotes, charting, advanced analytics and news on CME Group traded products. E-quotes will enable users to access prices for all CME Group listings. Additionally, to expand our market data product offerings, in 2008 we purchased CMA. CMA provides credit market pricing data and intra-day services to increase productivity, efficiency and speed of transactions in the over-the-counter markets. As part of our market data and information products business, we also supply services to S&P and OneChicago, our joint venture with the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc. (CBOE) and Interactive Brokers Group, in connection with the usage reporting, contract administration and associated billing and revenue collection for the display and integration of their market data into our standard market data distribution. We are the exclusive distributor of Dow Jones Index data from our market data distribution platform. We also provide access to all prices for products listed on the Minneapolis Grain Exchange and the Kansas City Board of Trade, which are available for electronic trading on CME Globex. We believe that there has been a decline in subscriptions of market data due primarily to the consolidation of many of our customers and related headcount reductions as a result of the current financial crisis. For example, the number of subscriptions for devices for CME and CBOT market data combined decreased from 293,000 at December 31, 2007 to 290,000 December 31, 2008. To the extent that our customers continue to consolidate, we could experience further declines in our market data revenues derived from such subscriptions. Execution Our primary trade execution facilities consist of our CME Globex electronic trading platform and our open outcry trading floors in Chicago and New York City. These execution facilities offer our customers immediate trade execution and price transparency and are supported by substantial infrastructure and technology for order routing, trade reporting, market data dissemination and market surveillance and regulation. In addition, trades can be executed through privately negotiated transactions that are cleared and settled through our clearing house. Electronic Trading. Our CME Globex electronic trading platform maintains an electronic, centralized order book and trade execution algorithm for futures contracts and options on futures contracts and allows users to enter orders directly into the order book. In January 2008, we completed the migration of CBOT’s products to the CME Globex platform. Pursuant to a previously existing transaction-processing services agreement, we began listing NYMEX’s products on our platform in 2006. In 2008, 79% of our average daily trading volume was executed electronically, compared with 78% in 2007. During 2008, approximately 76% of our clearing and transaction fees revenue was derived from electronic trading. Open Outcry Trading. We also offer our members the ability to execute transactions in an open-auction format on our trading floors—a centralized meeting place for traders and floor brokers to trade our products. Orders by market participants not physically located on the trading floor are communicated to floor brokers. Current market information and news are displayed on wallboards hung above the trading pits. In the second quarter of 2008, we integrated the CME and CBOT trading floors at one location at 141 West Jackson Boulevard in Chicago. As a result of our acquisition of NYMEX, we now operate open outcry trading in New York City at One North End Avenue. We plan to integrate the NYMEX and COMEX trading floors into one floor in the second quarter of 2009. Open outcry trading represented 15% of our average daily trading volume in 2008 and accounted for approximately 14% of our clearing and transaction fees revenue. 11 Table of Contents Privately Negotiated and Over- the-Counter Transactions. In addition to offering traditional open outcry and electronic trading through the CME Globex platform, we permit qualified customers to trade our products by entering into privately negotiated transactions, which are reported and included in the market data we distribute. We also clear, settle and guarantee these transactions through our clearing house and CME Clearport. These off exchange transactions, provide our customers with the flexibility to negotiate their own prices and still take advantage of our financial safeguards. During 2008, approximately 10% of our clearing and transaction fees revenue was derived from this type of trading. Clearing We operate our own clearing house—CME Clearing—that clears, settles and guarantees the performance of all transactions matched through our execution facilities and on third party exchanges for which we provide clearing services. Our integrated clearing function is designed to ensure the safety and soundness of our markets. Ownership and control of our own clearing house also enables us to retain the revenue associated with both the trading and clearing of our products. By owning our clearing house, we control the cost structure and the technology development cycle for our clearing services. It helps us manage our new product initiatives without being dependent on an outside entity. It also benefits our customers by creating operational, risk management and product benefits. Additionally, owning our own clearing house allows us to generate additional revenue by providing clearing services to other exchanges. Up until the closing of the merger with CBOT Holdings, we provided clearing services to CBOT. In 2008, our clearing house cleared an average of 11.0 million contracts daily and 3.0 billion contracts overall. As of December 31, 2008, we acted as custodian for approximately $116.1 billion in performance bond, security deposit and other collateral deposited by our clearing firms and, during 2008, we transferred an average of approximately $4.4 billion a day in settlement funds through our clearing system. We are recognized by the United Kingdom’s Financial Services Authority as a Recognised Overseas Clearing House, which enables us to provide global clearing services to market participants in the United Kingdom and serve a wider range of those customers’ risk management needs. In addition, our clearing house guarantees the performance of all our contracts with a financial safeguards package of approximately $6.6 billion (as of December 31, 2008). The clearing function provides three primary benefits to our markets: a reliable credit guarantee; efficient, high-volume transaction processing; and cost and capital efficiencies. The services we provide can be broadly categorized as follows: • market protection and risk management; • transaction processing and position management; • settlement, collateral and delivery services; • cross-margining and mutual offset services; and • investment services. Market Protection and Risk Management. Our clearing house guarantee of performance is a significant attraction, and an important part of the functioning of our exchange. Central counterparty guarantee. Because of this guarantee, our customers do not need to evaluate the credit of each potential counterparty or limit themselves to a selected set of counterparties. The benefits of centralized clearing have been made even more apparent during the recent financial uncertainty. Although not a guarantee of future performance, in our more than 100 year history of trading, we have never had a default or a loss of customer funds resulting from the failure of a clearing firm. Performance bond requirements. Performance bonds are deposits required from our clearing firms to ensure that they can cover potential losses in connection with their trading positions. Performance bonds are calculated by our Standard Portfolio Analysis of Risk (SPAN) system that is used by about 50 exchanges and clearing organizations around the world. SPAN evaluates overall portfolio risk by calculating the worst possible loss that a portfolio of derivative and physical instruments might reasonably incur over a specified time period (typically one trading day). This is done by computing the gains and losses that the portfolio would incur under different market conditions. Additionally, the substitution of our clearing house as the counterparty to every transaction allows our customers to establish a position with one party and then to offset the position with another party. This contract offsetting process provides our customers with flexibility in establishing and adjusting positions and provides for performance bond efficiencies. Twice daily mark-to-market process. At each settlement cycle, our clearing house values, at the market price prevailing at that time, or marks-to-market, all open positions and requires payments from clearing firms whose positions have lost value and makes payments to clearing firms whose positions have gained value. Our clearing house marks-to-market all open positions at least twice a day, and more often if market volatility warrants. Marking-to-market provides both participants in a transaction with an accounting of their financial obligations under the contract. Having a mark-to-market cycle of a minimum of two times a day helps 12 Table of Contents protect the financial integrity of our clearing house, our clearing firms and market participants. This allows our clearing house to identify quickly any clearing firms that may not be able to satisfy the financial obligations resulting from changes in the prices of their open contracts before those financial obligations become exceptionally large and jeopardize the ability of our clearing house to ensure performance of their open positions. This transparency makes it difficult for traders to hide losses or disguise unusual profits. Segregation of customer funds. Regulations require our clearing firms to separately account for and segregate customers’ positions and monies from their own (requirements that also extend to CME Clearing). If a clearing firm becomes financially unstable or insolvent due to a financial issue, a customer’s funds held in such a segregated account (provided they are not involved in the financial issue itself) will not be subject to the clearing firm’s creditor claims. In situations where a clearing firm were to become insolvent, the customer accounts could be transferred to another clearing firm. Twenty-four hour monitoring by risk management team. In order to ensure performance, we establish and monitor financial requirements of our clearing firms. We employ approximately 100 employees who use a variety of sophisticated tools to observe risk in our markets 24 hours a day, six days a week. These employees work closely with other teams across the organization in products and services, legal and market regulation as well as with our clearing firms to help our customers manage risk during periods of economic uncertainty. Multi-billion dollar safeguards package. CME Clearing’s approximately $6.6 billion financial safeguard system (as of December 31, 2008) is designed for the benefit and protection of both clearing members and their customers and is described in more detail on page 71 of “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” Credit default swaps margining regime. In connection with our decision to enter the market for clearing credit default swaps, we modified our framework to address the unique characteristics of this product. In addition to our traditional risk management procedures described above, we will be using a multi-factor model for margining designed to address the unique risk factors relating to these products. Transaction Processing and Position Management. Our CLEARING 21 system, developed with NYMEX in the early 1990s, processes reported trades and positions on a real-time basis, providing users with instantaneous information on trades, positions and risk exposure. CLEARING 21 is able to process trades in futures and options products, securities and cash instruments. CLEARING 21 can also support complex new product types, including combinations, options on combinations, options on options, swaps, repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements, and other instruments. Through CLEARING 21 user interfaces, our clearing firms can electronically manage their positions, exercise options, enter transactions related to foreign exchange deliveries, manage collateral posted to meet performance bond requirements and access all of our other online applications. Together with our order routing and trade matching services, we offer straight-through electronic processing of transactions in which an order is electronically routed, matched, cleared and made available to the clearing firm’s back-office systems for further processing. Settlement, Collateral and Delivery Services. We manage final settlement in all of our contracts, including cash settlement, physical delivery of selected commodities, and option exercises and assignments. Because some initial and maintenance performance bonds from clearing firms, as well as mark-to-market obligations on some of our contracts, are denominated in various foreign currencies, we offer multi-currency performance bond and settlement services. Generally, although most of our futures contracts are liquidated before the expiration of the contract, the underlying financial instruments or commodities for the remainder of the contracts must be delivered. We act as the delivery agent for all contracts, ensuring timely delivery by the seller of the exact quality and quantity specified in a contract and full and timely payment by the buyer. To administer its system of financial safeguards efficiently, our clearing house has developed banking relationships with a network of major U.S. banks and banking industry infrastructure providers, such as the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications. Among the key services provided to our clearing house by these banks and service providers are a variety of custody, credit and payment services that support the substantial financial commitments and processes backing the guarantee of our clearing house to market participants. Cross-Margining and Mutual Offset Services. Cross-margining arrangements reduce capital costs for clearing firms and customers. These agreements permit an individual clearing house to recognize a clearing firm’s open positions at other participating clearing houses, and clearing firms are able to offset risks of positions held at one clearing house against those held at other participating clearing houses. This arrangement reduces the need for collateral deposits by the clearing firm. For example, our cross-margining program with the Options Clearing Corporation reduced performance bond requirements for our members by an average of approximately $1.5 billion per day utilized in 2008. We have implemented cross-margining arrangements with the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation and LCH.Clearnet Group for positions at the London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange Limited that are cleared through LCH.Clearnet Group. In addition, our mutual offset agreement with the Singapore Exchange allows a clearing firm of either exchange initiating trades in certain products on either exchange to execute after-hours trades at the other exchange in those products and then transfer them back to the originating exchange. This mutual offset arrangement enables firms to execute trades at either exchange virtually 24 hours per day. This arrangement has been in place since 1984 and was renewed in October 2006 for an additional three-year term with automatic renewals for one year each unless terminated by either party. 13 Table of Contents Investment Services. In order to achieve collateral efficiencies for our clearing firms, we have established a number of collateral programs under the designation Interest Earning Facility (IEF). Under this program, our clearing firms may select from four different IEF programs to meet their individual needs. The programs are designed to enable our clearing firms to make optimal use of the demand deposit cash accounts and security accounts they have established to satisfy our performance bond requirements. We earn fee income in return for providing these value-added services to our clearing firms. Our clearing house launched a securities lending program in 2001 using a portion of certain securities deposited to meet the proprietary performance bond requirements of our clearing firms. Under this securities lending program, we lend a security to a third party and receive collateral in the form of cash. The majority of the cash is then invested to generate interest income. The related interest expense represents payment to the borrower of the security for the cash collateral retained during the duration of the lending transaction. Securities on loan are marked-to-market daily and compared to collateral received. The CME program is currently suspended due to high volatility in the credit markets. Technology Our operation of both electronic and open outcry trading facilities and a clearing house has influenced the design and implementation of the technologies that support our operations. Trading Technology. We have a proven track record of operating successful electronic and open outcry markets by developing and integrating multiple, evolving technologies that support a growing and substantial trading volume. The integrated suite of technologies we employ to accomplish this has been designed to support a significant expansion of our current business and provides us with an opportunity to leverage our technology base into new markets, products and services. As electronic trading activity expands, we continue to provide greater match engine functionality unique to various markets, market models and product types. We have adopted a modular approach to technology development and engineered an integrated set of solutions that support multiple specialized markets. We continually monitor and upgrade our capacity requirements. Our goal is to design our systems to handle at least one and a half times our historical peak transactions in our highest volume products. Significant investments in production planning, quality assurance and certification processes have enhanced our ability to expedite the delivery of the system enhancements that we develop for our customers. In January 2008, we completed the migration of CBOT products onto the CME Globex platform. We continue to implement technology upgrades that provide speed and functionality enhancements for our customers. In the fourth quarter of 2008, we completed server upgrades for our interest rate match engines to allow for sizeable speed improvements and the launch of implied, intercommodity spreads for Treasury futures and swap futures. Speed, reliability, scalability, capacity and functionality are critical performance criteria for electronic trading platforms. A substantial portion of our operating budget is dedicated to system design, development and operations in order to achieve high levels of overall system performance. In 2008, we continued our efforts to grow and enhance our electronic trading capabilities. For example, we enhanced our CME Globex credit controls to provide pre-execution risk controls that enable our customers to set defined trading limits and select real-time notifications if those limits are exceeded, including e-mail notification, order blocking and order cancellation. We also maintain remote data facilities to provide additional system capacity and redundancy for our trading and clearing technology. Our data centers support our customer interfaces, trading and execution systems, as well as clearing and settlement operations. The technology systems supporting our trading operations can be divided into five major categories: Distribution Technologies that support the ability of customers to access our trading systems from terminals through network access to our trading floor and/or electronic trading environments. Order routing/order management Technologies that control the flow of orders to the trading floor or electronic trading systems and that monitor the status of and modify submitted orders. Trade matching (electronic market) Technologies that aggregate submitted orders and electronically match buy and sell orders when their trade conditions are met. Market data Technologies that distribute order information to our end user customers on our market data platform. Trading floor operations Technologies that maximize market participants’ ability to capitalize on opportunities present in both the trading floor and electronic markets that we operate. 14 Table of Contents The CME Globex electronic trading platform includes the distribution, order routing, order management, trade matching and market data technology. CME Globex’s modularity and functionality enable us to selectively add products with unique trading characteristics onto the trading platform. The distribution technologies we offer differentiate our platform and bring liquidity and trading volume to our execution facilities. As of December 31, 2008, we had approximately 980 direct connections with our systems for customers across the globe. Many of these customers connect through a dedicated private network that is readily available, has wide distribution and provides fast connections in the Americas, Europe and Asia. We have telecommunications hubs in Amsterdam, Dublin, London, Milan, Paris, Sao Paulo and Singapore to respond to customer requests and reduce the cost of trading for our foreign customers. We plan to add hubs in Seoul and Shanghai. In order routing and management, we offer a range of mechanisms and were among the first U.S. derivatives exchanges to implement the FIX protocol—the standard order routing protocol used within the securities industry. In addition, our order routing and order management systems are capable of supporting multiple electronic trading match engines. This functionality gives us great latitude in the types of markets that we choose to serve. Several key technology platforms and standards are used to support these activities, including fault-tolerant Hewlett Packard Integrity NonStop servers that incorporate Intel Itanium processors, IBM mainframes, Microsoft software, Hitachi and EMC Storage Area Network (SAN equipment), Sun Microsystems and Hewlett Packard servers, Oracle and DB2 databases, LINUX, UNIX, Novell, TIBCO middleware and multi-vendor network solutions. Our futures match engine design was based upon a computerized trading and match software known as the NSC system. We are in the early stages of enhancing our options engine to support the migration of our futures products from the NSC system to our internally designed options platform. Our options match engine was designed and built at CME with focus on the speed of matching buy and sell orders and fault tolerance for 24-hour trading. This transition to a single match engine will bring better system performance and more opportunity for combination futures/options trading, while allowing us to more easily and cost-effectively scale our system for future growth. All existing functionality will be present and we expect that the migration will be relatively seamless to the end customer. In February 2009, we migrated our FX currency futures to the options platform and plan to move our other product lines to the system in the future. We continue to work on enhancements to our match engine to build a fully-functional electronic marketplace for unique trading demands where our customers can offset their risk with as much ease as in our open outcry trading facilities. Over the last three years we have made significant investments in market data technologies to support increased trading and messaging volumes. Enhancements include performance improvements, scalability with a new multicast distribution platform, and a FIX 5.0 compliant messaging format. These implementations benefit our customers through reducing required bandwidth and costs as well improving performance. Clearing Technology. CLEARING 21, our clearing and settlement software, SPAN, our margining and risk management software and CME ClearPort, form the core of our clearing technology. CLEARING 21 is a system for high-volume, high-capacity clearing and settlement of exchange-based transactions that we developed jointly with NYMEX in the early 1990s. The system offers clearing firms improved efficiency and reduced costs. CLEARING 21’s modular design gives us the ability to rapidly introduce new products. The software can be customized to meet the unique needs of specialized markets. Our SPAN system is a highly sophisticated methodology that calculates performance bond requirements by analyzing the “what-ifs” of virtually any market scenario. Developed and implemented in 1988 by CME, SPAN was the first system ever to calculate performance bond requirements exclusively on the basis of overall portfolio risk at both the clearing firm and customer level. In the years since its inception, SPAN has become the industry standard for portfolio risk assessment. It is the official performance bond (margin) mechanism of 50 registered exchanges, clearing organization, service bureaus and regulatory agencies throughout the world. CME ClearPort is our flexible, internet-based system we acquired through our acquisition of NYMEX that provides clearing services of over-the-counter transactions. The system lets market participants take advantage of the financial depth and security of our clearing house. Through this technology, customers can conduct their own transactions off-exchange, negotiate their own prices, and still take advantage of our central counterparty clearing. Building Services Following our mergers with CBOT Holdings and NYMEX Holdings, we now own and manage real estate, with approximately 1.5 million square feet of commercial space in the central business district of Chicago and approximately 500,000 square feet in downtown New York City. As of December 31, 2008, our real estate was approximately 95% occupied, with nearly 40% of the total space used by us. In 2008, we completed the renovations of the CBOT trading floor and migrated the CME trading floors from 20 South Wacker Drive to 141 West Jackson Boulevard in Chicago. We expect to consolidate the NYMEX and the COMEX trading floors located at One North End Avenue in New York City in the second quarter of 2009. 15 Table of Contents Tenants pay market rates for rent. The majority of tenant leases have terms of three to five years, with large tenants generally having leases for up to fifteen years. As of December 31, 2008, the largest tenant in Chicago, other than us, leased approximately 8% of the total area and the next five largest tenants leased about 14% of the total area. In New York City, the largest tenant leased approximately 12% of the total area. We manage both the real estate and the general services relating to our real estate such as cleaning, power and telephone services. Building services generated about 1% of our total revenues in 2008. Business Continuity Planning We continue to strengthen and upgrade our disaster recovery facilities and capabilities. We have dedicated significant resources to improve our continuity planning. For example, our disaster recovery infrastructure and activities include: • Formal disaster recovery testing conducted twice a year at each of our data centers. • Network disaster recovery testing conducted monthly. • Participation in an annual industry-wide disaster recovery test sponsored by the Futures Industry Association. • Bi-annual table top exercises utilizing remote access to our systems with employees responsible for our critical business unit procedures. Additionally, in order to ensure proper coordination during a potential crisis, we have established relationships with the local business community, law enforcement, and local and regional governmental emergency agencies. Strategic Relationships We continually review our growth strategy and whether it is in the interests of our shareholders to engage in discussions with other parties regarding various strategic acquisitions, partnerships, divestitures and other arrangements and alliances. The following is a summary of our key strategic relationships: BM&F. To increase liquidity and expand the international market for our customers, we have established a partnership with BM&F, the leading exchange in Latin America. Pursuant to an order routing agreement, BM&F products can be traded by participants connected to the CME Globex electronic trading platform, and CME Group products can be traded by participants connected to the BM&F’s Global Trading System electronic trading platform. We own an equity stake of approximately 5% in BM&F and BM&F owns an equity stake of approximately 1.7% in CME Group. Confirm Hub. ConfirmHub, LLC is a joint venture founded in 2004 by the leaders in the energy brokerage and exchange industry. The current membership consists of the GFI Group, Amerex, ICAP, Tullett Prebon and NYMEX. ConfirmHub allows users to manage confirmation processing of brokered, exchange-traded, and bilateral transactions through a single web services application programming interface and an interactive, web-based trade confirmation application. Dubai Mercantile Exchange. In February 2009, DME futures contracts became exclusively traded electronically on the CME Globex platform. The listing of the DME Oman crude oil futures contract and the DME Oman crude oil financial contract on CME Globex will further increase opportunities for improved risk management by Asian refiners through sophisticated hedging strategies, as well as arbitrage opportunities and other advanced trading strategies. Green Exchange. In 2008, NYMEX announced its intention to establish the Green Exchange as a joint venture among NYMEX and a number of major market participants. In anticipation of completing negotiations among these parties, NYMEX launched a comprehensive range of environmental futures, options and swap contracts for markets focused on solutions to climate change and renewable energy. These products will be committed to the Green Exchange upon completion of definitive documentation establishing the Green Exchange as a separate entity. Negotiations with the founding members of the Green Exchange are ongoing. Korea Exchange. In 2008, we finalized our five-year agreement with KRX to list the KOSPI 200 futures contract on CME Globex during nighttime trading hours in Korea. As part of the agreement, we will create a telecommunications hub in Seoul. Singapore Exchange Limited. In October 2006, we renewed our mutual offset agreement with the Singapore Exchange for an additional three-year term with automatic renewals for one year each unless terminated by either party. This relationship allows a clearing firm of either exchange initiating trades in certain products on either exchange to execute after-hours trades at the other exchange in those products, then transfer them back to the originating exchange. As a result of the merger with CBOT Holdings, we also list the products of the Minneapolis Grain Exchange and the Kansas City Board of Trade on the CME Globex platform and act as their sole distributor of market data. 16 Table of Contents In 2008, we agreed to wind down FXMarketSpace, our joint venture with Reuters Group PLC that created a centrally cleared, global over-the-counter foreign exchange marketplace. Marketing Programs and Advertising Our marketing programs align our core business objectives and product line goals with positioning, messaging and customer targeting strategies designed to increase awareness and use of our products. The marketing strategy and tactics include conducting market research to gather customer insight, and the implementation of our marketing campaigns, which may include online and print advertising, direct marketing, public relations, online marketing and educational programs. Our marketing programs primarily target institutional customers and, to a lesser extent, individual traders. Our marketing programs for institutional customers aim to inform traders, portfolio managers, corporate treasurers and other market professionals about novel uses of our products, such as new hedging and risk management strategies. We also strive to educate these users about changes in product design, performance bond requirements and new clearing services. We participate in major domestic and international trade shows and seminars regarding futures contracts and options on futures contracts and other derivatives products. In addition, we sponsor educational workshops and marketing events designed to educate market users about our products. Through these relationships and programs, we attempt to understand the needs of our customer base and use information provided by them to drive our product development efforts. Our advertising strategies seek to increase awareness and strengthen perceptions of CME Group among our institutional and retail customers, as well as support an increase in our trading volume. We increased our event-driven marketing to respond to current trends. For example, in light of the recent financial crisis, we created a targeted marketing program to highlight the benefits of our central counterparty clearing model and our financial safeguards package. The campaign included print advertising, online marketing and educational programs. Additionally in September 2008, we hosted our first-ever Global Financial Leadership Conference, where participants had an opportunity to interact with some of the world’s leaders in business, finance and politics to discuss emerging geopolitical trends and debate critical economic issues. We were privileged to have former U.K. Prime Minister Tony Blair and former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker as our keynote speakers. Our primary method of advertising has been through print media, utilizing trade magazines and newsletters as well as daily business publications. However, we also use online, television sponsorship and other direct advertisements to reach our target audiences. Our marketing program includes corporate and product brochures, designed to communicate the depth and breadth of our capabilities; our annual report to shareholders, designed to showcase how key customers globally use our products to mitigate risk, in addition to presenting our financial results; and CME Group Magazine, a quarterly publication, designed to keep our customers up to date on developments that can enhance their successful participation in the derivatives industry. The magazine features customer case histories, new product information, technology updates, trend stories and news briefs and is made available on our Web site. Competition The industry in which we operate is highly competitive and we expect competition to continue to intensify. We encounter competition in all aspects of our business, including from entities having substantially greater capital and resources and offering a wider range of products and services and some operating under a different and possibly less stringent regulatory regime. Prior to the passage of the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000 (CFMA), futures trading was required to take place on, or subject to the rules of, a federally designated contract market. The costs and difficulty of obtaining contract market designation and corresponding regulatory requirements created significant barriers to entry for competing exchanges. The passage of the CFMA and other changing market dynamics have led to increasing competition from a number of different domestic and international sources of varied size, business objectives and resources. For example, the CFMA permits SEC-regulated and bank clearing organizations to clear a broad array of derivatives products in addition to the products that clearing organizations have traditionally cleared. The CFMA also permits banks and broker-dealers, and some of their affiliates, to offer and sell foreign exchange futures to retail customers without being subject to regulation under the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA). We now face competition from other futures, securities and securities option exchanges; over-the-counter markets; clearing organizations; consortia formed by our members and large market participants; alternative trade execution facilities; technology firms, including market data distributors and electronic trading system developers; and others. Competition in our Derivatives Business We believe competition among exchanges in the derivatives and securities business is based on a number of factors, including, among others: • depth and liquidity of markets; • transaction costs; 17 Table of Contents • breadth of product offerings and rate and quality of new product development; • transparency, reliability and anonymity in transaction processing; • connectivity; • technological capability and innovation; • efficient and secure settlement, clearing and support services; and • reputation. We believe that we compete favorably with respect to these factors, and that our deep, liquid markets; diverse product offerings; rate and quality of new product development; and efficient, secure settlement, clearing and support services distinguish us from our competitors. We believe that in order to maintain our competitive position, we must continue to expand globally; develop new and innovative products; enhance our technology infrastructure, including its reliability and functionality; and maintain liquidity and low transaction costs. Over the past few years there have been significant changes in the industry’s landscape as a result of the wave of consolidation and increased competition. For example, during the past three years, in addition to our mergers with CBOT Holdings and NYMEX Holdings, the following consolidations occurred: • NYSE Group acquired Archipelago Exchange, merged with Euronext and acquired the American Stock Exchange • IntercontinentalExchange (ICE) acquired the New York Board of Trade (NYBOT), the Winnipeg Commodity Exchange and Creditex Group Inc. • Deutsche Borse acquired the International Securities Exchange ICE also has a pending agreement to acquire the Clearing Corporation, an independent clearing house owned by large derivatives dealers. At the end of 2008, there were 52 futures exchanges located in 29 countries, including 6 exchanges in the United States. Additionally, there has been an increase in activity among derivative dealers, banks and other entities to form competing exchanges. In 2007, a consortium of 12 financial institutions formed an exchange, Electronic Liquidity Exchange (ELX), to enter the futures market initially listing interest rate products and targeting our U.S. Treasuries product line. Options Clearing Corporation will provide clearing and delivery service for the exchange and the National Futures Association will provide regulatory oversight. In November 2008, ELX filed an application with the CFTC for designation as a contract market. ELX is expected to become operational following receipt of regulatory approval. Additionally, other financial firms have invested in a number of projects in an effort to compete with existing futures exchanges, including Project Rainbow (targeting short-term Euribor and Sterling interest rate contracts) and Turquoise. These entrants into our industry may increase competitive pressure on us. Because equity futures contracts are alternatives to underlying stocks and a variety of equity option and other contracts provide an alternative means of obtaining exposure to the equity markets, we also compete with NYSE Euronext and other securities and options exchanges, dealer markets and alternative trading systems in this product line as well ICE in connection with its futures and options on futures contracts based on the Russell indexes. We face competition from the over-the-counter market with the trading of contracts similar to those traded or cleared on our exchanges, such as swaps, forward contracts and other exchange “look-alike” contracts, in which parties directly negotiate the terms of their contracts. We also face a threat of trading volume loss if a significant number of our traditional participants decide to trade futures or similar products among themselves without using any exchange or specific trading system. The CFMA allows nearly all of our largest customers to transact futures or similar products directly with each other. While those transactions raise liquidity and credit concerns, they may be attractive based on execution costs, flexibility of terms, negotiability of margin or collateral deposits, or other considerations. Additionally, changes under the CFMA permitting the establishment of stand-alone clearing facilities for futures and over-the-counter derivatives transactions will facilitate the mitigation of credit-risk concentrations arising from such transactions. Competition in our Transaction Processing Business In addition to the competition we face in our derivatives business, we face a number of competitors in our transaction processing and other business services, including: • other exchanges and clearing houses seeking to leverage their infrastructure; and • technology firms, including front-end developers, back-office processing systems firms and match-engine developers. In the past few years, there has been increased competition in the provision of clearing services. We compete with other derivatives exchanges that provide clearing services as well as with some of our largest customers who are part of clearing organizations. The 18 Table of Contents Clearing Corporation is owned by 17 shareholders, many of whom represent derivatives marketplace participants and market makers, and provides clearing services to third parties. As part of our strategic initiatives, we have been targeting the over-the-counter market, including our credit default swap initiative to facilitate the clearing of bilaterally executed trades. In December 2008, NYSE Euronext began clearing credit default swaps in Europe following regulatory approval. EUREX and ICE are also undertaking steps to provide these services. The Clearing Corp. has entered into a memorandum of understanding with ICE in connection with a cleared credit default swaps initiative to be acquired by ICE. ICE operates three regulated clearing houses to provide clearing services to its futures exchange. We believe that other exchanges may also undertake to provide clearing services. We believe competition in the transaction processing and business services market is based on, among other things, the cost of the services provided; quality and reliability of the services; timely delivery of the services; reputation; and value of linking with existing products, markets and distribution. Competition in our Market Data Business Technology companies, market data and information vendors and front-end software vendors also represent potential competitors because, as purveyors of market data, these firms typically have substantial distribution capabilities. As technology firms, they also have access to trading engines that can be connected to their data and information networks. Additionally, technology and software firms that develop trading systems, hardware and networks that are otherwise outside of the financial services industry may be attracted to enter our markets. This may lead to decreased demand for our market data. Regulatory Matters Our operations as a futures exchange have historically been subject to extensive regulation by the CFTC. The CFTC is an independent federal agency with exclusive jurisdiction over the futures market. The Commission consists of five Commissioners, appointed to staggered five-year terms by the President, with the advice and consent of the Senate. The CFTC carries out the regulation of the futures markets in accordance with the provisions of the CEA and the CFMA. The CFTC is subject to reauthorization every five years, which most recently occurred in 2008. Although the CFMA significantly reduced our regulatory burdens, we remain extensively regulated by the CFTC. In light of the widespread financial and economic difficulties, particularly acute in the latter half of 2008 and early 2009, there have been many calls for a restructuring of the regulation of financial markets. In light of the transition to a new Presidential administration, these new proposals as well as previous proposals calling for the merger of the CFTC and the SEC, such as the Department of Treasury’s Blueprint for a Modernized Financial Regulatory Structure, we cannot predict what a restructured regulatory framework will look like or what impact it may have on our business. The President’s appointee to lead the CFTC has recently called for more regulation of futures markets and expressed concern respecting the impact of speculation on price volatility. Draft bills circulating in Congress call for restrictions on speculative trading by means of hard position limits in all contracts and limitations on hedge exemptions that could affect trading volume. In addition, future regulations could limit speculation in our markets or include a more rules-based approach rather than our current principles-based approach under the CFTC regulatory regime. To the extent the regulatory environment is less beneficial for us, our business, financial condition and operating results could be negatively affected. The CFMA amended the CEA in 2000 and created the current principles-based regulatory approach. For regulated markets, the CFMA codified a three-tiered regulatory structure for the trading of derivatives that distinguishes among markets based on the types of contracts traded and the sophistication of the market participants. The CFMA generally requires that contract markets, such as our primary exchanges (CME, CBOT, NYMEX and COMEX), register with the CFTC and establish their compliance with seventeen core principles: rule compliance and enforcement; listing of contracts not readily susceptible to market manipulation; trade monitoring system; position limits; emergency authority; information availability; daily publication of trading information; contract execution; procedures for recording and safe storage of trade information; financial integrity; market participant protections; dispute resolution; fitness standards; conflict of interest management; governing board composition; recordkeeping; and antitrust considerations. Additionally, the CFMA generally requires that derivatives clearing organizations, like our clearing house, register with the CFTC and demonstrate their compliance with thirteen core principles: financial, operational and managerial resources; member and product eligibility; risk management procedures and tools; adequate settlement procedures; treatment of customer funds; member default procedures; rule monitoring and enforcement system; clearing system safeguards; reporting; recordkeeping; public information; information sharing; and antitrust considerations. Under the oversight of the CFTC, our exchanges are operated as separate self-regulatory organizations. Generally this requires the promotion of market integrity; protection of investors; and enforcement of financial requirements, sales and trading practices of members. CBOT, NYMEX and COMEX outsource responsibility for trade matching, regulatory and clearing services to CME. Our integrated compliance and market surveillance functions allow detailed tracking of all trading and clearing activities. Our regulatory processes are reviewed and audited by the CFTC. Demutualization and the increasing utilization of electronic trading systems by traders from remote locations may, among other developments, impact our ability to continue the traditional form of “self-regulation” that has been an integral part of the CFTC regulatory program. 19 Table of Contents We have also “notice registered” with the SEC as a special purpose national securities exchange solely for the purpose of trading security futures products. As a result, the SEC is authorized to review some of our rules relating to these security futures products. Our members trading those products are subject to registration requirements and duties and obligations to customers under the securities laws that do not pertain to their other futures business. The proposed Presidential budget has, from time to time, included a proposal to impose a transaction tax on futures traded domestically. Additionally, recently proposed legislation has included a tax on certain transactions in an effort to generate additional funding to support the costs of the recently enacted economic stimulus package. While many participants in the futures industry, including us, oppose these proposals, we cannot guarantee that such proposals will not be enacted. The imposition of any such tax would increase the cost of using our products and, consequently could adversely impact our trading volumes, revenues and profits and may also adversely impact our ability to compete on an international level. Our Members We operate four separate self-regulatory exchanges: CME, CBOT, NYMEX and COMEX. Individuals may be members at any or all of the exchanges to trade our products. Members are individual traders, as well as most of the world’s largest banks, hedge funds, brokerages and investment houses. Trading on our open outcry trading floors is conducted exclusively by members in Chicago and New York City. Members can execute trades for their own accounts, for clearing firm accounts, for the accounts of other members or for the accounts of customers of clearing firms. Members who trade for their own account, including those who lease trading rights, qualify for lower transaction fees in recognition of the market liquidity that their trading activity provides. These members also benefit from market information advantages that may accrue from their proximity to activity on the trading floors. In 2008, our members were responsible for 79% of our total trading volume. As of December 31, 2008, there were approximately 130 clearing firms. Membership enables a customer to trade specific products at reduced rates and lower fees, and to trade directly from the applicable trading floor or electronically through CME Globex. Memberships can be bought, sold and leased. A customer can apply for and hold a membership at CME, CBOT, NYMEX or COMEX – depending on the products that will be traded. Rights and privileges of membership are exchange-specific. A potential member must file with the National Futures Association (NFA) either as a floor trader or floor broker if they intend to access one of our trading floors. If a customer will use the membership for the purpose of filling orders for other members or customers they must apply to the NFA for a floor broker’s license. Applicants for membership are required to be of good moral character, reputation and business integrity. They must also have adequate financial resources and credit to assume the responsibilities and privileges of membership. All members must understand the rules and regulations of the applicable exchange and agree to abide by them. Additionally, they must comply with the provisions of the CEA and the rules and regulations issued by the CFTC. Our market regulation department is the investigative and enforcement arm of our exchanges with regard to exchange rules. Members who are found to have violated a rule can be subject to sanctions such as fines, trading suspensions and/or expulsion from the particular exchange. Our shareholder relations and membership services department maintains an auction market for trading rights at our exchanges. CME Memberships There are four divisions of membership at CME: the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) division; the International Monetary Market (IMM) division; the Index and Option Market (IOM) division; and the Growth and Emerging Markets (GEM) division. Each membership division has different trading rights. Under the terms of CME Group’s certificate of incorporation, members of the CME exchange, as Class B shareholders, have the ability to protect their rights to trade by means of special approval rights over changes to the operation of the markets and are entitled to elect six of the directors on our board, which is currently comprised of a total of 33 individuals. In particular, the certificate of incorporation grants the holders of our Class B common stock the right to approve any changes to the trading floor rights, access rights and privileges that a member has, the number of memberships in each membership class and the related number of authorized shares in each class of Class B common stock and the eligibility requirements to exercise trading rights or privileges. Class B shareholders must approve any changes to these special rights. We are also required to maintain open outcry trading so long as certain liquidity thresholds are met. Class B shares have the same equitable interest in our earnings and receive the same dividend payments as our Class A shares. 20 Table of Contents CBOT Memberships There are five series of Class B memberships in CBOT represented by memberships in our CBOT subsidiary: Series B-1 (Full) members, Series B-2 (Associate) members, Series B-3 (GIM) members, Series B-4 (IDEM) members and Series B-5 (COM) members. Class B members of CBOT do not possess the right to receive any dividends or distributions, including the proceeds from liquidation, from CBOT. Series B-1 and B-2 members have the right to vote on amendments to certain provisions of the certificate of incorporation of CBOT, including the number of authorized memberships; the relative voting rights of the Series B-1 and B-2 members; the trading rights, voting rights and core rights of Class B members and certain other covenants; and the commitment to maintain open outcry markets for so long as they meet certain liquidity thresholds. Additionally, during the five-year period following the CBOT merger, we are required to provide the CBOT directors, as defined in the bylaws of CME Group, with five business days’ advance notice of any change to CBOT’s rules and regulations. If a majority of the CBOT directors determine in their sole discretion that the proposed change will materially impair the business of CBOT or the business opportunities of the holders of the Class B memberships of CBOT, such change will be submitted to a committee of the board of directors of CBOT comprised of three CBOT directors and two CME directors as defined in the bylaws. NYMEX Memberships In connection with the NYMEX Holdings merger, we made certain commitments to the NYMEX Class A members to maintain a trading floor in New York City as long as certain profitability and revenue thresholds are met, to limit our rights to relocate open outcry trading to Chicago for NYMEX products, which are no longer available for trading on the NYMEX floor, and to maintain fee differentials for NYMEX Class A members for as long as we maintain differentials for our CME and/or CBOT members. Substantially all other rights, including the revenue sharing rights contained in Section 311(G) of the previous bylaws of NYMEX, were eliminated in connection with the transaction. NYMEX Class A members do not have the right to receive dividends or distributions from NYMEX. COMEX Memberships Membership in COMEX entitles an individual or firm to trading rights, trading fees, access to open outcry trading and other benefits of membership. There are also COMEX Option memberships which exist on COMEX. The COMEX Transaction Agreement, executed in November 2006, provides COMEX Division members with certain trading right protections as well as a commitment to provide a trading facility in New York City for as long as open outcry trading exists on the COMEX Division and for a five-year period following the expiration of the COMEX Transaction Agreement. COMEX Division members maintain certain petition rights as it relates to proposed amendments to certain COMEX by-laws and rules. Subsidiaries Substantially all of our business operations are conducted through our exchange subsidiaries: CME, CBOT, and NYMEX. The following is a summary of the activities of our other operating subsidiaries: Credit Market Analysis. In March 2008, we acquired CMA and its subsidiaries. CMA is a leading provider of credit derivatives market data designed to enhance the performance of over-the-counter credit market professionals. CMA’s real-time pricing services (CMA QuoteVision) and data (CMA DataVision) are used by investment professionals in leading investment banks, hedge funds and asset managers worldwide. CMA entities accounted for less than 1% of our consolidated total revenues in 2008. C-B-T Corporation. C-B-T Corporation manages both our owned real estate and the general services relating to such real estate such as cleaning, power and telephone services in Chicago. GFX Corporation. GFX Corporation (GFX) was established for the purpose of maintaining and creating liquidity in our electronically traded foreign exchange futures contracts. Experienced foreign exchange traders employed by GFX buy and sell our foreign exchange contracts using our CME Globex system. They limit risk from these transactions through offsetting transactions using forward contracts and spot foreign exchange transactions with approved counterparties in the interbank market. On occasion, GFX has also engaged in the trading of CME Eurodollars and equity index contracts. GFX accounted for less than 1% of our consolidated total revenues in 2008, 2007 and 2006. Swapstream. In August 2006, we completed the acquisition of Swapstream and its subsidiaries. The Swapstream entities accounted for less than 1% of our consolidated total revenues in 2008, 2007 and 2006. 21 Table of Contents Licensing Agreements Standard & Poor’s We have had a licensing arrangement with S&P since 1980. In September 2005, all of our previous licensing agreements with S&P were consolidated into one agreement that terminates on December 31, 2017. Under the terms of the agreement, as amended, S&P granted us a license to use certain S&P stock indexes and the related trade names, trademarks and service marks in connection with the creation, marketing, trading, clearing and promoting of futures contracts and/or options on futures contracts that are indexed to certain S&P stock indexes. The license is exclusive through December 31, 2016 and non-exclusive from that date through December 31, 2017 with some exceptions. Our license for the S&P 500 Index remains exclusive through December 31, 2016 so long as certain minimum average trading volume is met or other circumstances exist that relate to the reduction in trading volume. We may pay an additional fee to retain the exclusivity if the minimum average trading volume is not met. For certain products based on S&P stock indexes that we list after the effective date of the amended and restated agreement, we will have an exclusive license for two or three years depending upon the nature of the index, after which we will retain our exclusive rights so long as certain minimum average trading volumes are met. Under the agreement, we maintain our right of first refusal for new stock indexes developed by S&P during the term of the agreement. In the event we fail to launch a product based on a new index within one year, subject to certain considerations for regulatory delays, S&P may elect to terminate the license for such new index or terminate the exclusivity of the license. In exchange for the license, we pay S&P a per trade fee. If S&P discontinues compilation and publication of any license or index, we may license, on a non-exclusive and royalty-free basis, the information regarding the list of companies, shares outstanding and divisors for that index or terminate the obligations regarding the index. The licenses become non-exclusive in the event we list certain competitive products. NASDAQ We have had a licensing arrangement with NASDAQ OMX since 1996 to license the NASDAQ-100 Index and related trade names, trademarks and service marks. The license was extended and expanded in October 2003 to license us both the NASDAQ-100 Index and the NASDAQ Composite Index and in April 2005 to add the NASDAQ Biotechnology Index for trading futures and options on futures contracts that are based on the indexes. In 2008, we agreed to extend the exclusive license agreement through 2019. With respect to the NASDAQ Composite Index, NASDAQ OMX may terminate the exclusivity or the entire license if trading volume fails to meet certain performance criteria on each anniversary of the agreement in October. During the applicable period of exclusivity, NASDAQ OMX will not grant a license to use the indexes in connection with the trading, marketing and promotion of futures contracts and options on those futures contracts that are based on an index that is exclusive to us. We pay per trade fees to NASDAQ OMX under the license. We have a right of first refusal for new indexes that are licensed for futures products where the index is substantially equivalent to an index licensed to us or is a subset of an index licensed to us. Dow Jones License Agreement We have a licensing agreement with Dow Jones to license certain Dow Jones stock indexes and the related trade names, trademarks and service marks in connection with the creation, marketing, trading, clearing and promoting of futures contracts and/or options on futures contracts that are based upon such Dow Jones stock indexes. Our license of the Dow Jones Composite Index, the Dow Jones Industrial Average Index, the Dow Jones Transportation Average Index and the Dow Jones Utility Average Index is exclusive, and non-exclusive for the Dow Jones U.S. Real Estate Index. We also have a right of first refusal for new indexes developed by Dow Jones prior to December 31, 2010 and the right to sublicense our exclusive license rights under the agreement to any other exchange for the trading of futures contracts and options on futures contracts. The initial term of the agreement is from January 1, 2008 through December 31, 2014. Following the initial term, the agreement shall automatically renew for a first renewal term of five years and then for successive annual renewal terms thereafter unless terminated by either party in writing prior to the end of the applicable term. In exchange for the license, we pay a per trade fee with a guaranteed annual minimum license fee and an upfront fee paid in January 2008. The Frank Russell Company We previously maintained a licensing arrangement with the Frank Russell Company to license the Russell 2000 Index and related trade names, trademarks and service marks. In June 2007, Russell provided notice to us that it did not intend to renew the agreement. In response to customer demands and to ensure an orderly transfer of liquidity, we listed our Russell contracts through the September 2008 expiration date. Intellectual Property We regard substantial elements of our brand name, marketing elements and logos, products, market data, software and technology as proprietary. We attempt to protect these elements by relying on trademark, service mark, copyright and trade secret laws, restrictions on disclosure and other methods. For example, with respect to trademarks, we have registered marks in numerous countries all over the world. We have filed numerous patent applications in the United States and internationally to protect our technology. In December, 2006, the United States Patent and Trademark Office granted CME its first patent. We now have 15 granted U.S. patents. 22 Table of Contents Our rights to stock indexes for our futures products principally derive from license agreements that we have obtained from S&P, NASDAQ OMX and Dow Jones and others. For a more detailed discussion of these licenses, see the section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K entitled “Item 1. Business—Licensing Agreements.” Various other CME Group products rely on license agreements from third parties. We cannot assure you that competitors will not attempt to enter these markets or create similar products. Nor can we assure you that we will be able to renew or maintain those license agreements beyond their current terms. We regularly review our intellectual property to identify property that should be protected, the extent of current protection for that property and the availability of additional protection. We believe our various trademarks and service marks have been registered or applied for where needed. We also seek to protect our software and databases as trade secrets and under copyright law. We have copyright registrations for certain of our software, user manuals, and databases. Legal developments allowing patent protection for methods of doing business hold the possibility of additional protection, which we continue to pursue. Patents of third parties may have an important bearing on our ability to offer certain of our products and services. It is possible that, from time to time, we may face claims of infringement that could interfere with our ability to use technology or other intellectual property that is material to our business. Employees As of December 31, 2008, we had approximately 2,300 employees. We consider relations with our employees to be good. We have never experienced a work stoppage. As of December 31, 2008, approximately 40 of our employees were represented by one of the following unions: • Chicago Regional Council of Carpenters; • International Union of Operating Engineers Local 399, AFL-CIO; and • Service Employees International Union, SEIU Local 1 and 25, AFL-CIO.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS In addition to the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating us and our business. Risks Relating to Our Business There can be no assurance that recently enacted legislation and stimulus programs will help stabilize the U.S. financial system. In light of the current financial crisis, legislation has been enacted, including the the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 and the President’s economic stimulus program, and additional legislation has been proposed for the purpose of stabilizing and providing liquidity to the U.S. financial markets and improving the overall economy. There can be no assurance, however, as to the actual impact that this legislation will have on the financial markets, including the extreme levels of volatility and limited credit availability currently being experienced. The government investment in financial services firms could also lead to new regulations and governmental oversight. The failure of these regulations to help stabilize the financial markets and a continuation or worsening of current financial market conditions or the imposition of additional regulations in the financial services industry could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, access to credit or the trading price of our Class A common stock. Current levels of the capital and credit market volatility are unprecedented. The capital and credit markets have been experiencing volatility and disruption for more than 12 months. During this period, the volatility and disruption has reached unprecedented levels. In some cases, the markets have produced downward pressure on stock prices and credit availability for certain issuers without regard to those issuers’ underlying financial strength. If current levels of market disruption and volatility continue or worsen, there can be no assurance that we will not experience an adverse effect, which may be material, on our ability to access capital, including future commercial paper issuances, and on our business, financial condition and results of operations as well as on our ability to pay off our fixed and floating rate notes as they become due. Current market developments may adversely affect our industry, business and results of operations. We generate revenues primarily from our clearing and transaction fees. Declines in trading volumes and market liquidity would adversely affect our business and financial condition. During 2008 and 2009, the global financial services industry and securities markets have experienced significant and adverse conditions, including significantly increased volatility, outflows of customer funds and securities, losses resulting from declining asset values, defaults on securities and reduced liquidity. As a result, many financial institutions have required additional capital infusions, merged with larger and stronger institutions, become bank holding companies that are regulated by the Federal Reserve Bank and, in some cases, have failed. As a result of this instability of the financial markets and the lack of readily available credit, commercial banks, investment banks, mutual and hedge funds and other of our customers have already decreased and could in the future further decrease their risk exposure and trading volume. This circumstance has resulted in a decrease in the trading of our benchmark interest rate products. In addition, interest rates have stabilized at low levels and we have experienced a decreased demand to hedge interest rate exposure using our markets. For example, the average daily volume for CME Eurodollar options decreased by 27% to 0.9 million contracts per day in 2008 when compared with 2007. Overall, average daily volume for our entire interest rate product line was down compared with 2007. If our customers further reduce their level of trading activity for any reason, including a reduction in the number of traders, reduced trading demand by their customers or a decision to curtail or cease speculative trading, our business and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. 25 Table of Contents Current trends in the global financial markets could cause significant fluctuations in our stock price. Stock markets in general, and stock prices of participants in the financial services industry in particular, including us, have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price for securities. The market price of our Class A common stock may continue to be subject to similar market fluctuations which may be unrelated to our operating performance or prospects, and increased volatility could result in a further decline in the market price of our Class A common stock. Factors that could significantly impact the volatility of our stock price include: • developments in our business or in the financial sector generally, including the effect of direct governmental action in financial markets generally and with respect to futures exchanges in particular; • regulatory changes affecting our industry generally or our business and operations; • the operating and securities price performance of companies that investors consider to be comparable to us; • changes in global financial markets and global economies and general market conditions, such as interest or foreign exchange rates, stock, commodity or asset valuations or volatility; • operating results that may be worse than the expectations of management, securities analysts and investors; and • market developments that affect our customers causing a decrease in the use of our products. Any reduction in our credit rating could increase the cost of our funding from the capital markets. Our long-term debt is currently rated investment grade by two of the major rating agencies. These rating agencies regularly evaluate us and their ratings of our long-term debt are based on a number of factors, including our financial strength as well as factors not entirely within our control, including conditions affecting the financial services industry generally. In light of the difficulties in the financial services industry and the financial markets, there can be no assurance that we will maintain our current ratings. Our failure to maintain those ratings could adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain funding and increase our cost of capital. Our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and operations and prevent us from fulfilling our debt service obligations. We may still be able to incur more debt, intensifying these risks. As of December 31, 2008, we had approximately $3.2 billion of total indebtedness. Additionally, on February 9, 2009, we issued an additional $750 million of unsecured notes at an interest rate of 5.75% due 2014. We used a portion of the net proceeds from the offering to repay the outstanding commercial paper borrowings backstopped by our $1.3 billion 364-day revolving bridge facility and subsequently terminated the bridge facility. After the termination of the bridge facility, we have excess borrowing capacity for general corporate purposes of approximately $0.2 billion. Our indebtedness could have important consequences. For example, our indebtedness may: • require us to dedicate a significant portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt, thereby reducing the availability of cash flow to fund capital expenditures, pursue acquisitions or investments in new technologies, to pay dividends and for general corporate purposes; • increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic conditions; • limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in or challenges relating to our business and industry; • place us at a competitive disadvantage against any less leveraged competitors; and • subject us to interest rate exposure for our variable interest rate debt, to the extent not hedged. The occurrence of any one of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, prospects, and ability to satisfy our debt service obligations. In addition, the agreements governing our outstanding indebtedness do not significantly limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness, which could increase the risks described above. 26 Table of Contents Our investment in BM&F subjects us to investment and currency risk. We own an interest in BM&F representing approximately 5%. As an exchange, BM&F’s ability to maintain or expand their trading volume and operate their business is subject to the same types of risks to which we are subject. For the year ended December 31, 2008, we took a pre-tax, non-cash impairment charge of $275 million on our cross-equity investment in BM&F, due to the decline in BM&F’s stock price relative to our original investment. In connection with this charge, we also reduced stockholder’s equity by $94 million due to unfavorable movements in the Brazilian real compared with the U.S. dollar because BM&F’s stock is valued in Brazilian real. To mitigate our financial exposure to the currency risk of the investment, we purchased an option to hedge against fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and the Brazilian real with Lehman Brothers Special Financing Inc. As a result of the bankruptcy filing of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., our hedging arrangement was terminated and our currency exposure is no longer mitigated. There is no guarantee that our investment in BM&F will be profitable. Under the terms of the transaction, we may not sell our shares in BM&F until February 2012. Any impairment of our goodwill and other intangible assets or investments may result in material, non-cash write downs and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and shareholders’ equity. In connection with our acquisitions, including our mergers with CBOT Holdings and NYMEX Holdings, we have recorded goodwill and identifiable intangible assets. We assess goodwill and intangible assets for impairment by applying a fair-value based test looking at historical performance, capital requirements and projected cash flows on an annual basis or more frequently if indicators of impairment arise. In the fourth-quarter 2008, we recorded a pre-tax, non-cash impairment charge of $275 million on our cross-equity investment in BM&F and, in connection with this charge, we reduced stockholder’s equity by $94 million due to unfavorable movements in the Brazilian real compared with the U.S. dollar. In the third-quarter 2008, we recorded an impairment charge of $15 million relating to our Swapstream acquisition. Although we did not experience any other events or circumstances in the year that indicated that the carrying amounts of our other intangible assets and goodwill were impaired, we could experience future events that result in impairments. The risk of impairment losses may increase to the extent our market capitalization and earnings decline. For example, during 2008, we experienced a significant decline in our stock price. While we believe this decline was principally driven by external circumstances, such as the decline in the stock market overall, and is not necessarily a reflection of changes in our business model, a continued decline in our stock value would be a factor in future assessments whether due to external factors and/or a continued decline in our volumes. An impairment of the value of our existing goodwill and intangible assets could have a significant negative impact on our future operating results and could have an adverse impact on our ability to satisfy the financial ratios or other covenants under our existing or future debt agreements. Shareholders who own trading rights or are officers or directors of firms who own trading rights on our exchanges account for 20 of the 33 directors on our board. These shareholders may have interests that differ from or conflict with those of shareholders who are not also members. Our dependence on the trading and clearing activities of our members, combined with their rights to elect directors, may enable them to exert substantial influence over the operation of our business. Twenty of our 33 directors on our board own or are officers or directors of firms who own trading rights on our exchange. We are dependent on the revenues from the trading and clearing activities of our members. This dependence may give them substantial influence over how we operate our business. Many of our members and clearing firms derive a substantial portion of their income from their trading or clearing activities on or through our exchanges. In addition, trading rights on our exchanges have substantial independent value. The amount of income that members derive from their trading, brokering and clearing activities and the value of their trading rights are, in part, dependent on the fees they are charged to trade, broker, clear and access our markets and the rules and structure of our markets. As a result, holders of our Class A common stock may not have the same economic interests as our members. In addition, our members may have differing interests among themselves depending on the role they serve in our markets, their method of trading and the products they trade. Consequently, members may advocate that we enhance and protect their clearing and trading opportunities and the value of their trading privileges over their economic interest in us. The rights of our members, including the board representation rights of the members of our CME exchange to elect six directors and the rights described in the immediately following risk factor, could be used to influence how our business is changed or developed, including how we address competition and how we seek to grow our volume and revenue and enhance shareholder value. 27 Table of Contents Our members have been granted special rights, which protect their trading privileges, require that we maintain open outcry trading until volumes are not significant and, in the case of our Class B shareholders, provide them with special board representation. Under the terms of the organizational documents of our exchanges, our members have certain rights that relate primarily to trading right protections, certain trading fee protections and certain membership benefit protections. Additionally, our Class B shareholders, who are members of our CME exchange, are also entitled to elect six of the 33 directors on our board; even if their Class A share ownership interest is very small or non-existent. In connection with these rights, our ability to take certain actions that we may deem to be in the best interests of the company and its shareholders, including actions relating to the operation of our open outcry trading facilities and certain pricing decisions, may be limited by the rights of our members. Our business is subject to the impact of domestic and international market and economic conditions, which are beyond our control and which could significantly reduce our trading volumes and make our financial results more volatile. Our revenue is substantially dependent on the trading volume in our markets. Our trading volume is directly affected by U.S. domestic and international factors that are beyond our control, including the factors described in the preceding risk factor as well as: • economic, political and geopolitical market conditions; • natural disasters and other catastrophes; • broad trends in industry and finance; • changes in price levels and volatility in the derivatives markets and in underlying fixed-income, equity, foreign exchange and commodity markets; • legislative and regulatory changes; • competition; • changes in government monetary policies; • consolidation in our customer base and within our industry; and • inflation. Any one or more of these factors may contribute to reduced activity in our markets. Historically, our trading volume has tended to increase during periods of uncertainty due to increased hedging activity and needs to manage the risks associated with or speculate on volatility in the U.S. equity markets, fluctuations in interest rates and price changes in the foreign exchange, commodity and other markets. However, during the current economic volatility, we have experienced decreased volume due primarily to our customers decreasing their risk exposure, stable low interest rates and the lack of available capital. Recent events in the economic environment, including the sub-prime lending crisis, the downturn in the housing market, decreases in consumer spending and the failure of major financial institutions have resulted in an economic recession. As a result, period-to-period comparisons of our financial results are not necessarily meaningful. This trend as well as future economic uncertainty may result in continued decreased trading volume and a more difficult business environment for us. Material decreases in trading volume would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results. Our quarterly operating results fluctuate due to seasonality. As a result, you will not be able to rely on our operating results in any particular quarter as an indication of our future performance. Generally, we have historically experienced relatively higher trading volume during the first and second quarters and sequentially lower trading volume in the third and fourth quarters. As a result of this seasonality, you will not be able to rely on our operating results in any particular period as an indication of our future performance. If we fail to meet securities analysts’ expectations regarding our operating results, the price of our Class A common stock could decline substantially. 28 Table of Contents Our average rate per contract is subject to fluctuation due to a number of factors. As a result, you will not be able to rely on our average rate per contract in any particular period as an indication of our future average rate per contract. Our average rate per contract, which impacts our operating results, is subject to fluctuation due to shifts in the mix of products traded, the trading venue and the mix of customers (whether the customer receives member or non-member fees or participates in one of our various incentive programs) and the impact of our tiered pricing structure. For example, we earn a higher rate per contract for trades executed electronically. In addition, our members and participants in our various incentive programs generally are charged lower fees than our non-member customers. Variation in each of these factors is difficult to predict and will have an impact on our average rate per contract in the particular period. Because of this fluctuation, you may not be able to rely on our average rate per contract in any particular period as an indication of our future average rate per contract. If we fail to meet securities analysts’ expectations regarding our operating results, the price of our Class A common stock could decline substantially. Our cost structure is largely fixed. If our revenues decline and we are unable to reduce our costs, our profitability will be adversely affected. Our cost structure is largely fixed. We base our cost structure on historical and expected levels of demand for our products and services. If demand for our products and services and our resulting revenues decline, we may not be able to adjust our cost structure on a timely basis. In that event, our profitability will be adversely affected. The success of our markets will depend on our ability to complete development of and successfully implement electronic trading systems that have the functionality, performance, reliability and speed required by our customers. The future success of our business depends in large part on our ability to create interactive electronic marketplaces in a wide range of derivatives products that have the required functionality, performance, capacity, reliability and speed to attract and retain customers. A significant portion of our current overall volume is generated through electronic trading on our CME Globex electronic platform. We must continue to enhance our electronic trading platform to remain competitive. As a result, we will continue to be subject to risks, expenses and uncertainties encountered in the rapidly evolving market for electronic transaction services. These risks include our failure or inability to: • provide reliable and cost-effective services to our customers; • develop, in a timely manner, the required functionality to support electronic trading in our key products in a manner that is competitive with the functionality supported by other electronic markets; • match fees of our competitors that offer only electronic trading facilities; • attract independent software vendors to write front-end software that will effectively access our electronic trading system and automated order routing system; • respond to technological developments or service offerings by competitors; and • generate sufficient revenue to justify the substantial capital investment we have made and will continue to make to enhance our electronic trading platform. If we do not successfully enhance our electronic trading platform, or our current or potential customers do not accept it, our revenues and profits will be adversely affected. In addition, if we are unable to develop our electronic trading systems to include other products and markets, or if our electronic trading systems do not have the required functionality, performance, capacity, reliability and speed, we may not be able to compete successfully in an environment that is increasingly dominated by electronic trading. 29 Table of Contents If we experience systems failures or capacity constraints, our ability to conduct our operations and execute our business strategy could be materially harmed and we could be subjected to significant costs and liabilities. We are heavily dependent on the capacity, reliability and security of the computer and communications systems and software supporting our operations. We receive and/or process a large portion of our trade orders through electronic means, such as through public and private communications networks. Our systems, or those of our third party providers, may fail or operate slowly, causing one or more of the following to occur: • unanticipated disruptions in service to our customers; • slower response times; • delays in our customers’ trade execution; • failed settlement of trades; • incomplete or inaccurate accounting, recording or processing of trades; • financial losses; • security breaches; • litigation or other customer claims; • loss of customers; and • regulatory sanctions. We cannot assure you that we will not experience systems failures from power or telecommunications failure, acts of God, war or terrorism, human error, natural disasters, fire, sabotage, hardware or software malfunctions or defects, computer viruses, acts of vandalism or similar events. If any of our systems do not operate properly or are disabled, including as a result of system failure, employee or customer error or misuse of our systems, we could suffer financial loss, liability to customers, regulatory intervention or reputational damage that could affect demand by current and potential users of our market. From time to time, we have experienced system errors and failures that have resulted in some customers being unable to connect to our electronic trading platform or erroneous reporting, such as transactions that were not authorized by any customer or reporting of filled orders as cancelled. For example, we have experienced technical failures that resulted in a temporary suspension of trading on the CME Globex platform. We cannot assure you that if we experience system errors or failures in the future that they will not have a material impact on our business. Any such system failures that cause an interruption in service or decrease our responsiveness could impair our reputation, damage our brand name or have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. Our status as a CFTC registrant generally requires that our trade execution and communications systems be able to handle anticipated present and future peak trading volume. Heavy use of our computer systems during peak trading times or at times of unusual market volatility could cause our systems to operate slowly or even to fail for periods of time. We constantly monitor system loads and performance and regularly implement system upgrades to handle estimated increases in trading volume. However, we cannot assure you that our estimates of future trading volume and order messaging traffic will be accurate or that our systems will always be able to accommodate actual trading volume and order messaging traffic without failure or degradation of performance. Increased CME Globex trading volume and order messaging traffic may result in connectivity problems or erroneous reports that may affect users of the platform. System failure or degradation could lead our customers to file formal complaints with industry regulatory organizations, to file lawsuits against us or to cease doing business with us or could lead the CFTC or other regulators to initiate inquiries or proceedings for failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations. We will need to continue to upgrade, expand and increase the capacity of our systems as our business grows and we execute our business strategy. Generally, our goal is to design our systems to handle at least one and a half times our peak historical transactions in our highest volume products. As volumes of transactions grow, the ability of our systems to meet this goal on an ongoing basis depends on our ability to increase our system capacity on a timely basis while maintaining system reliability. Although many of our systems are designed to accommodate additional volume and products and services without redesign or replacement, we will need to continue to make significant investments in additional hardware and software to accommodate the increases in volume of transactions and order transaction traffic and to provide processing services to third parties. If we cannot increase the capacity and capabilities of our systems to accommodate an increasing volume of transactions and to execute our business strategy, our ability to maintain or expand our businesses would be adversely affected. 30 Table of Contents We face intense competition from other companies, including some of our members. If we are not able to successfully compete, our business will not survive. The derivatives, securities and financial services industries are highly competitive. We expect that competition will continue to intensify. Our current and prospective competitors, both domestically and around the world, are numerous. They include securities and securities option exchanges, futures exchanges, over-the-counter markets, clearing organizations, market data and information vendors, electronic communications networks, crossing systems and similar entities, consortia of large customers, consortia of some of our clearing firms and electronic brokerage and dealing facilities. The global derivatives industry has grown increasingly competitive. Exchanges, intermediaries, and even end users are consolidating, and over-the-counter and unregulated entities are constantly evolving. Additionally, in response to growing competition, many marketplaces in both Europe and the United States have demutualized to provide greater flexibility for future growth. In 2007, we completed our merger with CBOT Holdings, NYSE Group completed its merger with Euronext and ICE acquired the New York Board of Trade and the Winnipeg Commodity Exchange. In 2008, we completed our acquisition of NYMEX Holdings. ICE also has a pending agreement to acquire the Clearing Corp., an independent clearing house owned by large derivatives dealers. In the last two years there has been a significant increase in activity among derivative dealers, banks and other entities to form competing exchanges. In 2007, a consortium of 12 financial institutions formed an exchange, ELX, to enter the futures market, initially listing interest rate products. In November 2008, ELX filed an application with the CFTC for designation as a contract market. ELX is expected to become operational following receipt of regulatory approval. Additionally, other financial firms have invested in a number of projects in an effort to compete with existing futures exchanges, including Project Four Seasons and Turquoise. These entrants into our industry may increase competitive pressure on us. We believe we may also face competition from large computer software companies and media and technology companies. The number of businesses providing internet-related financial services is rapidly growing. Other companies have entered into or are forming joint ventures or consortia to provide services similar to those provided by us. Others may become competitive with us through acquisitions. Federal law allows institutions that have been major participants on our exchange to trade the same or similar products among themselves without utilizing any exchange or trading system. Many of our competitors and potential competitors have greater financial, marketing, technological and personnel resources than we do. These factors may enable them to develop similar products, to provide lower transaction costs and better execution to their customers and to carry out their business strategies more quickly and efficiently than we can. In addition, our competitors may: • respond more quickly to competitive pressures, including responses based upon their corporate governance structures, which may be more flexible and efficient than our corporate governance structure; • develop products that are preferred by our customers; • develop risk transfer products that compete with our products; • price their products and services more competitively; • develop and expand their network infrastructure and service offerings more efficiently; • utilize better, more user-friendly and more reliable technology; • take greater advantage of acquisitions, alliances and other opportunities; • more effectively market, promote and sell their products and services; • better leverage existing relationships with customers and alliance partners or exploit better recognized brand names to market and sell their services; and • exploit regulatory disparities between traditional, regulated exchanges and alternative markets that benefit from a reduced regulatory burden and lower-cost business model. If our products, markets and services are not competitive, our business, financial condition and operating results will be materially harmed. A decline in our fees or any loss of customers could lower our revenues, which would adversely affect our profitability. Future changes in regulations as a result of the recent focus on the regulation of the financial industry in connection with the financial crisis, the combination of the SEC and the CFTC or otherwise, may adversely impact our ability to compete. 31 Table of Contents Our trading volume, and consequently our revenues and profits, would be adversely affected if we are unable to retain our current customers or attract new customers to our exchange. The success of our business depends, in part, on our ability to maintain and increase our trading volume. To do so, we must maintain and expand our product offerings, our customer base and our trade execution alternatives. Our success also depends on our ability to maintain our trading volume and to offer competitive prices and services in an increasingly price sensitive business. We cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to expand our product lines, or that we will be able to retain our current customers or attract new customers. The majority of the clearing and transaction fees we receive from our clearing firms represent charges for trades executed on behalf of their customers. We believe that in the event one of our clearing firms discontinues operations, the customer portion of that firm’s trading activity would likely transfer to another clearing firm. However, we cannot guarantee you that the discontinuation of any clearing firm would not result in our loss of customers or a loss of trading volume as a result of the consolidation of trading accounts at the acquiring firm which could have an adverse effect on our trading volumes or revenues. We also cannot assure you that we will not lose customers to low-cost competitors with comparable or superior products, services or trade execution facilities. If we fail to maintain our trading volume, expand our product offerings or execution facilities, or we lose a substantial number of our current customers, or a subset of customers representing a significant percentage of trading volume in a particular product line; or are unable to attract new customers, our business will be adversely affected. Furthermore, declines in trading volume due to loss of customers may negatively impact market liquidity, which could lead to further loss of trading volume. Any significant decline in the trading volume of our Eurodollar or S&P 500 futures and options on futures contracts would adversely affect our revenues and profitability. We are substantially dependent on trading volume from two product offerings for a significant portion of our clearing and transaction fee revenues and profits. The clearing and transaction fees revenue attributable to transactions in Eurodollar contracts and all our contracts based on the S&P 500 (including E-mini products) approximated 18% and 24%, respectively, of our total clearing and transaction fees revenue during the year ended December 31, 2008 and 32% and 24%, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2007. Any significant decline in our trading volume in either of these products would negatively impact our business, financial condition and operating results. Our Eurodollar futures and options on futures reflect LIBOR for a 3-month, $1 million offshore deposit maturing at some point in the future. The accuracy of LIBOR rates has come under scrutiny in recent months due to discrepancies in the borrowing costs in the currency forwards market and the rates reported by the British Bankers Association. As a result of this inconsistency, interest rate markets continue to reflect dislocations between Eurodollar and overnight rates. For example, in December 31, 2008, the average daily trading volume of our Eurodollar options contract was down 27% compared with 2007. The trading volumes of our Eurodollar contract may continue to be negatively impacted to the extent that LIBOR continues to be scrutinized. We also cannot assure you that competitors will not enter the Eurodollar market. Our members may also elect to trade Eurodollars in privately negotiated bilateral transactions without the use of our clearing house. In either of these events, our trading volume, revenues and profitability could be adversely affected. Our license agreement with S&P provides that the S&P 500 Index futures products will be exclusive through December 31, 2016 so long as certain minimum average trading volume is met or other circumstances exist that relate to the reduction in trading volume. We cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain the exclusivity of our licensing agreement with S&P. In addition, we cannot assure you that others will not succeed in creating stock index futures based on information similar to that which we have obtained by license or that market participants will not increasingly use other instruments, including securities and options based on the S&P indexes, to manage or speculate on U.S. stock risks. Parties may also succeed in offering indexed products that are similar to our licensed products without being required to obtain a license or in countries that are beyond the jurisdictional reach of us and/or our licensors. Our clearing house operations expose us to substantial credit risk of third parties and the soundness of our clearing firms could adversely affect us. CME, our subsidiary, owns and operates its own clearing house, which acts as the counterparty to all trades consummated on or through our futures exchanges or on third-party exchanges for which we provide clearing services. As a result, we have exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and we routinely guarantee transactions with counterparties in the financial industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, mutual and hedge funds, and other institutional customers. As a result of the recent financial crisis, many financial institutions have required additional capital infusions, merged with larger and stronger institutions, become bank holding companies that are regulated by the Federal Reserve Bank and, in some cases, have failed. For example, during 2008, The Bear Stearns Companies, Inc., Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. and American International Group, Inc., all of which were parent companies of clearing firms of our exchange, have experienced significant financial write-downs and in some cases failed. Although none of these cases resulted in a default of a clearing firm, additional companies, including our clearing firms, may encounter economic difficulties as a result of the market turmoil and the tightening of the credit market. 32 Table of Contents As part of our overall growth initiatives we are expanding our clearing services to the over-the-counter market in addition to standard futures and options on futures products, including through CME ClearPort and as a result of our proposed joint venture with Citadel to clear credit default swaps. The process for deriving margins and performance bonds for over-the-counter products is different and, in part, seeks to assess and capture different risks than our historical practices applied to our futures products. Although we believe that we have carefully analyzed the process for setting our financial safeguards for over-the-counter products, there is no guarantee that our risk management procedures will adequately protect us from the unique risks of these products as we have not historically provided clearing services to this market. A substantial part of our working capital is at risk if a clearing firm defaults on its obligations to our clearing house and its margin and security deposits are insufficient to meet its obligations. Although we have policies and procedures to help ensure that our clearing firms can satisfy their obligations, these policies and procedures may not succeed in detecting problems or preventing defaults. We also have in place various measures intended to enable us to cover any default and maintain liquidity. However, we cannot assure you that these measures will be sufficient to protect us from a default or that we will not be materially and adversely affected in the event of a significant default. The required capital and posted collateral of our clearing firms may lose value given the volatility of the market. To become a clearing member a firm must meet certain minimum capital requirements and must deposit a certain amount of funds with our clearing house as collateral for their trading activity. The funds used to satisfy these requirements may be cash or held in a variety of investments, such as regulated money market mutual funds, U.S. Treasury securities and asset-backed securities. Given the level of market volatility, there is no guarantee that these investments will continue to maintain their value. To the extent a clearing firm was not in compliance with these requirements, it would be required to acquire additional funds, decrease its proprietary trading activity and/or transfer customer accounts to another clearing firm. These actions could result in a decrease in trading activity in our products. A key element of our strategy is to provide transaction processing, clearing and related services to third parties. Our failure to identify future opportunities to provide these services will have a negative impact on our ability to grow our business. Providing third-party transaction processing, clearing and related services is a key element of our strategy. Pursuant to transaction-processing agreements we previously provided these services to NYMEX and to CBOT. Prior to our acquisition of these companies, we derived a significant amount of revenue from these services agreements. We have entered into other transaction-processing arrangements with BM&F, KRX and DME. We cannot assure you that such arrangements will be as profitable as our previous arrangements with NYMEX and CBOT or that we will enter into additional agreements to provide processing services in the future. Our failure to capitalize on our existing arrangement and to identify future opportunities may have a negative impact on our ability to generate additional revenues and grow our business. Our market data fees may be reduced or eliminated by decreased demand or the growth of electronic trading and electronic order entry systems. If we are unable to offset that reduction through terminal usage fees or transaction fees, we will experience a reduction in revenue. We sell our market data to individuals and organizations that use our markets or monitor general economic conditions. Revenues from our market data totaled $279.5 million, representing 11% of our total revenues, and $145.1 million, or 8% of our total revenues, during the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. A decrease in overall trading volume may also lead to a decreased demand for our market data from the market data vendors. For example, we believe that the decrease in the number of devices for CME and CBOT market data from approximately 293,000 at December 31, 2007 to approximately 290,000 at December 31, 2008 is due primarily to the consolidation of our customers and related headcount reductions as a result of the current financial crisis. Additionally, electronic trading systems do not usually impose separate charges for supplying market data to trading terminals. If we do not separately charge for market data supplied to trading terminals, and trading terminals with access to our markets become widely available, we could lose market data fees from those who have access to trading terminals. We will experience a reduction in our revenues if we are unable to recover that lost market data revenue through terminal usage fees or transaction fees. 33 Table of Contents We operate in a heavily regulated environment that imposes significant costs and competitive burdens on our business. Although the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000 significantly reduced our regulatory burdens, we remain extensively regulated by the CFTC. In light of the widespread financial and economic difficulties, particularly acute in the latter half of 2008 and early 2009, there have been many calls for a restructuring of the regulation of financial markets. In light of the transition to a new Presidential administration, these new proposals as well as previous proposals calling for the merger of the CFTC and the SEC, such as the Department of Treasury’s Blueprint for a Modernized Financial Regulatory Structure, we cannot predict what a restructured regulatory framework will look like or what impact it may have on our business. The President’s appointee to lead the CFTC has recently called for more regulation of futures markets and expressed concern respecting the impact of speculation on price volatility. Draft bills circulating in Congress call for restrictions on speculative trading by means of hard position limits in all contracts and limitations on hedge exemptions that could affect trading volume. In addition, future regulations could limit speculation in our markets or include a more rules-based approach rather than our current principles-based approach under the CFTC regulatory regime. To the extent the regulatory environment is less beneficial for us, our business, financial condition and operating results could be negatively affected. The CFTC has broad powers to investigate and enforce compliance and punish non-compliance with its rules and regulations. We cannot assure you that we and/or our directors, officers, employees and affiliates will be able to fully comply with these rules and regulations. We also cannot assure you that we will not be subject to claims or actions by the CFTC or other agencies. If we fail to comply with applicable laws, rules or regulations, we may be subject to censure, fines, cease-and-desist orders, suspension of our business, removal of personnel or other sanctions, including revocation of our designations as a contract market and derivatives clearing organization. Our international operations may be subject to similar regulations in specific jurisdictions. We are registered in a number of countries outside the United States. In some cases, our registrations are subject to annual review and such reviews may subject us to additional requirements in the future. We may also be required to register or become subject to regulation in other jurisdictions in order to accept business from customers in those jurisdictions. Also, from time to time, the President’s budget includes a proposal that a transaction tax be imposed on futures and options on futures transactions. Additionally, recently proposed legislation has included a tax on certain transactions in an effort to generate additional funding to support the costs of the recently enacted economic stimulus package. While those proposals have not been adopted to date, except for a limited per-contract fee on single stock futures and futures on narrow-based stock indexes, the imposition of any such tax would increase the cost of using our products and, consequently, could adversely impact our trading volumes, revenues and profits. We cannot assure you that such a tax will not be imposed in the future. Some of our largest clearing firms have indicated their belief that clearing facilities should not be owned or controlled by exchanges and should be operated as utilities and not for profit. These clearing firms have sought, and may seek in the future, legislative or regulatory changes that would, if adopted, enable them to use alternative clearing services for positions established on our exchanges. Even if they are not successful, these factors may cause them to limit the use of our markets. Some of our largest clearing firms, which are significant customers and intermediaries in our products, have stressed the importance to them of centralizing clearing of futures contracts and options on futures contracts in order to maximize the efficient use of their capital, exercise greater control over their value at risk and extract greater operating leverage from clearing activities. Many clearing firms have expressed the view that clearing firms should control the governance of clearing houses or that clearing houses should be operated as utilities rather than as part of for-profit enterprises. Some of these firms, along with the Futures Industry Association and the U.S. Department of Treasury, have sought, and may seek in the future, legislative or regulatory changes to be adopted that would facilitate mechanisms or policies that allow market participants to transfer positions from an exchange-owned clearing house to a clearing house owned and controlled by clearing firms. Our strategic business plan is to operate a vertically integrated transaction execution, clearing and settlement business for our futures and options on futures business. If these legislative or regulatory changes are adopted, our strategy and business plan may lead clearing firms to establish, or seek to use, alternative clearing houses for clearing positions established on our exchanges. Even if they are not successful in their efforts, the factors described above may cause clearing firms to limit or stop the use of our products and markets. If any of these events occur, our revenues and profits would be adversely affected. 34 Table of Contents The imposition in the future of regulations requiring that clearing houses establish linkages with other clearing houses whereby positions at one clearing house can be transferred to and maintained at, or otherwise offset by a fungible position existing at, another clearing house may have a material adverse effect on the operation of our business. In connection with the trading of single stock futures and futures on narrow-based stock indexes, the CFMA contemplates that, once certain market penetration thresholds are crossed, clearing houses will establish linkages enabling a position in any such product executed on an exchange for which it clears these products to be offset by an economically linked or fungible position on the opposite side of the market that is executed on another exchange utilizing a different clearing house. If, in the future, a similar requirement is imposed with respect to futures contracts generally, the resulting unbundling of trade execution and clearing services would have a material adverse effect on our revenues and profits. We, as well as many of our customers, depend on third party suppliers and service providers for a number of services that are important. An interruption or cessation of an important supply or service by any third party could have a material adverse effect on our business, including revenues derived from our customers’ trading activity. We depend on a number of suppliers, such as banking, clearing and settlement organizations, telephone companies, online service providers, data processors, and software and hardware vendors for elements of our trading, clearing and other systems, as well as communications and networking equipment, computer hardware and software and related support and maintenance. Many of our customers rely on third parties to provide them with front-end systems to access our CME Globex platform, such as independent software vendors. While these third parties are committed to keeping current with our enhancements and changes to our interfaces and functionality, we cannot guarantee that these third parties will continue to make the necessary monetary and time investments to keep up with our changes. In the event that these software programs do not interact with our platform seamlessly, our customers could be impacted which could lead to a decrease in trading volume. To the extent any of our service providers or the organizations that provide services to our customers in connection with their trading activities cease to provide these services in an efficient, cost-effective manner or fail to adequately expand their services to meet our needs, we could experience decreased trading volume, lower revenues and higher costs. Our networks and those of our third party service providers may be vulnerable to security risks, which could result in wrongful use of our information or cause interruptions in our operations that cause us to lose customers and trading volume and result in significant liabilities. We could also be required to incur significant expense to protect our systems. We expect the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks to continue to be a critical element of our operations. Our networks and those of our third party service providers and our customers may be vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer viruses and other security problems. Persons who circumvent security measures could wrongfully use our information or cause interruptions or malfunctions in our operations. Any of these events could cause us to lose customers or trading volume. We may be required to expend significant resources to protect against the threat of security breaches or to alleviate problems, including reputational harm and litigation, caused by breaches. Although we intend to continue to implement security measures, these measures may prove to be inadequate and result in system failures and delays that could cause us to lose customers, experience lower trading volume and incur significant liabilities. Our compliance and risk management methods might not be effective and may result in outcomes that could adversely affect our reputation, financial condition and operating results. Generally, the CFTC has broad enforcement powers to censure, fine, issue cease-and-desist orders, prohibit us from engaging in some of our businesses or suspend or revoke our designation as a contract market or the registration of any of our officers or employees who violate applicable laws or regulations. Our ability to comply with applicable laws and rules is largely dependent on our establishment and maintenance of compliance, audit and reporting systems, as well as our ability to attract and retain qualified compliance and other risk management personnel. We face the risk of significant intervention by regulatory authorities, including extensive examination and surveillance activity. In the case of non-compliance or alleged non-compliance with applicable laws or regulations, we could be subject to investigations and judicial or administrative proceedings that may result in substantial penalties or civil lawsuits, including by customers, for damages, which can be significant. Any of these outcomes would adversely affect our reputation, financial condition and operating results. In extreme cases, these outcomes could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business. 35 Table of Contents Our policies and procedures to identify, monitor and manage our risks may not be fully effective. Some of our risk management methods depend upon evaluation of information regarding markets, customers or other matters that are publicly available or otherwise accessible by us. That information may not in all cases be accurate, complete, up-to-date or properly evaluated. Management of operational, financial, legal, regulatory and strategic risk requires, among other things, policies and procedures to record properly and verify a large number of transactions and events. We cannot assure you that our policies and procedures will always be effective or that we will always be successful in monitoring or evaluating the risks to which we are or may be exposed. We could be harmed by misconduct or errors that are difficult to detect and deter. There have been a number of highly publicized cases involving fraud or other misconduct by employees of financial services firms in recent years. For example, in 2008 a mid-level trader at Societe Generale, engaged in unauthorized trading which cost Societe approximately $7 billion and a trader at MF Global, one our clearing firms, lost approximately $140 million in connection with unauthorized trades. Misconduct by our employees and agents, including employees of GFX, our wholly-owned subsidiary that engages primarily in proprietary trading in foreign exchange futures, could include hiding unauthorized activities from us, improper or unauthorized activities on behalf of customers or improper use of confidential information. Misconduct could subject us to financial losses or regulatory sanctions and seriously harm our reputation. It is not always possible to deter misconduct, and the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases. Our employees and agents, including our GFX employees, also may commit errors that could subject us to financial claims for negligence, as well as regulatory actions. As a financial services provider, we are subject to significant litigation risk and potential securities law liability. Many aspects of our business involve substantial liability risks. While we enjoy governmental immunity for some of our market-related activities, we could be exposed to substantial liability under federal and state laws and court decisions, as well as rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC and the CFTC. These risks include, among others, potential liability from disputes over terms of a trade, the claim that a system failure or delay caused monetary losses to a customer, that we entered into an unauthorized transaction or that we provided materially false or misleading statements in connection with a transaction. Dissatisfied customers frequently make claims regarding quality of trade execution, improperly settled trades, mismanagement or even fraud against their service providers. We may become subject to these claims as a result of failures or malfunctions of our systems and services we provide. We could incur significant legal expenses defending claims, even those without merit. In addition, an adverse resolution of any future lawsuit or claim against us could have a material adverse effect on our business. We may have difficulty executing our growth strategy and maintaining our growth effectively. We continue to focus on strategic initiatives to grow our business. For example, among our current growth initiatives is our goal to enter into the over-the-counter market. Some of our initiatives in this area are subject to additional regulatory approval, such as CFTC approval of new over-the-counter swap products and our pending exemption with the SEC relating to CMDX. There is no guarantee that our efforts will be successful. Continued growth will require additional investment in personnel, facilities, information technology infrastructure and financial and management systems and controls and may place a significant strain on our management and resources. We may not be successful in implementing all of the processes that are necessary to support our growth organically or, as described in the following risk factor, through acquisitions or other strategic alliances. Unless our growth results in an increase in our revenues that is proportionate to the increase in our costs (both hard and soft) associated with our growth, our future profitability could be adversely affected, and we may have to incur significant expenditures to address the additional operational and control requirements as a result of our growth. Our acquisition, investment and alliance strategy involves risks. If we are unable to effectively manage these risks, our business will be materially harmed. To achieve our strategic objectives, in the future we may seek to acquire or invest in other companies, businesses or technologies. Acquisitions entail numerous risks, including the following: • difficulties in the assimilation of acquired businesses or technologies; • diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns; • assumption of unknown material liabilities; • difficulties in implementing adequate compliance and risk management methods for new operations; • failure to achieve financial or operating objectives; • potential loss of customers or key employees of acquired companies; • exposure to foreign currency, which exposure may or may not be hedged or partially hedged; and 36 Table of Contents • difficulties in receiving approval from governmental authorities. We may not be able to integrate successfully any operations, personnel, services or products that we have acquired or may acquire in the future. See “Risks Relating to the Merger with NYMEX Holdings” for additional risks. We also may seek to expand or enhance some of our operations by forming joint ventures or alliances with various strategic partners throughout the world. Entering into joint ventures and alliances also entails risks, including difficulties in developing and expanding the business of newly formed joint ventures, exercising influence over the activities of joint ventures in which we do not have a controlling interest, and potential conflicts with our joint venture or alliance partners. We also cannot assure you that any joint venture or alliance that we have entered into, including our agreement with Citadel as discussed in the following risk factor, or may enter into in the future, will be successful. There is no guarantee that our credit default swap joint venture will be successful. In December 2008, we announced that we had entered into a binding agreement with Citadel to launch a joint venture company that would offer a clearing solution and trading platform for the credit default market. The joint venture company intends to provide a compression facility linked to clearing for existing credit default swaps, known as credit default swaps contracts, a trading platform for credit default swaps contracts and various forms of access to our clearing house to clear credit default swaps. The current regulatory environment for trading and clearing credit default swaps is uncertain. Draft bills that would severely curtail the trading of credit default swaps or that might have the effect of regulating such transactions as insurance are being considered. Several state insurance commissioners have given notice that they may assert jurisdiction. While we have completed the review process with the Federal Reserve Board of New York and the CFTC and are in the process of seeking certain exemptive relief from the SEC, we cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain and retain all regulatory relief necessary to begin operations. We cannot be certain that we will be able to operate profitably under the conditions imposed to secure regulatory approval or if legislation or regulation adversely affects trading of credit default swaps contracts or reduces the demand for the joint venture’s offerings. In addition, a number of market participants and exchanges are developing competing platforms. Government backed initiatives in the European Union may favor clearing platforms in the European Union. We cannot be certain that our platform will be able to compete effectively with these or other alternative platforms. Expansion of our operations internationally involves special challenges that we may not be able to meet, which could adversely affect our financial results. We plan to continue to expand our operations internationally, including by directly placing order entry terminals with customers outside the United States and by relying on distribution systems established by our current and future strategic alliance partners. We face certain risks inherent in doing business in international markets, particularly in the regulated derivatives exchange business. These risks include: • restrictions on the use of trading terminals or the contracts that may be traded; • becoming subject to extensive regulations and oversight, tariffs and other trade barriers; • difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations; • general economic and political conditions in the countries from which our markets are accessed, which may have an adverse effect on our volume from those countries; and • potentially adverse tax consequences. In addition, as a result of our expanding global operations, we may become subject to the laws and regulations of foreign governmental and regulatory authorities. These may include laws, rules and regulations relating to any aspect of the derivatives business. To date, we have had limited experience in marketing and operating our products and services internationally. We cannot assure you that we will be able to succeed in marketing our products and services in international markets. We may also experience difficulty in managing our international operations because of, among other things, competitive conditions overseas, management of foreign exchange risk, established domestic markets, language and cultural differences and economic or political instability. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on the success of our international operations and, consequently, on our business, financial condition and operating results. 37 Table of Contents We may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights, which may materially harm our business. We rely primarily on trade secret, copyright, service mark, trademark and patent law and contractual protections to protect our proprietary technology and other proprietary rights. We have filed several patent applications covering our technology in the United States and certain other jurisdictions. Notwithstanding the precautions we take to protect our intellectual property rights, it is possible that third parties may copy or otherwise obtain and use our proprietary technology without authorization or otherwise infringe on our rights. We also seek to protect our software and databases as trade secrets and under copyright law. We have copyright registrations for certain of our software, user manuals and databases. The copyright protection afforded to databases, however, is fairly limited. While the arrangement and selection of data generally are protectable, the actual data may not be, and others may be free to create databases that would perform the same function. In some cases, including a number of our most important products, there may be no effective legal recourse against duplication by competitors. In addition, in the future, we may have to rely on litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights, protect our trade secrets, determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or defend against claims of infringement or invalidity. Any such litigation, whether successful or unsuccessful, could result in substantial costs to us and diversions of our resources, either of which could adversely affect our business. Any infringement by us on patent rights of others could result in litigation and adversely affect our ability to continue to provide, or increase the cost of providing, our products and electronic execution services. Patents of third parties may have an important bearing on our ability to offer certain of our products and services. Our competitors as well as other companies and individuals may obtain, and may be expected to obtain in the future, patents related to the types of products and services we offer or plan to offer. We cannot assure you that we are or will be aware of all patents containing claims that may pose a risk of infringement by our products and services. In addition, some patent applications in the United States are confidential until a patent is issued and, therefore, we cannot evaluate the extent to which our products and services may be covered or asserted to be covered by claims contained in pending patent applications. These claims of infringement are not uncommon in our industry. In general, if one or more of our products or services were to infringe on patents held by others, we may be required to stop developing or marketing the products or services, to obtain licenses to develop and market the services from the holders of the patents or to redesign the products or services in such a way as to avoid infringing on the patent claims. We cannot assess the extent to which we may be required in the future to obtain licenses with respect to patents held by others, whether such licenses would be available or, if available, whether we would be able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms. If we were unable to obtain such licenses, we may not be able to redesign our products or services to avoid infringement, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. We may be at greater risk from terrorism than other companies. We may be more likely than other companies to be a direct target of, or an indirect casualty of, attacks by terrorists or terrorist organizations. It is impossible to predict the likelihood or impact of any terrorist attack on the derivatives industry generally or on our business. For example, the September 11, 2001 terrorist attack on the World Trade Center resulted in the closing of NYMEX’s trading and clearing operations for four business days and rendered its backup data and recovery center inoperable. While we have undertaken significant measures to develop business continuity plans and to establish backup sites, in the event of an attack or a threat of an attack, these security measures and contingency plans may be inadequate to prevent significant disruptions in our business, technology or access to the infrastructure necessary to maintain our business. Damage to our facilities due to terrorist attacks may be significantly in excess of any amount of insurance received, or we may not be able to insure against such damage at a reasonable price or at all. The threat of terrorist attacks may also negatively affect our ability to attract and retain employees. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. 38 Table of Contents Risks Relating to our Merger with NYMEX Holdings We may fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits of our acquisition of NYMEX Holdings On August 22, 2008, we completed our acquisition of NYMEX Holdings. The success of the transaction will depend, in part, on our ability to achieve the anticipated cost synergies and other strategic benefits from combining the businesses of CME Group and NYMEX Holdings. We expect CME Group to benefit from operational synergies resulting from the consolidation of capabilities and elimination of redundancies as well as greater efficiencies from increased scale, market integration and more automation. However, to realize these anticipated benefits, we must successfully combine the businesses of CME Group and NYMEX Holdings. If we are not able to achieve these objectives, the anticipated cost synergies and other strategic benefits of the transaction may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected. We may fail to realize some or all of the anticipated benefits of the transaction in the amounts and times projected for a number of reasons, including that the integration may take longer than anticipated or be more costly than anticipated. The failure to integrate successfully the businesses and operations of CME Group and NYMEX Holdings in the expected time frame may adversely affect CME Group’s future results. Prior to the completion of the transaction, CME Group and NYMEX Holdings historically operated as independent companies. The management of CME Group may face significant challenges in consolidating the functions of CME Group and NYMEX Holdings and their subsidiaries, integrating their technologies, organizations, procedures, policies and operations, as well as addressing differences in the business cultures of the two companies and retaining key personnel. In connection with the acquisition, CME Group expects to integrate certain operations of CME Group and NYMEX Holdings, including, among other things, back-office operations, information technology and regulatory compliance. However, the combined company will continue to operate a NYMEX trading floor at its existing location or an alternative location in New York, New York, as long as both revenue and profitability thresholds are achieved going forward. Given that historically CME Group has not operated a trading floor in a geographic location that is remote from its headquarters in Chicago, Illinois, continuing to operate a NYMEX trading floor in New York, New York may present unique challenges. The integration of the two companies will be complex and time consuming, and require substantial resources and effort. The integration process and other disruptions resulting from the transaction may disrupt ongoing businesses or cause inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that adversely affect our relationships with our members and other market participants, employees, regulators and others with whom we have business or other dealings. If we fail to manage the integration of these businesses effectively, our growth strategy and future profitability could be negatively affected, and we may fail to achieve the intended benefits of the transaction. We have incurred costs in connection with our acquisition of NYMEX Holdings and will continue to incur costs in connection with the transaction. CME Group and NYMEX Holdings have incurred significant costs associated with transaction fees, professional services and other costs related to the transaction and we will continue to incur additional costs, including restructuring costs, in connection with the integration of the business. Specifically, through December 31, 2008, CME Group and NYMEX Holdings have incurred approximately $104.5 million for transaction costs related to the transaction. Although CME Group expects that the realization of efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses will offset incremental transaction, merger-related and restructuring costs over time, this net benefit may not be achieved in the near term, or at all. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS Not applicable. ITEM 2. PROPERTIES Our corporate headquarters are located at 20 South Wacker Drive, Chicago, Illinois 60606. Effective as of August 24, 2007, we entered into a new lease at 20 South Wacker Drive, which was subsequently amended to include an expansion, providing for approximately 463,000 square feet of office, lobby and support space which includes the space that previously housed our lower trading floor space. The initial term of the lease expires in 2022 with two consecutive options to extend the term for seven and ten years, respectively. The lease also includes various expansion and contraction options. As a result of our merger with CBOT Holdings, we own three buildings located at 141 West Jackson Boulevard in Chicago, which consist of a total of approximately 1,500,000 square feet. We occupy approximately 441,000 square feet of office, trading floor and support space at this location. In May 2008, we completed the migration of the CME trading facilities to this location. 39 Table of Contents In connection with our acquisition of NYMEX, we own a 16-story building in downtown New York, New York. This building, which is on land leased from the Battery Park City Authority for a term expiring in June 2069, is one of five office buildings in a complex known as the World Financial Center. The construction of the 507,000 square foot building was completed in 1997 and houses open outcry trading for NYMEX and COMEX. As of December 31, 2008, approximately 152,000 square feet was leased to third parties. Our largest tenant at this location is ICE Futures U.S., Inc. (formerly known as NYBOT). We also lease additional office space at 550 West Washington in Chicago for approximately 220,000 square feet of office space on a phased-in basis through 2011 pursuant to a lease that expires in 2023. We maintain back up and remote data center locations as part of our disaster recovery initiative on property owned or leased in Illinois and New York. We also lease administrative office space in Washington, D.C.; Houston, Texas; Tokyo, Japan; Hong Kong, China; Mumbai, India; Shanghai, China; Singapore and Sydney, Australia and both administrative and communication equipment space in London, England. We believe our facilities are adequate for our current operations and that additional space can be obtained if needed. ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS From time to time, we are involved in legal proceedings and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we are not a party to or, to our knowledge, threatened with any litigation or other legal proceeding that, in our opinion, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition. NYMEX Holdings Merger Class Actions There are two purported class action complaints pending against the former NYMEX Holdings, the former NYMEX Holdings board of directors and CME Group in the Delaware Court of Chancery related to the merger between CME Group and NYMEX Holdings. The first complaint, amended as of October 6, 2008, is a purported consolidated class action on behalf of former NYMEX Holdings’ shareholders (the shareholder complaint) which alleges, among other things, that the NYMEX Holdings board of directors breached their fiduciary duties in approving the merger agreement by exclusively negotiating a transaction with CME Group without regard to the fairness of the transaction to the NYMEX Holdings shareholders, failing to take steps to maximize shareholder value, capping the minimum price of NYMEX Holdings’ stock, failing to properly value NYMEX Holdings, making changes to NYMEX Holdings’ change of control severance plan weeks before announcing that it was engaged in discussions with CME Group, requiring the Class A members to execute a waiver and release that allegedly is coercive because it is intended to deprive them of their rights to participate in this lawsuit as well as their rights to past, present and future royalty payments under Section 311(G) of the former bylaws of NYMEX, and failing to fully disclose material information related to the merger, including financial information and information necessary to prevent statements contained in the preliminary proxy from being misleading. The shareholder complaint further alleges that CME Group aided and abetted the alleged breach of fiduciary duties. The shareholder plaintiffs initially sought to enjoin the merger; however, they pulled the preliminary injunction hearing from the court’s calendar on August 5, 2008 after becoming satisfied that there had been adequate disclosures by NYMEX Holdings and CME Group. The shareholder plaintiffs now seek damages for the alleged breaches of fiduciary duties and a declaration that the waiver and release is invalid and unenforceable. On October 24, 2008, CME Group moved to dismiss the shareholder plaintiffs’ complaint. The second complaint, amended as of September 18, 2008, is a purported consolidated class action on behalf of NYMEX Class A members (the member complaint) which alleges claims substantially similar to those raised in the shareholder complaint. The member plaintiff initially sought to enjoin the merger; however, she pulled the preliminary injunction hearing from the court’s calendar on August 5, 2008 after becoming satisfied that there had been adequate disclosures by NYMEX Holdings and CME Group. The member plaintiff now seeks damages for the alleged breaches of fiduciary duties and a declaration that the waiver and release is invalid and unenforceable. On September 22, 2008, CME Group filed a motion to dismiss and stay discovery. On September 26, 2008, the member plaintiffs, jointly with the shareholder plaintiffs, filed a motion for declaratory judgment and requested an expedited hearing on their motion. On October 2, 2008, the Court denied the plaintiffs’ request for expedition and granted CME Group’s request to stay discovery in both actions. In March 2009, the court is expected to hear all outstanding motions (our motion for summary judgment and motion to dismiss and the plaintiffs’ motion for partial summary judgment). Based on its investigation to date and advice from counsel, the company believes this suit is without merit and intends to defend itself vigorously against these charges. 40 Table of Contents EUREX Action On October 14, 2003, the U.S. Futures Exchange, L.L.C. (Eurex U.S.) and U.S. Exchange Holdings, Inc., filed suit against CBOT and CME in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. The suit alleges that CBOT and CME violated the antitrust laws and tortiously interfered with the business relationship and contract between Eurex U.S. and The Clearing Corporation. Eurex U.S. and U.S. Exchange Holdings, Inc. are seeking a preliminary injunction and treble damages. On December 12, 2003, CBOT and CME filed separate motions to dismiss or, in the event the motion to dismiss is denied, to move the venue to the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. On September 2, 2004, the judge granted CBOT’s and CME’s motion to transfer venue to the Northern District of Illinois. In light of that decision, the judge did not rule on the motions to dismiss. On March 25, 2005, Eurex U.S. filed a second amended complaint in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. On June 6, 2005, CME and CBOT filed a motion to dismiss the complaint. On August 25, 2005, the judge denied the joint CME/CBOT motion to dismiss. The parties are currently engaged in discovery. On April 9, 2007, CME and CBOT filed two joint motions for summary judgment. Based on its investigation to date and advice from legal counsel, the company believes this suit is without merit and intends to defend itself vigorously against these charges. CBOE Class Action On August 23, 2006, CBOT Holdings and CBOT, along with a class consisting of certain CBOT full members, filed a lawsuit in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware against the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE). The lawsuit seeks to enforce and protect the exercise right privileges (ERPs). The lawsuit alleges that these ERPs allow CBOT’s full members who hold them to become full members of CBOE and to participate on an equal basis with other members of CBOE in CBOE’s announced plans to demutualize. On June 2, 2008, the parties reached a settlement in principle. Under the proposed settlement terms with CBOE, which are subject to execution of a class settlement agreement and to its approval by the Delaware Court, participating Class A members will share in an aggregate of 18 percent of the CBOE Holdings equity through the issuance of warrants that will be converted into non-voting common stock of CBOE Holdings convertible into voting common stock upon CBOE Holdings’ initial public offering. Class members will also be entitled to receive non-interest bearing notes for their pro rata share of $300.0 million. Participating Class B members will be paid $250,000 for each ERP owned. In December 2008, the judge heard objections to the proposed settlement. We are currently awaiting the court’s ruling on the approval of the settlement. Fifth Market On August 19, 2008, Fifth Market filed a complaint against CME Group and CME seeking a permanent injunction against CME’s Globex system and enhanced damages for what the plaintiff alleges is willful infringement, in addition to costs, expenses and attorneys’ fees. The suit alleges that CME infringes two U.S. patents. Based on its investigation to date and advice from legal counsel, the company believes this suit is without merit and intends to defend itself vigorously against these charges. ITEM 4. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS Not applicable. 41 Table of Contents PART II ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES Class A Common Stock Our Class A common stock is currently listed on NASDAQ under the ticker symbol “CME.” In June 2008, we elected to delist from the New York Stock Exchange and become solely listed on NASDAQ. As of February 18, 2009, there were approximately 2,200 holders of record of our Class A common stock. The following table sets forth the high and low sales prices per share of our Class A common stock on a quarterly basis, as reported on NASDAQ . 2008 High Low 2007 High Low First Quarter $ 686.43 $ 399.01 First Quarter $ 596.26 $ 510.00 Second Quarter 526.98 375.38 Second Quarter 565.00 497.00 Third Quarter 422.24 282.00 Third Quarter 609.92 506.50 Fourth Quarter 440.00 155.49 Fourth Quarter 714.48 593.58 Class B Common Stock Our Class B common stock is not listed on a national securities exchange or traded in an organized over-the-counter market. Each class of our Class B common stock is associated with a membership in a specific division of our CME exchange. CME’s rules provide exchange members with trading rights and the ability to use or lease these trading rights. Each share of our Class B common stock can be transferred only in connection with the transfer of the associated trading rights. The memberships by class are CME (Chicago Mercantile Exchange), IMM (International Monetary Market), IOM (Index and Option Market) and GEM (Growth and Emerging Markets). Class B shares and the associated trading rights are bought and sold through our shareholder relations and membership services department. In addition, trading rights may be leased through the department. Trading rights sales are reported on our Web site. Although our Class B shareholders have special voting rights, because our Class B shares have the same equitable interest in our earnings and the same dividend payments as our Class A shares, we expect that the market price of our Class B common stock, if reported separately from the associated trading rights, would be determined by the value of our Class A common stock. As of February 18, 2009, there were approximately 1,800 holders of record of our Class B common stock. Dividends The following table sets forth the dividends we paid on our Class A and Class B common stock in the last two years: Record Date Dividend per Share Record Date Dividend per Share March 10, 2008 $ 1.15 March 9, 2007 $ 0.86 June 10, 2008 1.15 June 8, 2007 0.86 September 10, 2008 1.15 September 10, 2007 0.86 September 25, 2008 5.00 December 10, 2007 0.86 December 10, 2008 1.15 We intend to pay regular quarterly dividends to our shareholders. The decision to pay a dividend, however, remains within the discretion of our board of directors and may be affected by various factors, including our earnings, financial condition, capital requirements, level of indebtedness and other considerations our board of directors deems relevant. Our existing credit facility as well as future credit facilities, other future debt obligations and statutory provisions may limit our ability to pay dividends. The September 25, 2008 dividend was a special dividend. On February 4, 2009, the board of directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of $1.15 per share to be paid on March 25, 2009, to shareholders of record on March 10, 2009. 42 Table of Contents PERFORMANCE GRAPH The following graph compares the cumulative five-year total return provided shareholders on our Class A common stock relative to the cumulative total returns of the S&P 500 index, and a customized peer group described below as of the end of the year. An investment of $100 (with reinvestment of all dividends) is assumed to have been made in our Class A common stock, in the peer group, and the index on December 31, 2003 and its relative performance is tracked through December 31, 2008.

Under the terms of the share buyback program announced on June 23, 2008, the company is authorized to purchase Class A common stock with a value of up to $1.1 billion, subject to market conditions. The buyback program will take place over a period of up to 18 months. The authorization of the board of directors permits the repurchase of shares through the open market, an accelerated program, a tender offer or privately negotiated transactions. The shares purchased under the buyback program in the fourth quarter were purchased pursuant to the terms of a pre-arranged trading plan established in accordance with Rule 10b5-1. The share buyback authorization remains in place, however, the company has stopped purchasing shares in the near-term and is focused on paying down debt. 44 Table of Contents ITEM 6. SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA On July 12, 2007, CBOT Holdings, Inc. (CBOT Holdings) merged with and into Chicago Mercantile Exchange Holdings Inc. (CME Holdings). At the time of this merger, the combined company was renamed CME Group Inc. (CME Group). On March 23, 2008, CME Group acquired Credit Market Analysis Ltd., a private company incorporated in the United Kingdom, and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (collectively, CMA).

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS INTRODUCTION Our Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is organized as follows: • Overview: Includes a discussion of our business structure; current economic and industry-wide trends relevant to our business; our current business strategy; and our primary sources of operating and non-operating revenues and expenditures. • Critical Accounting Policies: Provides an explanation of accounting policies which may have a significant impact on our financial results and the estimates, assumptions and risks associated with those policies. • Recent Accounting Pronouncements: Includes an evaluation of recent accounting pronouncements and the potential impact of their future adoption on our financial results. • Results of Operations: Includes a discussion of our 2008, 2007 and 2006 financial results and any known events or trends which are likely to impact future results. • Liquidity and Capital Resources: Includes a discussion of our future cash requirements, capital resources, significant planned expenditures and financing arrangements. On July 12, 2007, CBOT Holdings, Inc. (CBOT Holdings) merged with and into Chicago Mercantile Exchange Holdings Inc. (CME Holdings). At the time of this merger, the combined company was renamed CME Group Inc. (CME Group). On March 23, 2008, CME Group acquired Credit Market Analysis Ltd., a private company incorporated in the United Kingdom, and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (collectively, CMA). On August 22, 2008, NYMEX Holdings, Inc. (NYMEX Holdings) merged with CME Group. The following Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations includes the financial results of CBOT Holdings beginning July 13, 2007, the financial results of CMA beginning on March 24, 2008, and the financial results of NYMEX Holdings beginning August 23, 2008. References in this discussion and analysis to “we” and “our” are to CME Group and its consolidated subsidiaries, collectively. References to “exchange” are to Chicago Mercantile Exchange Inc. (CME), Board of Trade of the City of Chicago, Inc. (CBOT) and New York Mercantile Exchange, Inc. (NYMEX), collectively. OVERVIEW Business Structure CME Group, a Delaware stock corporation, is the holding company for CME, CBOT, NYMEX and their respective subsidiaries. The holding company structure is designed to provide strategic and operational flexibility. CME Group’s Class A common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market (NASDAQ) under the ticker symbol “CME.” Our exchange consists of designated contract markets for the trading of futures and options on futures contracts. Futures contracts and options on futures contracts provide investors with vehicles for protecting against, and potentially profiting from, price changes in financial instruments and physical commodities. We are a global exchange with customer access available all over the world. Our customers consist of professional traders, financial institutions, individual and institutional investors, major corporations, manufacturers, producers and governments. Customers include both members of the exchange and non-members. We offer our customers the opportunity to trade futures contracts and options on futures contracts on a range of products including those based on interest rates, equities, foreign exchange, commodities and alternative investments. Our products provide a means for hedging, speculating and allocating assets. We identify new products by monitoring economic trends and their impact on the risk management and speculative needs of our existing and prospective customers. Our major product lines are traded through our electronic trading platforms and our open outcry trading floors. These execution facilities offer our customers immediate trade execution and price transparency. In addition, trades can be executed through privately negotiated transactions that are cleared and settled through our clearing house. 46 Table of Contents Our clearing house clears, settles and guarantees every futures and options contract traded through our exchange. We also provide clearing services to the over-the-counter market through CME Clearport and have announced our intention to provide clearing services for credit default swap contracts. Our clearing house performance guarantee is an important function of our business. Because of this guarantee, our customers do not need to evaluate the credit of each potential counterparty or limit themselves to a selected set of counterparties. This flexibility increases the potential liquidity available for each trade. Additionally, the substitution of our clearing house as the counterparty to every transaction allows our customers to establish a position with one party and then to offset the position with another party. This contract offsetting process provides our customers with flexibility in establishing and adjusting positions and provides for performance bond efficiencies. To ensure performance of counterparties, we establish and monitor financial requirements for our clearing firms and mark-to-market their positions at least twice a day. We also set minimum performance bond requirements for our traded products and will set requirements for credit default swaps in the future when we begin servicing that market. In the unlikely event of a payment default by a clearing firm, we would first apply assets of that clearing firm to cover its payment obligation. These assets include security deposits, performance bonds and any other available assets, such as the proceeds from the sale of pledged Class A and Class B common stock and associated trading rights of the clearing firm at our exchange that are owned by or assigned to the clearing firm. In addition, we would make a demand for payment pursuant to any applicable guarantee provided to the exchange by the parent company of a clearing firm. Thereafter, if the payment default remains unsatisfied, we would use, in order, CME’s surplus funds, security deposits of other clearing firms and funds collected through an assessment against all other solvent clearing firms to satisfy the deficit. Industry Trends Economic Environment. Despite the economic turbulence experienced in 2007 and 2008, our markets continue to provide an effective and transparent forum for our customers to manage risk. However, ongoing instability in the financial markets, a decline in assets under management and a decrease in the availability of credit have led to a decline in trading activity in the markets in which we participate. Our goal is to continue to maintain quality product execution and service in support of our customers while they navigate through the current economic environment. Competitive Environment. Our industry is highly competitive and we expect competition to continue to intensify. We face competition in derivatives trading, transaction processing services and quotation data services. Our competitors include futures, securities options and securities exchanges; over-the-counter markets; clearing organizations; consortia formed by our members and large market participants; alternative trade execution facilities; technology firms, including market data distributors, and electronic trading system developers. Regulatory Environment. Historically, our industry has been subject to extensive regulation. Due to recent financial and economic difficulties, there have been many calls to restructure the regulation of the financial markets. The change in Presidential administrations has made it difficult to predict what a restructured regulatory framework will look like or what impact it will have on our business. Certain proposals currently under consideration by Congress may restrict trading at derivatives exchanges. To the extent the regulatory environment is less beneficial for us, our business, financial condition and operating results could be negatively impacted. Business Strategy Our current strategy seeks to capitalize on opportunities created by the increased awareness and acceptance of derivatives, increased price volatility, technological advances and the increasing need for counterparty risk mitigation and clearing services. Our strategy focuses specifically on leveraging our benchmark products, scalable infrastructure, clearing and trading technologies as well as the benefits afforded by our integrated clearing house. This strategy will enable us to continue to evolve into a more broadly diversified financial exchange that offers trading and clearing solutions across additional products and asset classes. Our strategy includes coordinated efforts to: • Grow our core business through diversification of our customer base and extension of our current product lines; • Globalize our business by targeting international customers through strategic investments and by leveraging our diverse product offerings; and • Serve the over-the-counter market via the continued development of products and services and by exploring opportunities for acquisitions, alliances and commercial agreements. 47 Table of Contents Primary Sources of Operating Revenue Clearing and transaction fees. A majority of our revenue is derived from clearing and transaction fees, which include electronic trading fees, surcharges for privately-negotiated transactions and other volume-related charges for contracts executed through our trading venues. Because clearing and transaction fees are assessed on a per-contract basis, revenues and profitability fluctuate with changes in trading volume. In addition to the industry trends noted earlier, our revenues and trading volume tend to increase during periods of economic and geopolitical uncertainty. This is because our customers seek to manage their exposure to, or speculate on, the market volatility resulting from uncertainty. However, in 2008, we believe the extreme volatility and the decoupling of related markets have reduced customers’ ability to assume and maintain positions, which has resulted in a decrease in volume. In addition, our volume can be seasonal, and historically, we have experienced higher sequential volume during the first and second quarters followed by decreases in the third and fourth quarters of the calendar year. However, these patterns may be altered by the impact of economic and political events, the launch of new products, mergers and acquisitions as well as other factors. While volume has the most significant impact on our clearing and transaction fees revenue, there are four other factors that also influence the source of revenues: • rate structure; • product mix; • trading venue; and • the percentage of trades executed by customers who are members compared with non-member customers. Rate structure. Customers benefit from volume discounts and limits on fees as part of our effort to increase liquidity in certain products. We may periodically change fees, volume discounts, limits on fees and member discounts, perhaps significantly, based on our review of operations and the business environment. As a result of their rate structure, Total Return Asset Contracts (TRAKRS), Swapstream products and auction-traded products are excluded from disclosures of trading volume and average rate per contract in this discussion and analysis. Clearing and transaction fees on these products are immaterial relative to our other products. TRAKRS are exchange-traded non-traditional futures contracts that trade electronically on the CME Globex electronic platform. Auction-traded products, which included CME economic derivatives, were previously traded on the CME Auction Markets platform through July 2007. Product mix. We offer trading of futures and options on futures contracts on a wide-ranging set of products based on interest rates, equities, foreign exchange, commodities and alternative investments. Rates are varied by product in order to optimize revenue on existing products and support introduction of new products to encourage trading volume. Trading venue. Our exchange is an international marketplace that brings together buyers and sellers mainly through our electronic trading platforms as well as through open outcry trading on our trading floors and privately negotiated transactions. Any customer guaranteed by a clearing firm is able to obtain direct access to our electronic platforms. Open outcry trading is conducted exclusively by our members, who may execute trades on behalf of customers or for themselves. Typically, customers executing trades through our electronic platforms are charged fees for using the platform in addition to the fees assessed on all transactions executed on our exchange. Customers entering into privately negotiated transactions also incur additional charges beyond the fees assessed on all transactions. Member/non-member mix. Generally, member customers are charged lower fees than our non-member customers. Holding all other factors constant, revenue decreases if the percentage of trades executed by members increases, and increases if the percentage of non-member trades increases. 48 Table of Contents Quotation data fees. We receive revenue from the dissemination of our market data to subscribers. Our market data services are provided primarily through third-party distributors. Subscribers can obtain access to real-time, delayed and end-of-day quotation, trade and summary market data for our products. Users of our basic service receive real-time quotes and pay a flat monthly fee for each screen, or device, displaying our market data. Alternatively, customers can subscribe to market data provided on a limited group of products. The fee for this service is also a flat rate per month. Pricing for our market data services is based on the value of the service provided, our cost structure for the service and the price of comparable services offered by our competitors. Increases or decreases in our quotation data fees revenue is influenced by changes in our price structure for existing market data offerings, introduction of new market data services and changes in the number of devices in use. General economic factors that affect the financial services industry, which constitutes our primary customer base, also influence revenue from our market data services. Processing services. To further diversify the range of services we offer, we have entered into clearing and transaction processing agreements with third parties. Prior to our merger with NYMEX Holdings in August 2008, we collected fees for listing energy and metal futures products on the CME Globex platform. Prior to our merger with CBOT Holdings in July 2007, we collected fees for clearing services for CBOT products. Our processing services revenues with NYMEX and CBOT ended upon the completion of our mergers with each entity. Additionally, we provided clearing and risk management services for trades executed at FXMarketSpace Limited (FXMS), our joint venture with Reuters Group PLC (Reuters), beginning in 2007 until FXMS terminated operations in the fourth quarter of 2008. We collect fees for processing trades for certain CME clearing firms that execute trades at OneChicago, LLC (OneChicago), our joint venture in single stock futures and futures on narrow-based stock indexes. Other sources. Other sources of revenue include access and communication fees and revenue from various services related to our operations. • Access and communication fees are the connectivity charges to customers of the CME Globex platform, to our market data vendors and to direct market data customers as well as charges to members and clearing firms that utilize our various telecommunications networks and communications services. Access fee revenue varies depending on the type of connection provided to customers. Revenue from communication fees is largely dependent on open outcry trading, as a significant portion relates to telecommunications on our trading floors. • Other revenues include rent charged to third party tenants as well as ancillary charges for utilities, parking and miscellaneous services provided to tenants. We maintain three commercial buildings in Chicago’s central business district. The retail and office space is rented primarily to third party tenants, including company shareholders and exchange customers. As part of our merger with NYMEX Holdings, we also acquired office space in New York City that is rented to third party tenants. All tenants pay market rates for rent. Revenues related to our real estate operations are generally affected by market rental rates, lease renewals and business conditions in the financial services industry in which most of our tenants operate. Additionally, other revenues includes fees for administrating our Interest Earnings Facility (IEF) program, trade order routing, and various services to members and clearing firms. We offer clearing firms the opportunity to invest cash performance bonds in our various IEF offerings. These clearing firms receive interest income, and we receive a fee based on total funds on deposit. In addition, other revenues include trading gains and losses generated by GFX Corporation (GFX), our wholly-owned subsidiary that trades primarily in foreign exchange futures contracts to enhance liquidity in our electronic markets for these products. 49 Table of Contents Primary Operating Expenses Most of our expenses do not vary directly with changes in our trading volume, except licensing and other fee agreements and the majority of our employee bonuses. Compensation and benefits. Compensation and benefits expense is our most significant expense and includes employee wages, bonuses, stock-based compensation, benefits and employer taxes. Changes in this expense are driven by fluctuations in the number of employees, increases in wages as a result of inflation or labor market conditions, rates for employer taxes and other cost increases affecting benefit plans. In addition, this expense is affected by the composition of our work force. The expense associated with our bonus and stock-based compensation plans can also have a significant impact on this expense category and may vary from year to year. The bonus component of our compensation and benefits expense is based on our financial performance. Under the performance criteria of our annual incentive plan, the bonus funded under the plan would be the “target” level if we achieve the cash earnings target established by the compensation committee of our board of directors. Cash earnings are defined as net income less capital expenditures and excludes tax-effected amortization of purchased intangibles, depreciation and amortization expense, tax-effected stock-based compensation expense, valuation losses on investments, tax adjustments and net interest income (expense). Under the plan, if our actual cash earnings equal 80% of the established target for a given year, the bonus will be reduced by approximately 50% of the target bonus amount. There will be no bonus if our cash earnings are less than 80% of the cash earnings target, other than for non-exempt employees who may receive a bonus under our discretionary bonus program. If our actual cash earnings equal 120% of the target or higher, the bonus is increased by approximately 50% from the targeted bonus amount, which is the maximum amount established by the compensation committee. If our performance is between the threshold performance level of 80% of the cash earnings target and the maximum performance level of 120% of the cash earnings target, the bonus will be calculated based on the level of performance achieved. The compensation committee may adjust the cash earnings calculation and the target level of performance for material, unplanned revenue, expense or capital expenditures to meet intermediate to long-term growth opportunities. The cash earnings calculation for bonus purposes excludes items as approved at the discretion of the compensation committee. Stock-based compensation is a non-cash expense related to stock options and restricted stock grants. Stock-based compensation varies depending on the quantity and fair value of options granted. Fair value is derived using the Black-Scholes model with assumptions about our dividend yield, the expected volatility of our stock price based on an analysis of implied and historical volatility, the risk-free interest rate and the expected life of the options granted. Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense results from the depreciation of long-lived assets purchased, as well as the amortization of purchased and internally developed software. This expense has increased consistently from year to year due to significant investments in technological equipment and software. As a result of our merger with CBOT Holdings, we acquired three commercial buildings. We utilize space in these buildings as offices and a trading floor. Depreciation and amortization on the building and building improvements as well as other furniture, fixtures and equipment acquired in the merger has been recorded since the merger closed on July 12, 2007. We also acquired property in our recent merger with NYMEX Holdings. Depreciation and amortization on these building and building improvements, hardware and software have been recorded since the merger closed on August 22, 2008. Amortization of purchased intangibles. This expense includes amortization of intangible assets obtained in our mergers with CBOT Holdings and NYMEX Holdings as well as other asset and business acquisitions. Intangible assets subject to amortization consist primarily of customer relationships, licensing agreements, and lease-related intangible assets. Other expenses. We incur additional ongoing expenses for communications, technology support services and various other activities necessary to support our operations. • Communications expense consists primarily of costs for network connections to our electronic trading platforms and some market data customers; telecommunications costs of our exchange; and fees paid for access to external market data. This expense is affected primarily by the growth of electronic trading, our capacity requirements and by changes in the number of telecommunications hubs and connections which allow customers outside the United States access to our electronic trading platforms directly. 50 Table of Contents • Technology support services consist of costs related to maintenance of the hardware and software required to support our technology. Our technology support services costs are driven by system capacity, functionality and redundancy requirements. • Professional fees and outside services expense includes costs of consulting services provided for major strategic and technology initiatives as well as legal and accounting fees. This expense fluctuates primarily as a result of changes in services required to complete initiatives. • Occupancy and building operations expense consists of costs related to leased and owned property including rent, maintenance, real estate taxes, utilities and other related costs. Our office space is located primarily in Chicago and New York City with smaller offices located in Washington, D.C., Houston, London, Hong Kong, Sydney, Singapore and Tokyo. Additionally, we have trading facilities in Chicago and New York City as well as data centers in various U.S. locations. • Licensing and other fee agreements expense consists primarily of license fees paid as a result of trading volume in equity index products, and royalty and broker rebates on metals and energy products, subsequent to the merger with NYMEX Holdings. This expense fluctuates with changes in equity index and ClearPort product trading volumes and fee structure changes in the agreements. • Restructuring expense consists primarily of transitional employees’ severance, retention bonuses and associated payroll taxes as well as outplacement costs and post-employment healthcare subsidies resulting from our mergers with CBOT Holdings in July 2007 and with NYMEX Holdings in August 2008. • Other expenses includes marketing-related as well as general and administrative costs. Marketing, advertising and public relations expense consists primarily of media, print and other advertising costs, as well as costs associated with our brand campaign and product promotion. Non-Operating Income and Expense Income and expenses incurred through activities outside of our core operations are considered non-operating. These activities include investments in debt and equity securities for both short-term and long-term strategic purposes and our securities lending program as well as financing activities. • Investment income represents income generated by short-term investment of excess cash, clearing firms’ cash performance bonds and security deposits; income and net realized gains and losses from our marketable securities and long-term equity method investments; gains and losses on trading securities in our non-qualified deferred compensation plans and dividend income. Investment income is influenced by the availability of funds generated by operations, market interest rates and changes in the levels of cash performance bonds deposited by clearing firms. • We use derivative financial instruments for the purpose of hedging exposures to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. Any ineffective or excluded portion of our hedges is recognized in earnings immediately. • Under the securities lending program, we lend a portion of the securities that clearing firms deposit with us and we receive collateral in the form of cash in return. The cash is invested in either bank money market mutual funds, overnight repurchase agreements, corporate debt securities or other asset-back securities to generate interest income. The balance of securities on deposit fluctuates as a result of changes in the clearing firms’ open positions and how clearing firms elect to satisfy their performance bond requirements. Securities lending interest expense represents the payment to the borrower of the security for the cash retained during the duration of the lending transaction. Net interest income from securities lending is impacted by changes in short-term interest rates and the level of demand for the securities on deposit. • Interest and other borrowing costs are associated with various short-term and long-term funding facilities. In 2007, we initiated a commercial paper program with various financial institutions to fund a tender offer to repurchase Class A common stock. In 2008, we issued short-term and long-term debt in conjunction with our merger with NYMEX Holdings. The interest rates on our debt balances are primarily fixed, but some debt-related costs fluctuate with the funding needs of our business. 51 Table of Contents • Income (expense) related to our guarantee of exercise right privileges (ERPs) is a result of our merger with CBOT Holdings. Under the terms of the merger agreement, eligible holders of Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) ERPs could elect to sell us their ERP for $250,000 per privilege. Eligible holders that did not elect to sell their ERPs are entitled to a maximum guaranteed payment of $250,000 from us upon resolution of the lawsuit between CBOT and CBOE. The balance in this account represents the change in estimated fair value of our guarantee during the period, which is based in part on the expected outcome of the litigation. • Equity in losses of unconsolidated subsidiaries includes losses from our investments in Dubai Mercantile Exchange (DME), FXMS and OneChicago. Our investment in DME was acquired with the assets of NYMEX Holdings as part of our merger in August 2008. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The notes to our consolidated financial statements include disclosure of our significant accounting policies. In establishing these policies within the framework of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, management must make certain assessments, estimates and choices that will result in the application of these principles in a manner that appropriately reflects our financial condition and results of operations. Critical accounting policies are those policies that we believe present the most complex or subjective measurements and have the most potential to affect our financial position and operating results. While all decisions regarding accounting policies are important, there are certain accounting policies that we consider to be critical. These critical policies, which are presented in detail in the notes to our consolidated financial statements, relate to valuation of financial instruments, goodwill and intangible assets, derivative investments, revenue recognition, income taxes, internal use software costs and stock-based compensation. Valuation of Financial Instruments. In January 2008, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements,” which provides guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities by defining fair value and establishing a framework for measuring fair value. SFAS No. 157 applies to all financial instruments that are measured and reported on a fair value basis. SFAS No. 157 defines “fair value” as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, or an exit price. The standard establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the observable inputs be used when available. Observable inputs are inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on market data obtained from independent sources. Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect our assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances. We have categorized our financial instruments measured at fair value into a three-level classification in accordance with SFAS No. 157. The hierarchy is categorized into three levels based on the reliability of inputs as follows: • Level 1 – Inputs are unadjusted, quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date. Assets and liabilities carried at Level 1 fair value generally include U.S. Treasury and Government agency securities, equity securities listed in active markets, and investments in publicly traded mutual funds with quoted market prices. • Level 2 – Inputs are either directly or indirectly observable and corroborated by market data or are based on quoted prices in markets that are not active. Assets and liabilities carried at Level 2 fair value generally include municipal bonds, corporate debt and certain derivatives. • Level 3 – Inputs are unobservable and reflect management’s best estimate of what market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. Generally, assets and liabilities at fair value utilizing Level 3 inputs include certain complex over-the-counter derivative contracts and certain other assets and liabilities with inputs that require management’s judgment. 52 Table of Contents To corroborate the reasonableness of our Level 3 fair value models, we have obtained valuations for Level 3 assets and liabilities from independent third parties where available. For further discussion regarding the fair value of financial assets and liabilities, see note 24 in the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements. Goodwill and Intangible Assets. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,” we review goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment on an annual basis and whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. The provisions of SFAS No. 142 require that a two-step impairment test be performed on goodwill. In the first step, the fair value of each reporting unit is compared to its carrying amount. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying amount, no impairment exists and we are not required to perform further testing. If the carrying amount exceeds its fair value, the second step must be performed to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill. If the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, then an impairment loss is recorded in an amount equal to that excess. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. Valuation techniques we use to measure fair value include the market approach and the income approach. The market approach encompasses comparable data sets within our peer group, and the income approach includes discounted cash flow measurements using a discount rate based on our market capitalization. Additionally we have used a discounted cash flow to convert future amounts to present value. Our valuation techniques could yield variable results based on changes in assumptions such as the discount rate and long-term growth rate and forecasted revenue and expense. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are assessed for impairment by comparing their fair values to their carrying values. If the carrying value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the difference. Intangible assets subject to amortization are also evaluated for impairment, when indicated by a change in circumstances, pursuant to SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.” The impairment testing requires management to estimate the fair value of the assets and record an impairment loss for the excess of the carrying value over the fair value. The estimate of the fair value of all intangible assets is generally determined on the basis of discounted future cash flows. In estimating the fair value, management must make assumptions and projections regarding such items as future cash flows, future revenues, future earnings and other factors. Such assumptions are subject to change as a result of changing economic and competitive conditions. Derivative Investments. We use derivative financial instruments for the purpose of hedging exposures to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. Derivatives are recorded at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets in accordance with SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,” as amended. SFAS No. 133 also requires that changes in our derivatives’ fair values be recognized in earnings, unless the instruments are accounted for as hedges. For a derivative designated as a fair value hedge, any gain or loss on the derivative is recognized in earnings in the period of change, to the extent the hedge is effective, together with the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the risk being hedged. We record the effective portions of our derivative financial instruments that are designated as cash flow hedges in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. When the hedged item affects earnings, the gain or loss included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) is transferred to the same line in the consolidated statements of income as the hedged item. Any ineffective or excluded portion of a hedge is recognized in earnings immediately. Any realized gains and losses from hedges are classified in the consolidated statements of income consistent with the accounting treatment of the items being hedged. Revenue Recognition. Our revenue recognition policies comply with Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101 on revenue recognition. Our revenue is derived primarily from the clearing and transaction fees we assess on each contract executed through our trading venues and cleared through our clearing house. Clearing and transaction fees are recognized as revenue when a buy and sell order are matched and when the trade is cleared. On occasion, the customer’s exchange trading privileges may not be properly entered by the clearing firm and incorrect fees are charged for the transactions in the affected accounts. When this information is corrected within the time period allowed by the exchange, a fee adjustment is provided to the clearing firm. An accrual is established for estimated fee adjustments to reflect corrections to customer exchange trading privileges. The accrual is based on the historical pattern of adjustments processed as well as specific adjustment requests. Occasionally, market data customers will pay for services in a lump sum payment. When these circumstances occur, revenue is recognized as services are provided. Income Taxes. Calculation of the income tax provision includes an estimate of the income taxes that will be paid for the current year as well as an estimate of income tax liabilities or benefits deferred into future years, as determined in accordance with SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes” and Financial Interpretation (FIN) No. 48, “Accounting for 53 Table of Contents Uncertain Tax Positions.” As required, our deferred tax assets are reviewed to determine if all assets will be realized in future periods. To the extent it is determined that some deferred tax assets may not be fully realized, the assets must be reduced by a valuation allowance. The calculation of our tax provision involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. We recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the United States and other applicable tax jurisdictions using a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold based on the technical merits of the tax position taken or expected to be taken. If payment of these amounts varies from our estimate, our income tax provision would be reduced or increased at the time that determination is made. This determination may not be known for several years. Past tax audits have not resulted in tax adjustments that would result in a material change to the income tax provision in the year the audit was completed. The effective tax rate, defined as the income tax provision as a percentage of income before income taxes, will vary from year to year based on changes to tax rates and regulations. In addition, the effective tax rate will vary with changes to income that are not subject to income tax, such as municipal interest income, and changes in expenses or losses that are not deductible, such as certain foreign net operating losses. Internal Use Software Costs. Certain costs for employees and consultants that are incurred in connection with work on development or implementation of software for our internal use are capitalized in accordance with the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement of Position (SOP) 98-1, “Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use.” Costs capitalized are for application development or implementation, as required by SOP 98-1, for software projects that will result in significant new functionality and that are generally expected to cost in excess of $0.5 million. The amount capitalized is determined based on the time spent by the individuals completing the eligible software-related activity and the compensation and benefits or consulting fees incurred for these activities. Projects are monitored during the development cycle to assure that they continue to meet the capitalization criteria of SOP 98-1 and that the project will be completed and placed in service as intended. Any previously capitalized costs are expensed at the time a decision is made to abandon a software project. Completed internal use software projects, as well as work-in-progress projects, are included as part of property in the consolidated balance sheets. Once completed, the accumulated costs for a particular software project are amortized over the anticipated life of the software, generally three years. Costs capitalized for internal use software will vary from year to year based on our technology-related business requirements. Stock-Based Compensation. We expense stock options using the fair value method under the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R), “Share-Based Payment.” We have elected the accelerated method for recognizing the expense related to stock grants. Due to this election and the vesting provisions of our stock grants, a greater percentage of the total expense is recognized in the first and second years of the vesting period than would be recorded if we used the straight-line method. We include an estimate of expected forfeitures of stock grants in our expense recognition calculations. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS SFAS No. 141(R), “Business Combinations,” was issued in December 2007 to replace SFAS No. 141, “Business Combinations.” SFAS No. 141(R) requires that an acquirer recognize the assets acquired, the liabilities assumed and any non-controlling interest in the acquiree at the acquisition date, measured at their fair values as of that date. This new statement also changes the requirements for recognizing assets acquired and liabilities assumed arising from contingencies, restructuring liabilities and acquisition costs. Under the new requirements, acquisition-related costs will be expensed in the periods in which the costs are incurred instead of being capitalized as part of the purchase price. The provisions of this statement are applied prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2008. We are currently assessing the impact of this standard’s adoption on our financial statements. In March 2008, SFAS No. 161, “Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” was issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). The statement requires entities to enhance disclosures about its derivative and hedging activities in order to improve the transparency of financial reporting. Entities will be required to provide enhanced disclosures about how and why they use derivative instruments, how derivative instruments are accounted for under SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” and how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect their financial position, financial performance and cash flows. This statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after November 15, 2008. We will make the required disclosures upon adoption. 54 Table of Contents In June 2008, FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) Emerging Issue Task Force No. 03-6, “Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share-Based Payment Transactions are Participating Securities.” FSP No. 03-6 clarifies the treatment of unvested equity awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents in calculating earnings per share under SFAS No. 128, “Earnings Per Share.” This position is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008 and interim periods within those years. We are currently assessing the impact of this standard’s future adoption on our consolidated financial reporting. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Financial Highlights The comparability of our operating results for 2006, 2007 and 2008 is significantly impacted by our mergers with CBOT Holdings and NYMEX Holdings in July 2007 and August 2008, respectively. In the discussion and analysis that follows, we have quantified the incremental revenue or expense resulting from these transactions wherever such amounts were material and identifiable. While identified amounts may provide indications of general trends, the analysis cannot completely address the effects attributable to integration efforts. The following summarizes significant changes in our financial performance for the periods presented. Year-over-Year Change (dollars in millions) 2008 2007 2006 2008-2007 2007-2006 Total operating revenues $ 2,561.0 $ 1,756.1 $ 1,089.9 46 % 61 % Total operating expenses 978.8 704.2 468.5 39 50 Operating margin 62 % 60 % 57 % Non-operating income (expense) $ (334.2 ) $ 43.9 $ 50.2 n.m.

These increases were partially offset by a decline in processing services revenues. • Total expenses increased driven mostly by a rise in compensation and benefits costs, incremental amortization of purchased intangibles as well as depreciation and amortization. • In 2008, we recorded a $274.5 million non-cash impairment charge on our investment in BM&F Bovespa S.A. (BM&F) along with smaller impairments of our equity method investment in FXMS and certain securities lending assets which led to a decline in net non-operating income from prior years. A decline in market interest rates which reduced investment income contributed to the decrease in 2007. • Our effective tax rate increased in 2008 due primarily to an increase in our state and local tax rates as a result of our merger with NYMEX Holdings. This increase was partially offset by the impact of an Illinois tax law change in the first quarter of 2008. • The trend in diluted earnings per share reflects the impact of common stock issuances made in conjunction with the CBOT Holdings and NYMEX Holdings mergers. • The positive trend in operating cash flows from 2006 through 2008 is primarily the result of year-over-year increases in trading volumes combined with the scalable nature of our cost structure. 55 Table of Contents Operating Revenues Year-over-Year Change (dollars in millions) 2008 2007 2006 2008 - 2007 2007 - 2006 Clearing and transactions fees $ 2,115.4 $ 1,427.3 $ 866.1 48 % 65 % Quotation data fees 279.5 145.1 80.8 93 79 Processing services 54.1 106.4 90.2 (49 ) 18 Access and communication fees 43.6 36.5 29.0 19 26 Other 68.4 40.8 23.8 68 71 Total Revenues $ 2,561.0 $ 1,756.1 $ 1,089.9 46 % 61 % Clearing and Transaction Fees. From 2006 through 2008, revenues have increased primarily as a result of incremental trading volume generated from our mergers with CBOT and NYMEX. Organic volume growth also contributed to an increase in revenue from 2006 to 2007. The average rate per contract increased from 2007 to 2008 while declining from 2006 to 2007. Trading Volume The following table summarizes average daily trading volume. For comparative purposes, CME, CBOT and NYMEX products have been presented separately. For 2007 CBOT volume information, average daily volumes have been calculated for the period from July 13 through December 31, 2007. The NYMEX trading volume has been calculated for the period August 23 through December 31, 2008. All amounts exclude TRAKRS, Swapstream and auction-traded products.

In addition, there was also a significant surge in overall market volatility in the second half of 2007 through 2008, which contributed to the overall increase in volume, specifically within equity products. We believe the increase in market volatility is largely due to concerns surrounding the subprime debt market which evolved into a credit crisis in 2008. In the discussion of volume that follows, NYMEX volume information for the periods prior to August 23, 2008 is provided for comparative purposes only and does not correspond to revenue recognized by CME Group prior to that date. CBOT volume information for periods prior to July 13, 2007 is also provided for comparative purposes only. Interest Rate Products In 2008, the overall decline in interest rate volume was due largely to the global credit crisis. We believe the credit crisis has led to firm deleveraging, industry consolidation, increased risk aversion, reduced debt issuance and has distorted historical relationships between fixed income and interest rate derivative securities. The decrease in Eurodollar options is the primary driver for the overall decrease in CME interest rate volume. Eurodollar options, which are primarily traded through open outcry, decreased by 27% to an average of 0.9 million contracts per day in 2008 when compared with 2007. Average daily volume for Eurodollar futures contracts decreased by 4% to 2.4 million contracts in 2008 when compared with 2007. We believe extreme volatility and the decoupling of related markets have reduced certain customers’ ability to assume and maintain positions, which has resulted in a decrease in volume. The increase in market volatility is believed to have been generated from uncertainty regarding interest rate expectations as a result of the credit crisis. Eurodollar option volume levels are more sensitive to volatility compared with Eurodollar futures contracts. Average daily volume for the 10-Year U.S. Treasury note futures and options was 1.2 million during 2008 and 1.7 million during the period July 13 through December 31, 2007. Volume for the 5-Year U.S. Treasury note futures and options averaged 0.7 million contracts per day during 2008 and 0.8 million contracts per day for the period July 13 through December 31, 2007. We believe the credit crisis contributed to some fixed income market participants shifting from long-term debt to short-term debt, which led to a decrease in volume for products on the long end of the yield curve relative to products on the short end of the yield curve. The increase in interest rate trading volume in 2007 when compared with 2006 is due primarily to the addition of the CBOT interest rate products subsequent to the merger. Overall trading volume growth for interest rate products also resulted from uncertainty regarding inflation and market interest rates as well as concerns about the sub-prime debt market. Eurodollar futures traded electronically increased to an average of 2.2 million contracts per day in 2007, an increase of 30% when compared with 2006. Additionally, volume for Eurodollar options traded via open outcry increased 14% to an average of 1.1 million contracts per day in 2007. Equity Products There has been significant volatility in the equity markets in the second half of 2007 through 2008, which we believe is attributable to concerns regarding the subprime debt market and inflation in late 2007 that evolved into a recession, which resulted in escalating volatility throughout the period. Average volatility, as measured by the CBOE Volatility Index, increased by 86% in 2008 when compared with 2007. Average volatility increased by 77% in the last six months of 2007 when compared with the same period in 2006. We believe this increase in volatility is the primary reason for the growth in our equity trading volume during 2008 and 2007. Average daily volume for our E-mini equity products increased by 37% to 3.3 million contracts in 2008 when compared with 2007. This increase includes growth in E-mini S&P 500 futures and options contracts, which grew by 52% to an average of 2.6 million contracts per day when compared with 2007. Trading volume for E-mini equity products increased by 50% to 2.4 million contracts per day in 2007 compared with 2006 with E-mini S&P 500 futures and options contracts increasing 60% to 1.7 million contracts. Our license to list Russell-based contracts terminated in September 2008 when the last contract expired. Average daily volume for the Russell-based contracts was 261,000, 252,000 and 173,000 contracts per day for January 1 through September 22, 2008 and for the years 2007 and 2006, respectively. 57 Table of Contents Foreign Exchange Trading volume for foreign exchange products increased in 2008 when compared with 2007 due largely to increased volatility of the U.S. dollar relative to other major currencies, particularly the euro and Japanese yen. The average daily volume for euro products increased by 26% to 223,000 contracts. The Japanese yen products increased 6% to an average of 133,000 contracts per day during 2008. In 2008, electronically-traded foreign exchange volume was 95% of total foreign exchange volume compared with 92% in 2007 and 88% in 2006. The increase in trading of foreign exchange products in 2007 when compared with 2006 was fueled in part by the decline of the U.S. dollar relative to the Japanese yen, the euro and the British pound. We believe that market reaction to events in the fixed income market also contributed to volume growth during 2007. Commodity and Alternative Investment Products The increase in overall commodities trading volume in 2008 when compared with 2007 is primarily attributable to the addition of the NYMEX products to our existing product lines. NYMEX products consist mainly of energy futures and options as well as futures and options on precious and base metals. Average daily trading volume for NYMEX products increased 19% to 1.7 million contracts per day during 2008 when compared with 2007. NYMEX contracts traded electronically increased 37% to an average of 1.0 million contracts per day during 2008 when compared with 2007. Trading volume for over-the-counter products increased by 39% to an average of 468,000 contracts per day in 2008. In addition, the increase in CBOT corn and soybean products also contributed to an increase in overall commodities trading volume in 2008. During 2008, volume for basic corn products increased by 17% to an average of 320,000 contracts per day. Average daily volume for basic soybean products grew by 16% to 183,000 contracts per day during 2008. We believe that the increases in volume are due primarily to changes in global supply and demand resulting in increased volatility as well as increased use of commodities as an asset class. On September 5, 2008, CME Group completed the sale of CBOT metals trading products, including open interest. Average volume for these metals products was 23,000 contracts per day in 2008 through the date of the sale. From 2006 to 2007, trading volume grew primarily due to the volume generated, subsequent to the merger, by the addition of CBOT commodities products. Average Rate per Contract In 2008, the increase in the average rate per contract also contributed to an increase in overall revenue when compared with 2007. In 2007, the average rate per contract decreased when compared with 2006, which offset the overall increase in volume. For 2007, CBOT total volume and fees have been included for the period from July 13 through December 31, 2007. The NYMEX total volume and fees have been included for the period August 23 through December 31, 2008. All amounts in the following table exclude TRAKRS, Swapstream and auction-traded products. Year over Year Change 2008 2007 2006 2008 - 2007 2007 - 2006 Total Volume (in millions) 2,988.3 2,249.6 1,341.1 33 % 68 % Clearing and Transaction Fees (in millions) $ 2,114.7 $ 1,426.2 $ 864.4 48 65 Average Rate per Contract $ 0.708 $ 0.634 $ 0.645 12 (2 ) During 2008, the addition of the NYMEX products to our existing product lines was the primary contributor to an increase in the overall rate per contract as the NYMEX average rate per contract was $1.641 for the period August 23 through December 31, 2008. The increase in average rate per contract when compared with 2007 was also attributable to a lower portion of CME interest rate products as a percentage of total volume compared with CME equity products, which have a higher rate per contract. As a percentage of total volume, CME equity products trading volume increased by 9% in 2008, while CME interest rate products trading volume decreased by 10% when compared with 2007. In addition, the overall increase in the average rate per contract was partially attributable the full year impact in 2008 of the average rate per contract for the CBOT products. The average rate per contract for the CBOT products in 2008 was $0.712. 58 Table of Contents The increase in average rate per contract during 2008 was partially offset by a decrease in the average rate per contract for the E-mini S&P futures and options because incremental volume exceeded the CME Globex fee cap. The average rate per contract decreased in 2007 when compared with 2006 due primarily to growth in member trading. Member trading volume increased faster than non-member trading in 2007. We believe that higher volumes by automated trading systems, which typically receive member rates, contributed to this increase in member trading. In addition, the average rate per contract of the E-mini S&P futures and options contracts decreased due to incremental volume exceeding the CME Globex surcharge cap, resulting in a decrease in the overall average rate per contract. The decrease in average rate per contract in 2007 was partially offset by the addition of CBOT products to our existing product lines. The average rate per contract for CBOT products was $0.657 for the period July 13 through December 31, 2007. The increase in average rate per contract is attributable primarily to an increase in commodities volume, which has a higher average rate per contract, during the fourth quarter of 2007. Additionally, CME interest rate product volume decreased as a percentage of total volume compared with an increase in E-mini equity products, which have a higher rate per contract. As a percentage of total volume, E-mini equity volume increased by 5% in 2007 when compared with 2006 while interest rate product volume decreased by 4%. Concentration of Revenue We bill a substantial portion of our clearing and transaction fees to our clearing firms. The majority of clearing and transaction fees received from clearing firms represent charges for trades executed on behalf of their customers. As of December 31, 2008, we have approximately 130 clearing firms. Two firms represented 12% and 10% of our clearing and transaction fees revenue for 2008. Should a clearing firm discontinue operations, we believe the customer portion of the firm’s trading activity would likely transfer to another clearing firm of the exchange. Therefore, we do not believe a concentration would expose us to significant risk from the loss of revenue earned from a particular firm. Quotation Data Fees. The growth in revenue from 2006 through 2008 is attributable primarily to increasing device screen counts as well as annual increases in the monthly fee for basic services. The increase in basic device counts is largely due to the addition of CBOT’s existing customers to CME’s customer base subsequent to the merger in July 2007. In addition, the revenue generated from the NYMEX services subsequent to the merger also contributed to an increase in revenues in 2008. Revenue from CMA services includes fees for data services provided to CMA customers from March 24 through December 31, 2008. NYMEX services includes revenue generated from basic and other services provided to NYMEX’s existing customers from August 23 through December 31, 2008. We currently have no plans to increase the monthly fee for any of our basic services in 2009. 2008 2007 2006 Year-over-Year Change 2008-2007 2007-2006 Average estimated monthly basic device screen count 296,000 219,000 145,000 77,000 74,000 Basic device monthly fee per device $ 55.00 $ 50.00 $ 40.00 $ 5.00 $ 10.00 Estimated increase in revenue (in millions): Due to an increase in screen counts $ 46.1 $ 35.3 Due to an increase in the monthly fee per device 17.7 26.3 Data feed surcharges 10.1 1.0 CME and CBOT services 73.9 62.6 NYMEX services 40.1 — CMA services 10.3 — Data feed surcharges are charges billed primarily to quote vendors for access to various data feeds. In 2008, we also recognized additional revenue of $4.4 million related to audits of customer-reported device counts, which represents revenue that would have otherwise been recognized in prior periods. 59 Table of Contents The two largest resellers of our market data generated approximately 56%, 67% and 55% of our quotation data fees in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. However, we consider exposure to significant risk of revenue loss to be minimal despite this concentration. In the event that one of these vendors no longer subscribes to our market data, we believe the majority of that vendor’s customers would likely subscribe to our market data through another reseller. Additionally, several of our largest institutional customers that utilize services from the two largest quote vendors report usage and remit payment for exchange market data fees directly to us. Processing Services. The decrease in revenues in 2008 when compared with 2007 is largely attributable to the termination of our prior service agreements with CBOT Holdings and NYMEX Holdings as a result of the mergers. Our clearing agreement with CBOT Holdings, which was terminated on July 12, 2007, resulted in a decrease of $48.2 million in 2008. Fees generated from our trade matching agreement with NYMEX Holdings, which was terminated on August 22, 2008, decreased by $10.7 million when compared with 2007. Additionally, the operations of FXMS terminated in the fourth quarter of 2008. Consequently, we recognized incremental revenues of $6.4 million for upfront fees paid by FXMS for clearing and trade matching services which would have been provided by CME through January 2012. Revenues grew in 2007 when compared with 2006 due primarily to an increase in NYMEX volume. Revenues generated from trade matching services provided to NYMEX, which began at the end of the second quarter of 2006, increased by $42.1 million in 2007 when compared with 2006. The total volume of NYMEX products available on the CME Globex platform increased to 191.5 million in 2007 from 35.6 million contracts in 2006. The increase in 2007 was partially offset by a decrease in revenue resulting from the elimination of fees generated by the clearing agreement with CBOT. The decrease in processing services revenue resulting from this termination was $27.6 million in 2007 when compared with 2006. Access and Communication Fees. The revenue growth from 2006 through 2008 is primarily attributable to the telecommunication services provided to CBOT customers subsequent to the merger with CBOT Holdings in July 2007. In addition, the ongoing upgrade of customer bandwidth connections and expansion of our co-location program also contributed to growth in revenue year-over-year throughout the period. Incremental revenue resulting from our merger with NYMEX Holdings was not material in 2008. Other Revenues. The increase in revenues over the periods presented is due largely to the rental income and related revenues generated from the building operations acquired as a result our mergers with CBOT Holdings and NYMEX Holdings. Rental income and associated revenues from CBOT Holdings’ building operations totaled $25.2 million in 2008 and $11.2 million in 2007. NYMEX Holdings’ operations contributed incremental revenues of $4.4 million for the period August 23 through December 31, 2008. The other revenues for the NYMEX Holdings’ building operations primarily include rental income. The Interest Earning Facility programs generated incremental revenues of $3.4 million in 2008 when compared with 2007 due to an increase in the average funds invested by our clearing firm members in these programs. Additionally, GFX trading gains increased by $1.5 million and $2.6 million in 2008 and 2007, respectively, when compared with the prior years. 60 Table of Contents Operating Expenses 2008 2007 2006 Year-over-Year Change (dollars in millions) 2008-2007 2007-2006 Compensation and benefits $ 317.6 $ 263.3 $ 203.0 21 % 30 % Communications 52.3 43.5 31.6 20 38 Technology support services 59.6 50.5 31.2 18 62 Professional fees and outside services 71.9 53.1 33.2 35 60 Amortization of purchased intangibles 98.7 33.9 1.3 n.m. n.m.

Annual increases in compensation and benefits expense consisted primarily of the following: Year-over-Year Change (in millions) 2008-2007 2007-2006 Average headcount $ 45.5 $ 37.2 Stock-based compensation 14.7 6.5 Change in average salaries, benefits and employer taxes 7.3 3.8 Bonus (6.9 ) 11.9 Non-qualified deferred compensation plan (10.4 ) 0.3 • Average headcount increased by 22% or about 380 employees in 2008 and 23% or about 320 employees in 2007. The increases resulted from the addition of approximately 400 employees in our merger with NYMEX Holdings and approximately 690 employees in our merger with CBOT Holdings, the impacts of which were partially offset by a restructuring program initiated in July 2007. Additionally, headcount increased by 50 employees as a result of the CMA acquisition in March 2008. As of December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, we had approximately 2,300, 1,970 and 1,430 employees, respectively. • Stock-based compensation increased in 2008 due primarily to the accelerated vesting of stock options previously granted to NYMEX Holdings’ employees and the full impact of the expense related to the June 2007 grant. In 2007, stock-based compensation increased due to the full impact of the expense related to the options granted in June 2006 and additional expense related to the June 2007 grant. In addition, we recognized additional expense for the unvested stock options previously granted to CBOT Holdings’ employees. • The increase in average salaries, benefits and employer taxes in 2008 and 2007 is attributable primarily to salary increases and rising healthcare costs. • Bonus expense accrued under the provisions of our annual incentive plan decreased in 2008 due primarily to a decline in performance relative to our cash earnings target for the same period in 2007. Bonus expense increased in 2007 mostly as a result of a larger target pool due to growth in headcount when compared to 2006, improved performance of our company when compared with the cash earnings target and increased salary levels. • In 2008, increases were also partially offset by a reduction in our non-qualified deferred compensation plan liability, the impact of which does not affect net income because of an equal and offsetting change in investment income. 61 Table of Contents Communications. Expense increased from 2006 through 2008 due primarily to the costs incurred to support metals products on e-CBOT and to provide ongoing customer connectivity. Continued growth in existing customer and data center connections and bandwidth upgrades also contributed to an increase in expense in 2007 when compared with 2006. The addition of the NYMEX trading operations in August 2008 did not have a material impact on expense in 2008. We expect a reduction in communication expense relative to current levels due to improved wide area network efficiencies and the sale of the CBOT metals trading products. Technology Support Services. The increase in expense in 2008 is due to increases in software and hardware maintenance contracts, including the maintenance and support of the e-CBOT electronic trading platform, and increases in software. In 2007, there was an increase of approximately $15.1 million due primarily to the integration and support of the e-CBOT electronic trading platform. Additional investments in technology, including an upgrade to our network and mainframe system in 2006, led to increased maintenance costs as part of a planned system expansion to increase capacity for peak volumes of transactions processed electronically. Professional Fees and Outside Services. The increases in technology-related and other professional fees, net of amounts capitalized for internally developed software from 2006 through 2008 were due primarily to consulting services used to supplement our merger integration efforts as well as non-capitalizable software development costs and expenses incurred to support our strategic initiatives. Temporary staffing and consulting services also contributed to the increase in 2008 due to infrastructure development, production support and various strategic initiatives. Legal fees increased in 2008 due to class action lawsuits filed as a result of the NYMEX Holdings merger. The increase in legal fees in 2007 was due to litigation costs related to the LAMPERS and CBOE proceedings resulting from our merger with CBOT Holdings, as well as the ongoing antitrust suit filed by Eurex U.S. Amortization of Purchased Intangibles. Intangible assets subject to amortization consist primarily of clearing firm relationships, market data customer relationships, the Dow Jones licensing agreement and lease-related intangibles. Amortization of purchased intangibles in 2006 relates to intangible assets obtained as a result of our business acquisition of Swapstream and our acquisition of assets from Liquidity Direct Technology, LLC. The increase in expense from 2006 through 2008 is due primarily to intangible assets obtained in our mergers with CBOT Holdings and NYMEX Holdings, completed in July 2007 and August 2008, respectively. Depreciation and Amortization. The increase is due primarily to additional assets obtained in our mergers with CBOT Holdings and NYMEX Holdings. We have shortened the useful lives of various technology-related and trading floor assets due to consolidation of electronic trading systems and trading floor operations of CBOT. In addition, we accelerated depreciation on certain NYMEX technology-related assets through December 2009. Property additions are summarized below. Technology-related assets include purchases of computers and related equipment, software, the cost of developing internal use software and the build-out of our data centers. Total property additions increased in 2008 due to spending for the development of our new data center and the development of our Chicago office space. The decrease in technology-related assets as a percentage of total property additions is attributable to landlord tenant improvement allowances at buildings acquired in our CBOT Holdings and NYMEX Holdings mergers. 2008 2007 2006 Year-over-Year Change (dollars in millions) 2008-2007 2007-2006 Total property additions, including landlord-funded leasehold improvements $ 200.2 $ 163.7 $ 88.2 22 % 86 % Technology-related assets as a percentage of total property additions 72 % 77 % 90 % 62 Table of Contents Occupancy and Building Operations. In 2008, we acquired additional commercial real estate as part of our merger with NYMEX Holdings. Utilities, maintenance and real estate tax expense for these properties contributed to the increased expense in 2007. Rent expense also increased in 2008 due to additional office space in London, Hong Kong, India, Japan and Singapore. We also purchased a remote data center facility that resulted in an increased occupancy expense in 2008. In August 2007, we renegotiated the leases for office space and former trading floor facilities at our headquarters. Under the terms of our new lease, which extends our occupancy through 2022, we will be reducing our rented space in 2009. Licensing and Other Fee Agreements. In 2008, higher average daily trading volume for certain licensed products and additional royalty fees and broker rebates on NYMEX products contributed to additional expense when compared with 2007. In addition, licensing fees on E-mini S&P and on E-mini NASDAQ-100 products contributed to the increase in 2008. We renewed our exclusive product licensing agreement with Dow Jones in September 2007. The new agreement is effective from January 2008 through December 2014 and included an upfront payment as well as minimum annual payments. The upfront payment, which was negotiated in exchange for a reduced rate per contract, is being recognized in equal amounts each month over the term of the agreement. Higher trading volume for licensed products, particularly E-mini S&P products, resulted in an increase in expense in 2007. Also contributing to the increase were licensing and market maker fees related to CBOT products. These increases were partially offset by a reduction in costs incurred under a fee sharing agreement with Singapore Exchange Limited (SGX). Restructuring. This expense consists primarily of severance to transitional CBOT and NYMEX employees, severance to CME employees, retention bonuses and associated payroll taxes as well as outplacement costs and post-employment healthcare subsidies. The restructuring plan related to the CBOT Holdings merger, which was initiated in August 2007, was substantially complete by July 2008. Other Expenses. Other expenses increased in 2008 when compared with 2007 due primarily to an $11.9 million goodwill impairment charge related to our Swapstream operations, $6.3 million of incremental marketing and advertising activities due to the CBOT Holdings and NYMEX Holdings mergers, $3.7 million of in-process research and development costs related to our purchase of CMA, and $3.5 million in travel costs related to ongoing strategic initiatives. The increase in 2008 also reflects $3.8 million of unfavorable Brazilian currency fluctuations and a $2.3 million loss on the sale of CBOT metals trading products. The increase in 2007 is attributable primarily to $8.0 million of marketing, advertising and public relations costs incurred as part of our global band campaign and efforts to redesign and expand our customer education programs. Also contributing to the increase was $6.3 million of settlement costs related to the LAMPERS class action lawsuit. A higher level of general and administrative expenses resulting from our mergers also contributed to the increases in 2008 and 2007 expense. Non-Operating Income (Expense) 2008 2007 2006 Year-over-Year Change (dollars in millions) 2008-2007 2007-2006 Investment income $ 45.5 $ 73.2 $ 55.8 (38 )% 31 % Impairment of long-term investment (274.5 ) — — n.m. — Gains (losses) on derivative investments (8.1 ) (0.1 ) — n.m. n.m.

During 2008, investment income decreased due largely to the decline in market interest rates resulting from rate reductions by the Federal Open Market Committee during the year. The increase in investment income in 2007 when compared with 2006 was attributable primarily to the investment of additional cash generated from operations during the year as well as rising short-term interest rates. In late 2007, interest rates began to decline resulting in a decline in the investment income growth rate we had experienced earlier in the year. Annualized average rates of return and average investment balances indicated in the table below include short-term investments classified as cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and the portion of the clearing firms’ cash performance bonds and security deposits that we chose to invest. 2008 2007 2006 Year-over-Year Change (dollars in millions) 2008-2007 2007-2006 Annualized average rate of return 2.51 % 4.46 % 4.16 % (1.95 )% 0.30 % Average investment balance $ 1,498.0 $ 1,563.9 $ 1,294.1 $ (65.9 ) $ 269.8 Change in income due to balance $ (3.0 ) $ 11.3 Change in income due to rate (29.2 ) 4.7 The analysis presented in the table above does not include the income (loss) on insurance contracts and marketable securities that are related to our non-qualified deferred compensation plans of $(8.2) million, $2.2 million and $1.9 million for 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, and $13.3 million of dividend income on our investment in BM&F stock for 2008. Impairment of Long-Term Investment. All equity securities are assessed for other-than-temporary impairment on a quarterly basis, taking into consideration the magnitude and duration of the unrealized loss. As of December 31, 2008, we determined that our investment in BM&F was impaired due to an extended decline in the market price of BM&F stock. As a result, we recognized an impairment loss of $274.5 million. In February 2008, we exchanged 1.2 million shares of our Class A common stock to obtain our 101.1 million shares investment in BM&F. We are restricted from selling our BM&F shares until February 2012. Gains (Losses) on Derivative Investments. The net loss on derivative contracts is due primarily to the change in fair value of the put option contract purchased to hedge our risk of changes in the fair value of BM&F stock resulting from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and the Brazilian real. The change in fair value resulted in a loss of $5.9 million in 2008. Lehman Brothers Special Financing Inc. (LBSF) was the sole counterparty to this option contract. On September 15, 2008, Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (Lehman) filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. The bankruptcy filing of Lehman was an event of default that gave us the right to immediately terminate the put option agreement with LBSF. Under the terms of our agreement, the fair value of the put option was not required to be fully collateralized. Upon termination, we recognized a loss of $2.0 million due to the shortfall in collateralization. In addition, during 2008, we entered into three interest rate swaps to hedge our risk of changes in interest payments on floating rate debt due to changes in the underlying benchmark rate. These hedges are expected to be highly effective. To the extent that there is ineffectiveness, we record a gain or loss on derivative investments during the period incurred. The impact of recognizing ineffectiveness was not material in 2008. The financial statement impact of derivative financial instrument arrangements in effect during 2006 and 2007 was immaterial. Securities Lending Income and Expense. Our securities lending program was curtailed, and at times suspended during 2008 due to high volatility in the credit markets and extreme demand for U.S. Treasury securities. This resulted in a decline in the average daily balance of funds invested in 2008 when compared with 2007. The increase in spread between the average rate earned and the average rate paid during 2008 was due to the combination of an increase in demand for U.S. Treasury securities, which affects the rate paid, and a lag effect from changing interest rates on the reinvested cash in money market funds, which affects the rate earned. The decrease in 2008 overall revenue and expense is attributable to the decline in average funds invested as well as the Federal Open Market Committee’s interest rate reductions. 64 Table of Contents Despite a temporary suspension of the securities lending program in 2007, we were able to expand lending relationships to include additional banks resulting in an increase in the average daily balance of funds invested when compared with 2006. The spread between the average rate earned and the average rate paid increased during 2007 due to the combined effect of changes in the federal discount rate, which correlates closely with the interest expense, and an increase in market demand for the securities we had available to lend through this program 2008 2007 2006 Year-over-Year Change (dollars in billions) 2008-2007 2007-2006 Average daily balance of funds invested $ 0.9 $ 2.3 $ 1.9 $ (1.4 ) $ 0.4 Annualized average rate earned 3.40 % 5.27 % 5.01 % (1.87 )% 0.26 % Annualized average rate paid 2.77 5.03 4.91 (2.26 ) 0.12 Net earned from securities lending 0.63 % 0.24 % 0.10 % 0.39 % 0.14 % The analysis presented in the table above does not reflect: • An impairment loss of $6.0 million recognized in 2008. The loss was related to a money market mutual fund with investments in short-term corporate debt securities which are currently in default. • Securities lending activity attributable to NYMEX. Securities lending interest income, net of interest expense and bank fees, from NYMEX ongoing securities lending activities was $5.1 million for the period subsequent to the merger. We also recognized an impairment loss of $18.3 million on a corporate debt security held in the NYMEX securities lending portfolio. Interest and Other Borrowing Costs. In 2008, interest and other borrowing costs increased due largely to higher average debt levels outstanding as a result of debt issued in August 2008 in conjunction with the NYMEX Holdings merger. These borrowings consisted of commercial paper and longer-termed fixed and floating rate notes. Weighted average borrowings outstanding during 2008 were $1.3 billion. The weighted average rate and weighted average effective yield, including debt issuance costs and accretion of debt discount, was 3.66% and 4.28%, respectively, in 2008. The weighted average balance of commercial paper outstanding in 2007 was $64.2 million. The weighted average rate and weighted average effective yield was 4.95% and 4.98% for 2007, respectively. We did not have any debt outstanding during 2006. Guarantee of Exercise Right Privileges. Under the terms of our merger with CBOT Holdings, holders that did not elect to sell their ERPs to us were entitled to a minimum guaranteed payment of up to $250,000 upon resolution of the lawsuit between CBOT and CBOE. In December 2008, a settlement hearing for the ERP litigation was held. However, a final ruling has not been made. Our liability under the guarantee, which is recorded at fair value in other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets, was estimated as $1.2 million and $14.0 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The decrease in the fair value was due to a reassessment of the possible outcomes of the litigation. We will continue to adjust the fair value of the guarantee on a quarterly basis until the lawsuit is resolved. Equity in Losses of Unconsolidated Subsidiaries. The 2008 increase in this account was due primarily to our decision to terminate our investment in FXMS, our joint venture with Reuters, which was established in the second half of 2006. As a result, we wrote off $15.9 million, the full amount of our existing investment in FXMS and our portion of the remaining capital needed to wind down operations. Since forming the venture, we have recorded $30.3 million, excluding the amount written off, for our share of losses from operations related to this investment. Other Non-operating Expense. This expense is attributable primarily to transfer and other transaction fees related to our acquisition of an equity stake in BM&F in the first quarter of 2008. Income Tax Provision The effective tax rate increased to 42.7% in 2008 compared with 39.9% in 2007 and 39.4% in 2006. The increase was driven primarily by an increase in our state and local tax rate due to our merger with NYMEX Holdings in August 2008, including a charge of $48.3 million to record the impact of our new combined state and local tax rate on our existing net deferred tax liabilities. The increase in our net deferred tax liabilities was partially offset by a first quarter benefit from 65 Table of Contents an Illinois tax law change that resulted in a $38.6 million reduction in net deferred tax liabilities. In addition, our 2008 effective tax rate was unfavorably impacted by an increase in our accrual for uncertain tax positions related to state and local tax exposures, a reduced benefit as compared with the prior year related to our tax-advantaged securities and the non-deductibility of goodwill and intangible asset impairment for Swapstream that was recorded in the third quarter of 2008. The increase in the effective tax rate from 2006 to 2007 was due primarily to the inability to recognize the benefit of net operating losses generated by Swapstream’s operations. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash Requirements Until we began our commercial paper program in mid-2007, we historically met our funding requirements through operations. While our cost structure is primarily fixed in the short term, our sources of operating cash are largely dependent on trading volume levels. We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to cover our working capital needs, capital expenditures, and other commitments. However it is possible that we may need to raise additional funds to finance our activities through future public debt offerings or by borrowing money from financial institutions. Cash will also be required for operating leases and non-cancelable purchase obligations as well as commitments reflected as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2008. These commitments are as follows (in thousands): Year OperatingLeases PurchaseObligations OtherLiabilities Total (a) 2009 $ 19,351 $ 13,623 $ 1,217 $ 34,191 2010-2011 42,726 22,173 — 64,899 2012-2013 36,454 10,000 — 46,454 Thereafter 144,561 4,000 — 148,561 Total $ 243,092 $ 49,796 $ 1,217 $ 294,105 (a) Gross unrecognized tax liabilities of $28.3 million determined under FIN No. 48 are not included in the commitment table due to uncertainty about the date of their settlement. Future capital expenditures for technology are anticipated as we continue to support our growth through investment in increased system capacity and performance and through technological initiatives on our electronic trading platforms. Each year capital expenditures are incurred for improvements to and expansion of our offices, remote data centers, telecommunications capabilities and other operating equipment. We expect 2009 capital expenditures to total between $200.0 million and $225.0 million, excluding leasehold improvements for our office space that will be funded with landlord allowances. Anticipated expenditures for 2009 include approximately $75.0 million of data center build-out costs related primarily to our new data center. However, we continue to monitor capital expenditures and may revise our expected capital expenditures throughout 2009 if necessary. We intend to continue to pay a regular quarterly dividend to our shareholders. The decision to pay a dividend, however, remains within the discretion of our board of directors and may be affected by various factors, including our earnings, financial condition, capital requirements, levels of indebtedness and other considerations our board of directors deems relevant. In 2008, our dividend target remained at approximately 30% of the prior year’s cash earnings. For 2009, our annual dividend target will remain at approximately 30% of 2008 cash earnings. On February 4, 2009, the board of directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of $1.15 per share payable on March 25, 2009, to shareholders of record on March 10, 2009. Assuming no changes in the number of shares outstanding, the March 2009 dividend payment will total approximately $76.4 million. Sources and Uses of Cash Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.2 billion in 2008 compared with $814.4 million in 2007. Net cash provided by operating activities increased due primarily to increased profitability excluding impairment charges. For 2008, net cash provided by operating activities was $481.7 million higher than net income. This increase consisted primarily of an impairment charge of $274.5 million on our investment in BM&F, $137.3 million of depreciation and amortization, $98.7 million of amortization of purchased intangibles and an $81.3 million decrease in accounts receivable. Accounts 66 Table of Contents receivable in any period result primarily from the clearing and transaction fees billed in the last month of the reporting period. These were partially offset by a $115.1 million increase in deferred tax liabilities and a $101.1 million decrease in current liabilities. The increase in deferred tax liabilities was due primarily to the impact of the impairment of our investment in BM&F on our U.S. tax provision. The increase in other current liabilities is due primarily to an increase in interest payable related to an increase in debt levels as well an increase in accrued restructuring related to our merger with NYMEX Holdings. Cash used in investing activities was $3.7 billion in 2008 compared with $78.6 million in 2007. The increase in cash used in 2008 when compared with 2007 is due primarily to cash paid to shareholders in our merger with NYMEX Holdings of $2.8 billion, net of cash received and a payment of $612.0 million for the purchase of certain NYMEX membership rights in conjunction with the merger. Cash provided by financing activities was $2.0 billion in 2008 compared with cash used in financing activities of $859.9 million in 2007. The increase in cash provided relative to the prior year was due primarily to proceeds from debt issuances net of maturities of $1.6 billion and an increase in proceeds from our commercial paper program net of maturities of $1.2 billion. The increase in debt issuance during 2008 was primarily attributable to the merger with NYMEX Holdings. Debt Instruments On August 12, 2008, CME Group completed a public debt offering of $1.3 billion, including $250.0 million of floating rate notes due in 2009, $300.0 million of floating rate notes due in 2010 and $750.0 million 5.40% fixed rate notes due in 2013. The floating rate notes due in 2009 and 2010 accrue interest at the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus 0.20% and LIBOR plus 0.65%, respectively. The proceeds from the debt issuance were used to finance the merger with NYMEX Holdings. On August 22, 2008, we entered into a $1.4 billion senior credit facility with various financial institutions, which includes a term loan of $420.5 million and a revolving credit facility of $995.5 million. We may, at our option, so long as we are not in default under the senior credit facility, increase the facility from time to time by an aggregate amount of up to $1.1 billion to a total of $2.1 billion of revolving loans with only the consent of the agent and the lenders providing the additional funds. Proceeds from the senior credit facility were used to pay fees and expenses and finance the merger with NYMEX Holdings, to pay fees and expenses in connection with the refinancing of existing debt of NYMEX Holdings, to finance dividends and stock repurchases, as well as to support issuances of commercial paper. In addition, we entered into a $1.3 billion 364-day revolving bridge facility with various financial institutions on August 22, 2008. The proceeds from the loan were used to finance costs associated with the merger. This facility can also serve as a back-up facility for commercial paper and can be used to finance dividends and stock repurchases. We borrowed $187.0 million against the revolving loan facility during the year and repaid the outstanding debt by the end of the year. On February 10, 2009, we completed a public debt offering of $750.0 million of 5.75% fixed rate notes due in 2014. The net proceeds from the offering were used to repay any outstanding commercial paper borrowings that were backstopped by the 364-day revolving bridge facility. The remaining net proceeds from the offering will be used for general corporate purposes. We terminated the bridge facility on February 10, 2009. After the termination of the bridge facility, we have excess borrowing capacity for general corporate purposes of approximately $0.2 billion. We maintain a 364-day revolving line of credit with a consortium of banks to be used in certain situations by our clearing house. The line of credit provides for borrowings of up to $600.0 million. This line of credit is collateralized by clearing firm security deposits held by us in the form of U.S. Treasury or agency securities, as well as security deposit funds in the IEFs and any performance bond deposits of a clearing firm that has defaulted on its obligation. The line of credit can only be drawn on to the extent it is collateralized. At December 31, 2008, security deposit collateral available was $2.1 billion. We have the option to request an increase in the line from $600.0 million to $1.0 billion with the participating banks’ approval. As of December 31, 2008, we maintained an AA long-term credit rating and an A1+ short-term credit rating with Standard & Poor’s. We maintained an Aa3 long-term credit rating and a P1 short-term credit rating with Moody’s Investor Service (Moody’s). The outlook for our ratings is considered stable by Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s. We expect to maintain an investment grade rating given our ability to pay down debt levels and refinance existing debt facilities if necessary. If our ratings are downgraded due to a change in control which results in a downgrade below investment grade, we are required to make an offer to repurchase our fixed and floating rate notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, our senior credit facility and revolving line of credit also require that we maintain a specified minimum net worth. As of December 31, 2008, we are in compliance with the various covenant requirements of all our debt facilities. 67 Table of Contents To satisfy our performance bond obligation with SGX, we pledge CME-owned U.S. Treasury securities in lieu of, or in combination with, irrevocable letters of credit. At December 31, 2008, the letters of credit totaled $33.0 million. In addition, we had pledged securities with a fair value of $283.8 million at December 31, 2008. CME also guarantees a $5.0 million standby letter of credit for GFX. The beneficiary of the letter of credit is the clearing firm that is used by GFX to execute and maintain its futures position. The letter of credit would be utilized in the event GFX defaults in meeting performance bond requirements to its clearing firm. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As of December 31, 2008, we did not have any significant off-balance sheet arrangements as defined by the regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Liquidity and Cash Management Cash and cash equivalents totaled $297.9 million at December 31, 2008 and $845.3 million at December 31, 2007. The balance retained in cash and cash equivalents is a function of anticipated or possible short-term cash needs, prevailing interest rates, our investment policy and alternative investment choices. In June 2008, we approved a repurchase of up to $1.1 billion of CME Group Class A common stock. Effective January 2009, we have temporarily suspended this program to devote our excess free cash flow to debt reduction. Our practice is to have our pension plan 100% funded at each year end on a projected benefit obligation basis, while also satisfying any minimum required contribution and obtaining the maximum tax deduction. Based on our actuarial projections, we estimate that a $5.0 million contribution in 2009 will allow us to meet our funding goal. However, the amount of the actual contribution is contingent on the actual rate of return on our plan assets during 2009. Net current deferred tax assets of $95.5 million and $18.4 million are included in other current assets at December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007, respectively. Net current deferred tax assets result primarily from unrealized losses, stock-based compensation and accrued expenses. Net long-term deferred tax liabilities were $7.7 billion and $3.8 billion at December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007, respectively. Net deferred tax liabilities are primarily the result of purchase accounting for intangible assets in our mergers with CBOT Holdings and NYMEX Holdings. We have a long-term deferred tax asset included within our domestic long-term deferred tax liability of $144.9 million for an unrealized capital loss incurred in Brazil related to our investment in BM&F. As of December 31, 2008, we do not believe that we currently meet the more-likely-than-not threshold that would allow us to fully realize the value of the unrealized capital loss. As a result, a partial valuation allowance of $24.7 million has been provided for the amount of the unrealized capital loss that exceeds potential capital gains that could be used to offset the capital loss in future periods. We also have a long-term deferred tax asset related to Brazilian taxes of $128.1 million for a net operating loss and an unrealized capital loss incurred in Brazil related to our investment in BM&F. A full valuation allowance of $128.1 million has been provided because we do not believe that we currently meet the more-likely-than-not threshold that would allow us to realize the value of the net operating loss or the unrealized capital loss in Brazil in the future. Net long-term deferred tax assets also include a $15.5 million deferred tax asset for acquired and accumulated net operating losses related to Swapstream. Since Swapstream has not yet developed a pattern of operating income, our assessment at December 31, 2008 is that we do not believe that we currently meet the more-likely-than-not threshold that would allow us to realize the value of acquired and accumulated foreign net operating losses in the future. As a result, the $15.5 million deferred tax benefit arising from these net operating losses has been fully reserved. Each clearing firm is required to deposit and maintain a specified performance bond balance, which is determined by parameters established by the risk management department of the clearing house and may fluctuate over time. Performance bond requirements can be satisfied with a variety of approved investments and cash. Cash performance bonds and security deposits are included in our consolidated balance sheets. With the exception of the portion of securities deposited that are utilized in our securities lending program, clearing firm deposits, other than those retained in the form of cash, are not included in our consolidated balance sheets. Securities lending transactions utilize a portion of the securities that clearing firms have deposited to satisfy their proprietary performance bond requirements. Securities lending activity fluctuates based on the amount of securities that clearing firms have deposited and the 68 Table of Contents demand for securities lending activity in the particular securities available to us. As a result of these factors, the balances in cash performance bonds and security deposits, as well as the balances in our securities lending program, may fluctuate significantly over time. The performance bonds and security deposits for NYMEX clearing firms have been included in total performance bonds and security deposits subsequent to the merger with NYMEX Holdings in August 2008. Cash performance bonds and security deposits and collateral from securities lending consisted of the following at December 31: (in millions) 2008 2007 Cash performance bonds $ 17,296 $ 799 Cash security deposits 152 19 Cross-margin arrangements 204 — Performance collateral for delivery 1 15 Total Cash Performance Bonds and Security Deposits 17,653 833 Collateral from securities lending activity 427 2,862 Total $ 18,080 $ 3,695 We are required under the Commodity Exchange Act to segregate cash and securities deposited by clearing firms on behalf of customers. In addition, our exchange rules require a segregation of all funds and securities deposited by clearing firms from exchange operating funds and marketable securities. As with cash performance bonds and security deposits, these balances will fluctuate due to the investment choices available to clearing firms and the change in total deposits required. Securities, at fair value, and IEF funds were deposited for the following purposes at December 31: (in millions) 2008 2007 Performance bonds $ 96,220 $ 57,166 Security deposits 1,998 1,440 Cross-margin arrangements 188 486 Performance collateral for delivery 4 50 Total $ 98,410 $ 59,142 In order to determine the fair value of financial assets and liabilities, we use the three-level framework established by SFAS No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements.” In general, we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets to determine fair values of the investments within marketable securities, securities lending collateral and other equity investments. The Level 1 investments include U.S. Treasury securities, exchange traded mutual funds, repurchase agreements and publicly traded equity securities. If quoted prices are not available to determine fair value, we use other inputs that are observable either directly or indirectly. Investments included in Level 2 consist primarily of U.S. Government agency securities, municipal bonds, asset-backed securities and certain corporate bonds. Level 3 assets include certain corporate bonds and asset-backed securities. These assets have been valued using valuation models with inputs that are both observable and unobservable. The unobservable inputs used in these models are significant to the fair value of the investments and require management’s judgment. We determine the fair value of the derivative contracts using standard valuation models that are based on market-based observable inputs including forward and spot exchange rates and interest rate curves. Level 2 derivative assets include interest rate swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts. The fair value of the liability for the guarantee of ERPs is derived using probability-weighted Black-Scholes option values for various scenarios. The liability is included in Level 3 because management uses significant unobservable inputs including probability, expected return and volatility factors to determine the fair value. Financial assets and liabilities recorded in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2008 are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the asset or liability’s fair value measurement. 69 Table of Contents Financial Instruments Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis: (in thousands) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Assets at Fair Value: Marketable securities: U.S. Treasury securities $ 284,842 $ — $ — $ 284,842 Mutual funds 17,182 — — 17,182 Municipal bonds — 5,278 — 5,278 U.S. Government agency securities — 2,751 — 2,751 Equity investments 24 — — 24 Total 302,048 8,029 — 310,077 Securities lending collateral: Corporate bonds — 400,572 — 400,572 Asset-backed securities — 6,507 1,509 8,016 Repurchase agreements 18,370 — — 18,370 Total 18,370 407,079 1,509 426,958 Equity investments 47,659 — — 47,659 Total Assets at Fair Value $ 368,077 $ 415,108 $ 1,509 $ 784,694 Liabilities at Fair Value: Interest rate swap contracts $ — $ 33,144 $ — $ 33,144 Guarantee of CBOE ERPs — — 1,159 1,159 Total Liabilities at Fair Value $ — $ 33,144 $ 1,159 $ 34,303 The following is a reconciliation of assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) during 2008.

A financial institution defaulted on its obligation to the fund in the third quarter resulting in a decline in the fund’s market value. We considered our exposure to potential loss due to the default and our ability to hold the investment in determining the fair value of the investment. As a result of the revaluation, we recorded an impairment charge of $6.0 million in securities lending interest and other costs during the year as the decline in value was determined to be other-than-temporary. This investment was transferred into Level 3 during the year because its fair value is based on management’s best estimate. 70 Table of Contents As a result of the merger with NYMEX Holdings in August 2008, we acquired the collateral portfolio for the NYMEX securities lending program. At December 31, 2008, one corporate debt security in the portfolio was determined to be other-than-temporarily impaired due to default by the issuers. We recorded an impairment charge of $18.3 million in the securities lending interest and other costs during the year. These investments are included as purchases in Level 3 as they were acquired as part of the merger. In addition, we have categorized certain asset-backed securities in the NYMEX securities lending portfolio in Level 3 because their fair value was estimated using valuation models with unobservable inputs. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are subject to various market risks, including those caused by changes in interest rates, credit, foreign currency exchange rates, and equity prices. Interest Rate Risk In conjunction with our NYMEX Holdings merger, in August 2008, we entered into multiple credit facilities. As a result, debt outstanding at December 31, 2008 consisted of fixed rate borrowings of $2.2 billion and variable rate borrowings of $1.0 billion. Commercial paper is included in fixed rate borrowings; however, because maturities for commercial paper are generally less than 90 days, it is considered subject to interest rate fluctuations. Borrowings subject to variable interest rate fluctuations were as follows as of December 31, 2008: (dollars in thousands) Balance Weighted AverageInterest Rate Commercial Paper $ 1,498,549 2.61 % Floating rate notes due August 2009 (1) 249,850 3.01 Floating rate notes due August 2010 (2) 299,520 3.46 Term loan due August 2011(3) 420,500 4.48 Total debt subject to variable interest fluctuations $ 2,468,419 (1) The 2009 notes bear interest at a floating rate equal to the three-month LIBOR plus 0.20% per year. In October 2008, we entered into an interest-rate swap agreement that modifies the variable interest obligation associated with these notes so that the interest payable on the notes effectively becomes fixed at a rate of 3.12% beginning with the interest accrued after November 6, 2008. (2) The 2010 notes bear interest at a floating rate equal to three-month LIBOR plus 0.65% per year. In September 2008, we entered into an interest-rate swap agreement that modifies the variable interest obligation associated with these notes so that the interest payable on the notes effectively becomes fixed at a rate of 3.92% beginning with the interest accrued after November 6, 2008. (3) The term loan bears interest at a floating rate equal to three-month LIBOR plus 1.00% per year. In September 2008, we entered into an interest-rate swap agreement that modifies the variable interest obligation associated with this facility so that the interest payable effectively becomes fixed at a rate of 4.72% beginning with the interest accrued after October 22, 2008. Credit Risk Our clearing house acts as the counterparty to all trades consummated on or through our exchange or on third-party exchanges for which we provide clearing services. As a result, we are exposed to significant credit risk of third parties, including our clearing firms. We are also exposed, indirectly, to the credit risk of customers of our clearing firms. These parties may default on their obligations due to bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, operational failure or other reasons. In order to ensure performance, we establish and monitor financial requirements for our clearing firms. We set minimum performance bond requirements for our traded products. We typically hold performance bond collateral to cover at least 95% of price changes for a given product within a given historical period. Our clearing house marks-to-market all open positions at least twice a day, and more often if market volatility warrants; providing both participants in a transaction with an accounting of their financial obligations under the contract. This allows our clearing house to 71 Table of Contents identify quickly any clearing firms that may not be able to satisfy the financial obligations resulting from changes in the prices of their open contracts before those financial obligations become exceptionally large and jeopardize the ability of our clearing house to ensure performance of their open positions. This transparency makes it difficult for traders to hide losses or disguise unusual profits. Although we have policies and procedures to help ensure that our clearing firms can satisfy their obligations, these policies and procedures may not succeed in detecting problems or preventing defaults. We also have in place various measures intended to enable us to cover any default and maintain liquidity. In the unlikely event of a payment default by a clearing firm, we would first apply assets of that clearing firm to cover its payment obligation. These assets include security deposits, performance bonds and any other available assets, such as the proceeds from the sale of Class A common stock and trading rights (at CME, CBOT, NYMEX and COMEX) of the clearing firm and the Class B common stock for CME clearing firms owned by or assigned to the clearing firm. In addition, we would make a demand for payment pursuant to any applicable guarantee provided to the exchange by the parent of a clearing firm. Thereafter, if the payment default remains unsatisfied, we would use our surplus funds, security deposits of other clearing firms and funds collected through an assessment against all other solvent clearing firms to satisfy the deficit. We maintain a committed $600.0 million 364-day revolving line of credit with a consortium of banks. We have the option to increase the facility from $600.0 million to $1.0 billion subject to approval by the banks providing the additional commitments. We are required to post additional collateral in connection with any such increase. This line of credit may also be utilized if there is a temporary disruption with the domestic payments system that would delay settlement payments between our clearing house and clearing firms. The credit agreement requires us to pledge clearing firm security deposits held by us in the form of U.S. Treasury or agency securities, as well as security deposit funds in our second IEF program to the line of credit custodian prior to drawing on the line. Performance bond collateral of a defaulting clearing firm may also be used to secure a draw on the line. The following shows the available assets of our clearing house at December 31, 2008 in the event of a payment default by a clearing firm: (in millions) CME Clearing HouseAvailable Assets Aggregate Performance Bond Deposits by All Clearing Firms (1) $ 116,064 CME Surplus Funds (2) 57 Security Deposits of Clearing Firms (3) 1,751 Limited Assessment Powers (4) 4,816 Minimum Total Assets Available for Default (5) $ 6,624 (1) Aggregate performance bond deposits by all clearing firms includes cash performance bond deposits of $17.3 billion and the value assigned by our exchange for securities deposited to satisfy performance bond requirements. This assigned value for securities is generally less than the market value of the securities deposited. In the event of a default, we also have the ability to use the membership shares pledged by members. (2) CME surplus funds represent the amount of CME’s working capital reduced by an amount necessary to support CME’s short-term operations. (3) Security deposits of clearing firms include security deposits required of clearing firms, but do not include any excess deposits held by our exchange at the direction of the clearing firms. (4) In the event of a clearing firm default, if a loss continues to exist after the utilization of the assets of the defaulted firm, our surplus funds and the security deposits of non-defaulting firms, we have the right to assess all non-defaulting clearing members up to 2.75 times their existing security deposit requirements. (5) Represents the aggregate minimum resources available to satisfy any obligations not met by a defaulting firm able to clear CME, CBOT and NYMEX products subsequent to the liquidation of the defaulting firm’s performance bond collateral. Despite these safeguards, we cannot assure you that these measures will be sufficient to protect us from a default or that we will not be materially and adversely affected in the event of a significant default. 72 Table of Contents Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk Although our foreign operations have expanded as a result of recent business combinations, our exposure to foreign exchange rate risk resulting from ongoing foreign operations is not expected to be material to our financial condition or operating results. We are also exposed to foreign exchange rate risk related to the equity investments noted under Equity Price Risk. Any foreign currency rate risk related to these investments is reflected in the unrealized loss presented in the table below. Equity Price Risk We hold certain investments in equity securities for strategic purposes. Investments subject to equity price risks are generally recorded as available for sale at their fair value. Equity securities whose sale is restricted for greater than 12 months are carried at original cost, net of impairment charges, until the restriction is within 12 months of expiration at which time they are recorded at fair value. Fair values are based on quoted market prices or management’s estimates of fair value as of the balance sheet dates. Fair values are subject to fluctuation and, consequently, the amount realized in the subsequent sale of an investment may differ significantly from its current reported value. Fluctuation in the market price of a security may result from perceived changes in the underlying economic characteristics of the issuer, the relative price of alternative investments and general market conditions. The table below summarizes our publicly-traded equity investments at December 31, 2008. Equity investments are included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets. (in millions) OriginalCost FairValue CarryingValue UnrealizedLoss,Net of Tax BM&F BOVESPA S.A. (1) (2) $ 631,394 $ 262,905 $ 262,905 $ — TSX Group Inc.

On September 15, 2008, the counterparty to this option contract was in default and the option contract was terminated. We have not re-established the hedge as of this time. (2) In February 2008, we exchanged 1.2 million shares of Class A common stock for 101.1 million shares in BM&F. The company may not sell its shares in BM&F for four years after the purchase date. As a result, BM&F stock is reported in other assets at original cost less impairment loss until within 12 months of the restriction lapsing, after which time the stock will be accounted for as an available-for-sale security. (3) This investment was acquired in August 2008 as part of our merger with NYMEX Holdings. We do not currently hedge against equity price risk. All equity securities are assessed for other-than-temporary impairment on a quarterly basis. An assessment of whether a security is other-than-temporarily impaired takes into consideration the magnitude and duration of the unrealized loss. At December 31, 2008, we determined that our investment in BM&F was impaired. We recorded impairment of $368.4 million, of which $274.5 million was recognized as an impairment loss in 2008 earnings. The remaining $93.9 million of impairment, which is related to changes in the foreign currency exchange rate, was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). We determined that our other equity investments were not impaired at December 31, 2008. 73 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 20:16:42.770615

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” page 55, for the average daily volume of contracts traded in our principal product lines for the last three years. Interest Rate Products. Our interest rate products enable banks and other financial institutions worldwide to hedge interest rate risks, and in turn help to reduce the overall cost of borrowing and financing. Our interest rate products allow our customers to execute transactions across the entire U.S. dollar-denominated yield curve using some of the world’s most actively traded futures and options products. Customers may manage short-, medium- and long-term interest rate risk using our products based on Eurodollars, U.S. Treasuries, swaps and other dollar-related instruments. In 2009, we extended our relationship with the British Banker’s Association with a long-term agreement for our use of its London Interbank Offered Rate to settle various interest rate products, including our benchmark Eurodollar contract. As a result of our acquisition of CBOT, our interest rate products include CBOT’s thirty-year U.S. Treasury bond futures and options on futures; ten-year, five-year and two-year U.S. Treasury note futures and options; interest rate swap futures and options; and federal funds futures and options. In 2009, we launched three-year Treasury note futures. In January 2010, we launched our Ultra T-bond futures contract. To date, this is the most successful new interest rate product launch in our history in terms of volume and open interest growth since launch. Forty-two percent of our overall annual trading volume in 2009 and 26% of our clearing and transaction fees was based upon our interest rate products. In 2009, we experienced an overall decline in interest rate volume due largely to the credit crisis and the Federal Reserve Bank’s zero interest rate policy for short-term interest rates. Several macroeconomic factors that drive interest rates have begun to stabilize over the course of the year, including improvements in liquidity and credit spreads, but areas of weakness remain. In 2010, we plan to continue our efforts to expand our customer base and increase international participation through additional marketing efforts and educational programs. We will also look to expand our benchmark products. 10 Equity Products. Our equity products permit investors to obtain exposure, for hedging or speculative purposes, to changes in the weighting of one or more equity market sectors more efficiently than by buying or selling the underlying securities. By allowing investors to effectively manage stock market risks, our equity products increase investor confidence and overall participation in these important markets. We are a leading equity index marketplace, offering futures and options products (including our E-mini contracts) on key benchmark equity indexes covering small-, medium- and large-cap companies in the U.S., Europe and Asia. These include the Standard & Poor’s, Dow Jones, NASDAQ, Nikkei, MSCI and FTSE/Xinhua indexes, and others. We have exclusive licensing arrangements with Standard & Poor’s Corporation (S&P), NASDAQ OMX Group, Inc. (NASDAQ OMX) and Dow Jones & Company, Inc. (Dow Jones), which allow us to offer futures and options on futures on their indexes, including our contracts based on the S&P 500 Index, the NASDAQ-100 Index and the Dow Jones Industrial Average. As previously discussed, we have also entered into a definitive agreement with Dow Jones to create a joint venture which will create new opportunities for growing our index business. For a detailed description of these licensing arrangements, see the section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K entitled “Item 1. Business—Licensing Agreements.” Trading in our equity products represented 28% of our total trading volume and 24% of our clearing and transaction fees during 2009. We believe our leading market position in equity products is a result of the liquidity of our markets, the status of the S&P 500, the NASDAQ-100 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average indexes as the principal U.S. financial standards for benchmarking stock market returns, and the appeal to investors and traders of our E-mini products and other equity products and our CME Globex platform. These investors include public and private pension funds, investment companies, mutual funds, insurance companies and other financial services companies that benchmark their investment performance to different segments of the equity markets. We believe future growth in our equity products will come from continued counterparty credit concerns, continued education of our customers as to the benefits of our equity product portfolio and our trading platform to serve their risk management needs, and the benefits of futures products over cash equities. We believe that our equity volumes may continue to be impacted by and are in large part influenced by the trading volume levels of the underlying markets as well as the level of market volatility. Foreign Exchange Products. We became the first exchange to introduce financial futures when we launched foreign exchange futures in 1972. Our foreign exchange market serves as an effective and efficient means of risk transfer for the global foreign exchange market, bringing together a broad array of client segments by offering investment as well as risk management opportunities. Our customers benefit from dealing anonymously in a fully transparent market, where large and small customers have equal access to the same prices and deep pool of liquidity. Our foreign exchange products provide the tools and resources to hedge foreign exchange risk, facilitating cross-border trade and commerce while mitigating the risks to profitability due to fluctuations in the foreign exchange market. Our foreign exchange market attracts both buy- and sell-side investors, including commercial and investment banks, hedge funds, commodity trading advisors, proprietary trading firms and individual investors. In 2009, we launched a series of innovative smaller-sized foreign exchange contracts, called Forex E-Micros, designed to enable retail traders and investors to cost-effectively access the security, transparency and liquidity of our products. We also added Turkish Lira futures to our foreign exchange product suite. Approximately 97% of our foreign exchange products are traded electronically on the CME Globex platform, ensuring that business is transacted quickly with maximum operational efficiency. Today, we offer approximately 40 foreign exchange futures and approximately 30 foreign exchange options on futures products, covering major as well as a broad array of emerging market currency pairs in more than 20 different currencies. In 2009, we saw an average daily volume of 624,000 foreign exchange contracts, with a notional value of $79.8 billion a day. Trading in our foreign exchange products represented 6% of our total trading volume in 2009 and 6% 11 of our clearing and transaction fees. In 2009, while the broader over-the-counter FX market volume declined by roughly 25% based on central bank turnover statistics, CME Group’s average daily volume for foreign exchange products was flat when compared with 2008. We believe this result is largely due to the breadth of our product coverage and diversity of our customer base as the global FX market was marked by extreme market volatility, changes in global interest rates and increased risk aversion by market participants resulting from the credit crisis. We believe future growth in our foreign exchange product line will come from expanding and diversifying our product suite and customer base. We continue to expand our foreign exchange options product suite to appeal to a broader array of customer segments. As we continue to expand our global footprint in the foreign exchange market, we expect increased trading volume from customers outside of the United States. We also expect an increased demand in the over-the-counter market for cleared products, which we have been targeting to serve. Commodity Products. Our commodity products help establish benchmark prices and play an important role in risk management. These products provide hedging tools for our customers who deal in tangible physical commodities, including agricultural producers of commodities and food processors. Commodity products were our only products when our exchange first opened for business. We have maintained a strong franchise in our commodity products, including futures contracts based on cattle, hogs, pork bellies, lumber, dairy products, soybeans, corn, wheat, oats and rough rice. We also added 11 agricultural swaps on CME ClearPort. Commodity products accounted for 7% of our trading volume and 10% of clearing and transaction fees during 2009. Energy Products. Following our acquisition of NYMEX and COMEX, we now offer the most extensive and liquid energy complex in the world, including Light Sweet Crude Oil (WTI), Natural Gas (Henry Hub), and electricity products. Many of our energy contracts are benchmarks that set the price for these resources worldwide. In 2009, we launched over 300 new energy products on CME ClearPort in response to customer demand stemming from counterparty credit risk concerns. Energy products accounted for 15% of our trading volume and 29% of clearing and transaction fees during 2009. Metal Products. Our metals futures markets include full-size contracts on gold, silver, platinum, palladium, copper and steel; as well as E-mini contracts for gold, silver and copper. We also extended our CME ClearPort clearing services to London gold futures. Metal products accounted for 2% of our trading volume and 5% of clearing and transaction fees during 2009. Market Data and Information Products. Our markets generate valuable information regarding prices and trading activity in our products that we believe enhances the appeal of our products. The dissemination of real-time data generates revenues and supports our customer base with timely market information. We sell our market data, which includes information about bids, offers, trades and trade size in our products, to banks, broker-dealers, pension funds, investment companies, mutual funds, insurance companies, individual investors and other financial services companies or organizations that use our markets or monitor general economic conditions. We distribute our market data over the CME market data platform directly to our electronic trading customers as part of their access to our markets and to quote vendors who consolidate our market data with that from other exchanges, other third-party data providers and news services, and then resell their consolidated data. Revenues from market data products totaled $331.1 million, or 13% of our total revenues, in 2009. Sophisticated quantitative approaches to risk management as well as customer time sensitivity have created new needs, uses and demands for trading-related data and analytics. This timely information has become even more important in light of the volatility and uncertainty in today’s markets. We continue to enhance our current market data and information product offerings by creating new value-added services to complement our market data products, including databases, analytical tools and other services to assist end-users. Our market data was significantly enhanced in 2009 with the expansion of futures market depth to include additional order information. Our real-time web-based market data application, CME E-quotes, experienced growth in subscribers in 2009 as we added NYMEX and COMEX data and as subscribers looked for a more cost-effective solution. CME DataMine, our historical market data service, continued to have strong demand from the hedge fund and algorithmic trading community to power their trading models. 12 As part of our market data and information products business, we also supply services to S&P and the Dubai Mercantile Exchange in connection with the usage reporting, contract administration and associated billing and revenue collection for the display and integration of their market data into our standard market data distribution. We are the exclusive distributor of Dow Jones Index data from our market data distribution platform. We also provide access to all prices for products listed on the Minneapolis Grain Exchange and the Kansas City Board of Trade, which are available for electronic trading on CME Globex. In 2009, we began offering real-time market data on our CME market data platform for BM&FBOVESPA as well. We believe that there will be further opportunities to continue leveraging our market data distribution capabilities with new or existing strategic partners. We believe that there has been a decline in subscriptions of market data due primarily to the consolidation of many of our customers and related headcount reductions as a result of the recent financial crisis. Based upon historical trends, we believe that real-time market data subscribers will increase again as unemployment numbers begin to improve in the financial services industry. Execution Our primary trade execution facilities consist of our CME Globex electronic trading platform and our open outcry trading floors in Chicago and New York City. These execution facilities offer our customers immediate trade execution and price transparency and are supported by substantial infrastructure and technology for order routing, trade reporting, market data dissemination and market surveillance and regulation. In addition, trades can be executed through privately negotiated transactions that are cleared and settled through our clearing house. Electronic Trading. Our CME Globex electronic trading platform maintains an electronic, centralized order book and trade execution algorithm for futures contracts and options on futures contracts and allows users to enter orders directly into the order book. In 2009, 81% of our average daily trading volume was executed electronically, compared with 80% in 2008. During 2009, approximately 72% of our clearing and transaction fees revenue was derived from electronic trading. Open Outcry Trading. We also offer our members the ability to execute transactions in an open-auction format on our trading floors—a centralized meeting place for traders and floor brokers to trade our products. Orders by market participants not physically located on the trading floor are communicated to floor brokers. Current market information and news are displayed on wallboards hung above the trading pits. In the second quarter of 2008, we integrated the CME and CBOT trading floors at one location at 141 West Jackson Boulevard in Chicago. As a result of our acquisition of NYMEX, we now operate open outcry trading in New York City at One North End Avenue. We completed the integration of the NYMEX and COMEX trading floors into one floor in the second quarter of 2009. During 2009, approximately 11% of our clearing and transaction fees revenue was derived from open outcry trading. Privately Negotiated and Over-the-Counter Transactions. In addition to offering traditional open outcry and electronic trading through the CME Globex platform, we permit qualified customers to trade our products by entering into privately negotiated transactions, which are reported and included in the market data we distribute. We also clear, settle and guarantee these transactions through our clearing house and CME ClearPort. These transactions provide our customers with the flexibility to negotiate their own prices, trade a wide array of financial and commodity products, and still take advantage of our financial safeguards. During 2009, approximately 17% of our clearing and transaction fees revenue was derived from this type of trading. Clearing We own and operate our clearing house—CME Clearing—that clears, settles and guarantees every futures and options contract traded through our exchange, in addition to over-the-counter products cleared through CME ClearPort and credit default swap contracts. Our integrated clearing function is designed to ensure the safety and 13 soundness of our markets. Ownership and control of our own clearing house also enables us to retain the revenue associated with both the trading and clearing of our products. By owning our clearing house, we control the cost structure and the technology development cycle for our clearing services. It helps us manage our new product initiatives without being dependent on an outside entity. It also benefits our customers by creating operational, risk management and product benefits. Additionally, owning our own clearing house allows us to generate additional revenue by providing clearing services to other exchanges. In 2009, our clearing house cleared an average of 10.3 million contracts daily and 2.6 billion contracts overall. As of December 31, 2009, we maintained approximately $83.7 billion in cash, investments and letters of credit related to performance bonds, security deposits and other collateral deposited by our clearing firms and, during 2009, we transferred an average of approximately $3.0 billion a day in settlement funds through our clearing system. In addition, our clearing house guarantees the performance of all our contracts with a financial safeguards package of approximately $9.3 billion (as of December 31, 2009). During 2009, we submitted an application to the Financial Services Authority to become a UK Recognised Clearing House. Based on growing demand for centrally cleared solutions in global financial markets, our efforts to launch CME Clearing Europe are intended to provide greater efficiencies to our European customer base during local market hours. The EMEA region has been a significant source of growth for our business, and we have experienced volume growth during non-U.S. trading hours. As part of our global growth strategy, CME Clearing Europe will help to extend the safety and security of central counterparty clearing to our European clients, both through our initial offering of credit default swaps clearing and additional locally relevant products we plan to offer in the future. The clearing function provides three primary benefits to our markets: a reliable credit guarantee; efficient, high-volume transaction processing; and cost and capital efficiencies. The services we provide can be broadly categorized as follows: • market protection and risk management; • transaction processing and position management; • settlement, collateral and delivery services; • cross-margining and mutual offset services; and • investment services. Market Protection and Risk Management. Our clearing house guarantee of performance is a significant attraction, and an important part of the functioning of our exchange. Central counterparty guarantee. Because of this guarantee, our customers do not need to evaluate the credit of each potential counterparty or limit themselves to a selected set of counterparties. The benefits of centralized clearing have been made even more apparent during the recent period of financial uncertainty. Although not a guarantee of future performance, in our more than 100 year history of trading, we have never had a default or a loss of customer funds resulting from the failure of a clearing firm. Performance bond requirements. Performance bonds are deposits that must be made by our clearing firms to ensure that they can cover potential losses in connection with their trading positions. Performance bonds are calculated by our Standard Portfolio Analysis of Risk (SPAN) system that is used by approximately 50 exchanges and clearing organizations around the world. SPAN evaluates overall portfolio risk by calculating the worst possible loss that a portfolio of derivative and physical instruments might reasonably incur over a specified time period (typically one trading day). This is done by computing the gains and losses that the portfolio would incur under different market conditions. Additionally, the substitution of our clearing house as the counterparty to every transaction allows our customers to establish a position with one party and then offset the position with another party. This contract offsetting process provides our customers with flexibility in establishing and adjusting positions and provides for performance bond efficiencies. 14 Twice daily mark-to-market process. At each settlement cycle, our clearing house values, at the market price prevailing at that time, or marks-to-market, all open positions and requires payments from clearing firms whose positions have lost value and makes payments to clearing firms whose positions have gained value. Our clearing house marks-to-market all open positions at least twice a day, and more often if market volatility warrants. In select circumstances where CME has introduced clearing services to newer markets, positions are market-to-market daily, with the capability to mark-to-market more frequently as market conditions warrant. Marking-to-market provides both participants in a transaction with an accounting of their financial obligations under the contract. Having a mark-to-market cycle of a minimum of two times a day helps protect the financial integrity of our clearing house, our clearing firms and market participants. This allows our clearing house to identify quickly any clearing firms that may not be able to satisfy the financial obligations resulting from changes in the prices of their open contracts before those financial obligations become exceptionally large and jeopardize the ability of our clearing house to ensure performance of their open positions. This transparency makes it difficult for traders to hide losses or disguise unusual profits. Segregation of customer funds. Regulations require our clearing firms to separately account for and segregate customers’ positions and monies from their own (requirements that also extend to CME Clearing). If a clearing firm becomes financially unstable or insolvent due to a financial issue, a customer’s funds held in such a segregated account (provided the customer is not involved in the financial issue itself) will not be subject to the clearing firm’s creditor claims. In situations where a clearing firm were to become insolvent, the customer accounts could be transferred to another clearing firm. Twenty-four hour monitoring by risk management team. In order to ensure performance, we establish and monitor financial requirements of our clearing firms. We employ more than 100 employees who use a variety of sophisticated tools to observe risk in our markets 24 hours a day, six days a week. These employees work closely with other teams across the organization in products and services, legal and market regulation as well as with our clearing firms to help our customers manage risk during periods of economic uncertainty. Multi-billion dollar safeguards package. CME Clearing’s approximately $9.3 billion financial safeguard system (as of December 31, 2009) is designed for the benefit and protection of both clearing members and their customers and is described in more detail on page 84 of “Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.” Credit default swaps margining. In connection with our provision of clearing services for the credit default swap market, we modified our framework to address the unique characteristics of these products. In addition to our traditional risk management procedures described above, we use a multi-factor model for margining designed to address the risk factors relating to these products. Transaction Processing and Position Management. Our CLEARING 21 system processes reported trades and positions on a real-time basis, providing users with instantaneous information on trades, positions and risk exposure. CLEARING 21 is able to process trades in futures and options products, securities and cash instruments. CLEARING 21 can also support complex new product types. Through CLEARING 21 user interfaces, our clearing firms can electronically manage their positions, exercise options, enter transactions related to foreign exchange deliveries, manage collateral posted to meet performance bond requirements and access all of our other online applications. Together with our order routing and trade matching services, we offer straight-through electronic processing of transactions in which an order is electronically routed, matched, cleared and made available to the clearing firm’s back-office systems for further processing. Settlement, Collateral and Delivery Services. We manage final settlement in all of our contracts, including cash settlement, physical delivery of selected commodities, and option exercises and assignments. Because some initial and maintenance performance bonds from clearing firms, as well as mark-to-market obligations on some of our contracts, are denominated in various foreign currencies, we offer multi-currency performance bond and settlement services. Generally, although most of our futures contracts are liquidated before the expiration of the contract, the underlying financial instruments or commodities for the remainder of the contracts must be delivered or cash 15 settled. We act as the delivery agent for all contracts, ensuring timely delivery by the seller of the exact quality and quantity specified in a contract and full and timely payment by the buyer. To administer its system of financial safeguards efficiently, our clearing house has developed banking relationships with a network of major U.S. banks and banking industry infrastructure providers, such as the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications. Among the key services provided to our clearing house by these banks and service providers are a variety of custody, credit and payment services that support the substantial financial commitments and processes backing the guarantee of our clearing house to market participants. Cross-Margining and Mutual Offset Services. Cross-margining arrangements reduce capital costs for clearing firms and customers. These agreements permit an individual clearing house to recognize a clearing firm’s open positions at other participating clearing houses, and clearing firms are able to offset risks of positions held at one clearing house against those held at other participating clearing houses. This arrangement reduces collateral deposits by the clearing firm. For example, our cross-margining program with the Options Clearing Corporation, which celebrated its 20th anniversary in 2009, reduced performance bond requirements for our clearing members by an average of approximately $2.2 billion per day utilized in 2009. We have implemented cross-margining arrangements with the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation. We also previously had an arrangement with LCH.Clearnet Group for positions at the London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange Limited that were cleared through LCH.Clearnet Group. This arrangement was terminated in February 2010. In addition, our mutual offset agreement with the Singapore Exchange Limited allows a clearing firm of either exchange initiating trades in certain products on either exchange to execute after-hours trades at the other exchange in those products and then transfer them back to the originating exchange. This mutual offset arrangement enables firms to execute trades at either exchange virtually 24 hours per day. Investment Services. In order to achieve collateral efficiencies for our clearing firms, we have established a number of collateral programs under the designation Interest Earning Facility. Under this program, our clearing firms may select from different programs to meet their individual needs. The programs are designed to enable our clearing firms to make optimal use of the demand deposit cash accounts and security accounts they have established to satisfy their performance bond requirements. We earn fee income in return for providing these value-added services to our clearing firms. Our clearing house launched a securities lending program in 2001 using a portion of certain securities deposited to meet the proprietary performance bond requirements of our clearing firms. Under the securities lending program, we would lend a security to a third party and receive collateral in the form of cash. The majority of the cash was then invested to generate interest income. The related interest expense represented payment to the borrower of the security for the cash collateral retained during the duration of the lending transaction. Securities on loan were marked-to-market daily and compared to collateral received. In 2008, we suspended the program due to high volatility in the credit markets. We continue to monitor the credit markets on a regular basis and may restart the program when conditions are appropriate. Technology Our operation of both electronic and open outcry trading facilities and a clearing house has influenced the design and implementation of the technologies that support our operations. Trading Technology. We have a proven track record of operating successful electronic and open outcry markets by developing and integrating multiple, evolving technologies that support a growing and substantial trading volume. The integrated suite of technologies we employ to accomplish this has been designed to support a significant expansion of our current business and provides us with an opportunity to leverage our technology base into new markets, products and services. 16 As electronic trading activity expands, we continue to provide greater match engine functionality unique to various markets, market models and product types. We have adopted a modular approach to technology development and engineered an integrated set of solutions that support multiple specialized markets. We continually monitor and upgrade our capacity requirements. Our goal is to design our systems to handle at least one-and-a-half times our historical peak transactions in our highest volume products. Significant investments in production planning, quality assurance and certification processes have enhanced our ability to expedite the delivery of the system enhancements that we develop for our customers. We continue to implement technology upgrades that provide speed and functionality enhancements. Also, our proposed transaction with BM&FBOVESPA will further expand the breadth of our technology and distribution capabilities into the global cash equities and options markets. The new platform will offer customers an integrated technology solution and we along with BM&FBOVESPA will have the ability to license the platform to other exchanges internationally. Speed, reliability, scalability, capacity and functionality are critical performance criteria for electronic trading platforms. A substantial portion of our operating budget is dedicated to system design, development and operations in order to achieve high levels of overall system performance. In 2009, we continued our efforts to grow and enhance our electronic trading capabilities. For example, we successfully deployed additional functionality which provides an easy and intuitive interface that allows our customers to quickly enter and execute complex options strategies. Additionally, in 2009, we completed the construction of our new Globex Control Center and Technology Operations Command Center. The state-of-the-art facility brings the Globex Control Center, technology operations and all our other critical support teams together in one space at 20 South Wacker Drive. Bringing these teams and functions together will ensure efficient and coordinated communications, proactive monitoring of markets and systems, and timely incident crisis management. Among its critical capabilities, the facility provides 24-hour monitoring of our global technology infrastructure and market operations; global news and market information; and geographic mapping of incoming customer calls. We also maintain remote data facilities to provide additional system capacity and redundancy for our trading and clearing technology. Our data centers support our customer interfaces, trading and execution systems, as well as clearing and settlement operations. In 2010, our production electronic trading environment will be operational in our third data center. The technology systems supporting our trading operations can be divided into five major categories: Distribution Technologies that support the ability of customers to access our trading systems from terminals through network access to our trading floor and/or electronic trading environments. Order routing/order management Technologies that control the flow of orders to the trading floor or electronic trading systems and that monitor the status of and modify submitted orders. Trade matching (electronic market) Technologies that aggregate submitted orders and electronically match buy and sell orders when their trade conditions are met. Market data Technologies that distribute order information to our end user customers on our market data platform. Trading opportunities Technologies that maximize market participants’ ability to capitalize on opportunities present in both the trading floor and electronic markets that we operate. The CME Globex electronic trading platform includes the distribution, order routing, order management, trade matching and market data technology. CME Globex’s modularity and functionality enable us to selectively add products with unique trading characteristics onto the trading platform. The distribution technologies we offer differentiate our platform and bring liquidity and trading volume to our execution facilities. As of December 31, 2009, we had approximately 900 direct connections with our systems for 17 customers across the globe. Many of these customers connect through a dedicated private network that is readily available, has wide distribution and provides fast connections in the Americas, Europe and Asia. We have telecommunications hubs in Amsterdam, Dublin, London, Milan, Paris, Sao Paulo, Seoul and Singapore to respond to customer requests and reduce the cost of trading for our foreign customers. We plan to add a hub in Kuala Lumpur in the first half of 2010. In order routing and management, we offer a range of mechanisms and were among the first U.S. derivatives exchanges to implement the FIX protocol—the standard order routing protocol used within the securities industry. In addition, our order routing and order management systems are capable of supporting multiple electronic trading match engines. This functionality gives us great latitude in the types of markets that we choose to serve. In 2009, we deployed an optimized order routing gateway that resulted in a significant reduction in CME Globex latency. We also implemented additional risk management tools for our clearing firms, including providing risk administrators with manual and automated credit controls. Several key technology platforms and standards are used to support these activities, including fault-tolerant HP Integrity NonStop Blade Systems, IBM mainframes, Hitachi and EMC storage area networks (SAN equipment), HP servers and CISCO routers and switches for hardware. Our software vendors include Oracle and DB2 databases, LINUX, UNIX, Novell, TIBCO middleware and multi-vendor network solutions. Our futures match engine design was based upon a computerized trading and match software known as the NSC system. During 2009, we continued the migration of our futures products from the NSC system to our internally designed options platform in connection with our enhancement of our options engine. Our options match engine was designed and built at CME with focus on the speed of matching buy and sell orders and fault tolerance for 24-hour trading. This transition to a single match engine will bring better system performance and more opportunity for combination futures/options trading, while allowing us to more easily and cost-effectively scale our system for future growth. All existing functionality is present and we expect that the migration will be relatively seamless to the end customer. During 2009, we completed the migration of our FX currency futures and equities complexes and expect to complete the migration of our remaining product suites by early 2011. We continue to work on enhancements to our match engine to build a fully-functional electronic marketplace for unique trading demands where our customers can offset their risk with as much ease as in our open outcry trading facilities. Over the last three years we have made significant investments in market data technologies to support increased trading and messaging volumes. Enhancements include performance improvements, scalability with a new multicast distribution platform, and a FIX 5.0 compliant messaging format. These implementations benefit our customers by reducing required bandwidth and costs as well improving performance. Clearing Technology. CLEARING 21, SPAN and CME ClearPort form the core of our clearing technology. CLEARING 21 is a system for high-volume, high-capacity clearing and settlement of exchange-based transactions. The system offers clearing firms improved efficiency and reduced costs. CLEARING 21’s modular design gives us the ability to rapidly introduce new products. The software can be customized to meet the unique needs of specialized markets. Our SPAN system is a highly sophisticated methodology that calculates performance bond requirements by analyzing the “what-ifs” of virtually any market scenario. Developed and implemented in 1988 by CME, SPAN was the first system ever to calculate performance bond requirements exclusively on the basis of overall portfolio risk at both the clearing firm and customer level. In the years since its inception, SPAN has become the industry standard for portfolio risk assessment. It is the official performance bond (margin) mechanism of approximately 50 registered exchanges, clearing organizations, service bureaus and regulatory agencies throughout the world. 18 CME ClearPort is our flexible, internet-based system that provides clearing services of over-the-counter transactions. The system lets market participants take advantage of the financial depth and security of our clearing house. Through this technology, customers can conduct their own transactions, negotiate their own prices and still take advantage of our central counterparty clearing. Building Services Following our mergers with CBOT Holdings and NYMEX Holdings, we now own and manage real estate, with approximately 1.5 million square feet of commercial space in the central business district of Chicago and approximately 500,000 square feet in downtown New York City. As of December 31, 2009, our real estate was approximately 94% occupied, with nearly 38% of the total space used by us. In the second quarter of 2009, we completed consolidation of the NYMEX and COMEX trading floors located at One North End Avenue in New York City. Tenants pay market rates for rent. The majority of tenant leases have terms of one to five years, with large tenants generally having leases for up to fifteen years. As of December 31, 2009, the largest tenant in Chicago, other than us, leased approximately 9% of the total area and the next five largest tenants leased about 14% of the total area. In New York City, the largest tenant leased approximately 12% of the total area. We manage both the real estate and the general services relating to our real estate such as cleaning, power and telephone services. Building services generated about 1% of our total revenues in 2009. Business Continuity Planning We continue to strengthen and upgrade our disaster recovery facilities and capabilities. We have dedicated significant resources to improve our continuity planning. For example, our disaster recovery infrastructure and activities include: • Formal disaster recovery testing conducted twice a year at each of our data centers. • Network disaster recovery testing conducted monthly. • Participation in an annual industry-wide disaster recovery test sponsored by the Futures Industry Association. • Bi-annual functional exercises utilizing remote access to our systems with employees responsible for our critical business unit procedures. Additionally, in order to ensure proper coordination during a potential crisis, we have established relationships with the local business community, law enforcement, and local and regional governmental emergency agencies as well as our regulators. In 2010, our production electronic trading environment will be operational in our third data center, further enhancing our disaster recovery facilities. Strategic Relationships We continually review our growth strategy and whether it is in the interests of our shareholders to engage in discussions with other parties regarding various strategic acquisitions, partnerships, divestitures and other arrangements and alliances. The following is a summary of our key strategic relationships: BM&FBOVESPA. To increase liquidity and expand the international market for our customers, we have established a partnership with BM&FBOVESPA, the leading exchange in Latin America. Pursuant to an order routing agreement, its products can be traded by participants connected to our CME Globex platform, and our products can be traded by participants connected to BM&FBOVESPA’s Global Trading System platform. We 19 currently own an equity stake of approximately 5% in BM&FBOVESPA and it owns an equity stake of approximately 1.8% in us. On February 11, 2010, we announced a non-binding letter of intent with BM&FBOVESPA to expand our existing strategic partnership to develop a new multi-asset class electronic trading platform that will be deployed by BM&FBOVESPA for use in its own cash equities and derivatives markets, and both of us will have the ability to license the platform to other exchanges internationally. The new platform will offer customers an integrated technology solution for global derivatives and non-U.S. equities trading. We have agreed to an exclusive negotiation period to enter into definitive agreements. Development of the new system will begin immediately and is expected to launch in early 2011. As part of the expanded partnership, BM&FBOVESPA will increase its ownership interest in us to 5%, the same approximate stake we currently have in BM&FBOVESPA. Consummation of the transaction is subject to the negotiation of definitive agreements, approval by the regulators, completion of customary closing conditions and BM&FBOVESPA shareholder approval. In connection with the proposed transaction, our board authorized a plan to repurchase up to 2.35 million shares of our Class A common stock. We also agreed to nominate a senior representative of BM&FBOVESPA to our board in connection with the closing of the transaction. Bursa Malaysia Derivatives. In 2009, we acquired a 25% equity stake in Bursa Malaysia Derivatives and also entered into a trade matching services agreement and a product licensing agreement. Pursuant to these agreements, we will provide CME Globex services to Bursa Malaysia for all of its derivatives products. We also will have the right to use its crude palm oil futures settlement prices to develop our own U.S. dollar denominated contract. An additional telecommunications hub is planned for Kuala Lumpur in the first half of 2010. The partnership will also further enhance our globalization efforts by facilitating our customers’ access to its important markets and will increase our presence in Asia. Dubai Mercantile Exchange. We own an approximate 28% interest in the Dubai Mercantile Exchange. In February 2009, DME futures contracts became exclusively traded electronically on our CME Globex platform. The listing of the DME Oman crude oil futures contract on CME Globex further enhances the value proposition of DME as they seek to establish Oman crude oil—which is currently used to establish the pricing of oil shipped from Oman and Dubai—as the leading world benchmark for pricing East of Suez crude oil shipments. Green Exchange Venture. Green Exchange Holdings LLC is a joint venture among CME and a consortium of banks and brokers. The Green Exchange venture plans to take over a number of products currently listed on NYMEX once it receives regulatory approval to operate as a designated contract market. Current products listed on NYMEX include futures and options on European Union Allowances, carbon allowances tied to the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, and other greenhouse gas markets. Korea Exchange. In 2008, we finalized our five-year agreement with the Korea Exchange to list the KOSPI 200 futures contract on CME Globex during after-hours trading in Korea. Trading began in November 2009. As part of the agreement, we created a telecommunications hub in Seoul. We are also committed to pursue with the Korea Exchange a potential bi-directional order routing initiative that would be modeled after our arrangement with BM&FBOVESPA. Singapore Exchange Limited. In October 2006, we renewed our mutual offset agreement with the Singapore Exchange for an additional three-year term with automatic renewals for one year each unless terminated by either party. The current term is through October 2010. This relationship, which has been in effect since 1984, allows a clearing firm of either exchange initiating trades in certain products on either exchange to execute after-hours trades at the other exchange in those products, then transfer them back to the originating exchange. As a result of our merger with CBOT Holdings, we also list the products of the Minneapolis Grain Exchange and the Kansas City Board of Trade on the CME Globex platform and act as their sole distributor of market data. 20 Marketing Programs and Advertising Our marketing programs align our core business objectives and product line goals with positioning, messaging and customer targeting strategies designed to increase awareness and use of our products and services. The marketing strategy and tactics include conducting market research to gather customer insight, and the implementation of our marketing campaigns, which may include online and print advertising, direct marketing, tradeshows and customer events, public relations, online marketing and educational programs. Our marketing programs primarily target institutional customers and, to a lesser extent, individual traders. Our marketing programs for institutional customers aim to inform traders, portfolio managers, corporate treasurers and other market professionals about new products and services, and important uses of our products, such as innovative hedging and risk management strategies. We also strive to educate these users about changes in product design, performance bond requirements and new clearing services. We participate in major domestic and international trade shows and seminars regarding futures contracts and options on futures contracts, and over-the-counter clearing solutions and other derivatives products. In addition, we sponsor educational workshops and marketing events designed to educate market users about our products. Through these relationships and programs, we attempt to understand the needs of our customer base and use information provided by them to drive our product development efforts. Our advertising strategies seek to increase awareness and strengthen perceptions of CME Group among our institutional and retail customers, as well as support an increase in our trading volume. In light of the recent financial crisis, we created an integrated and targeted marketing program to highlight the benefits of our central counterparty clearing model and our financial safeguards package. The campaign included print advertising, online marketing and educational programs. Additionally, in November 2009, we hosted our second annual Global Financial Leadership Conference, where participants had an opportunity to interact with some of the world’s leaders in business, finance and politics to discuss emerging geopolitical trends and debate critical economic issues. We were privileged to have Paul Volcker, chairman of the White House Economic Recovery Advisory Board and former chairman of the Federal Reserve, and Fareed Zakaria, editor of Newsweek International, columnist and CNN host, as our keynote speakers. Our primary method of advertising has been through print media, utilizing trade magazines and newsletters as well as business publications such as the Wall Street Journal, Financial Times and Barron’s. However, we also use online, television sponsorship and other direct advertisements to reach our target audiences. Our targeted marketing program includes corporate and product brochures designed to communicate the depth and breadth of our capabilities; our annual report to shareholders, designed to showcase how key customers globally use our products to mitigate risk, in addition to presenting an overview of our financial results; and CME Group Magazine, a quarterly publication; designed to keep our customers up to date on developments that can enhance their successful participation in the derivatives industry. The magazine features customer case histories, new product information, technology updates, trend stories and news briefs and is made available on our Web site. Competition The industry in which we operate is highly competitive and we expect competition to continue to intensify. We encounter competition in all aspects of our business, including from entities having substantially greater capital and resources and offering a wider range of products and services and some operating under a different and possibly less stringent regulatory regime. Prior to the passage of the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000 (CFMA), futures trading was required to take place on, or subject to the rules of, a federally designated contract market. The costs and difficulty of obtaining contract market designation and corresponding regulatory requirements created significant barriers to entry for competing exchanges. The passage of the CFMA and other changing market dynamics have led to increasing competition from a number of different domestic and 21 international sources of varied size, business objectives and resources. For example, the CFMA permits SEC-regulated and bank clearing organizations to clear a broad array of derivatives products in addition to the products that clearing organizations have traditionally cleared. The CFMA also permits banks and broker-dealers, and some of their affiliates, to offer and sell foreign exchange futures to retail customers without being subject to regulation under the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA). We now face competition from other futures, securities and securities option exchanges; over-the-counter markets; clearing organizations; consortia formed by our members and large market participants; alternative trade execution facilities; technology firms, including market data distributors and electronic trading system developers; and others. Competition in our Derivatives Business We believe competition among exchanges in the derivatives and securities business is based on a number of factors, including, among others: • depth and liquidity of markets; • transaction costs; • breadth of product offerings and rate and quality of new product development; • transparency, reliability and anonymity in transaction processing; • connectivity; • technological capability and innovation; • efficient and secure settlement, clearing and support services; and • reputation. We believe that we compete favorably with respect to these factors, and that our deep, liquid markets; diverse product offerings; rate and quality of new product development; and efficient, secure settlement, clearing and support services distinguish us from our competitors. We believe that in order to maintain our competitive position, we must continue to expand globally; develop new and innovative products; enhance our technology infrastructure, including its reliability and functionality; and maintain liquidity and low transaction costs. Over the past few years there have been significant changes in the industry’s landscape as a result of the wave of consolidation and increased competition. At the end of 2009, there were approximately 55 futures exchanges located in approximately 30 countries, including 7 exchanges in the United States. Additionally, there has been an increase in activity among derivative dealers, banks and other entities to form competing exchanges. In 2007, a consortium of 12 financial institutions formed an exchange, Electronic Liquidity Exchange (ELX), which began trading in July 2009. ELX’s initial product line included electronic trading in U.S. Treasury futures in the two-, five-, and ten-year notes and thirty-year bond contracts in competition with CBOT’s treasury complex. Recently, ELX requested that the CFTC compel CBOT to accept certain non-competitive trades as a means to permit two customers, with equal and opposite positions at CBOT, to transfer those positions to ELX. We believe that such transactions would violate the CEA and are prohibited by CBOT rules. At this time, the CFTC has not required us to take any action or modify our existing rules. We expect the CFTC to review the ELX request. We also face competition from IntercontinentalExchange’s (ICE) energy index, natural gas, credit default swaps, equity index, foreign exchange and other products. New entrants into our industry may increase competitive pressure on us. Because equity futures contracts are alternatives to underlying stocks and a variety of equity option and other contracts provide an alternative means of obtaining exposure to the equity markets, we also compete with NYSE Euronext and other securities and options exchanges, dealer markets and alternative trading systems in this product line, as well as with ICE in connection with its futures and options on futures contracts based on the Russell indexes. 22 We face competition from the over-the-counter market with the trading of contracts similar to those traded or cleared on our exchanges, such as swaps, forward contracts and other exchange “look-alike” contracts, in which parties directly negotiate the terms of their contracts. We also face a threat of trading volume loss if a significant number of our traditional participants decide to trade futures or similar products among themselves without using any exchange or specific trading system. The CFMA allows nearly all of our largest customers to transact futures or similar products directly with each other. While those transactions raise liquidity and credit concerns, they may be attractive based on execution costs, flexibility of terms, negotiability of margin or collateral deposits, or other considerations. Additionally, changes under the CFMA permitting the establishment of stand-alone clearing facilities for futures and over-the-counter derivatives transactions will facilitate the mitigation of credit-risk concentrations arising from such transactions. Competition in our Transaction Processing Business In addition to the competition we face in our derivatives business, we face a number of competitors in our transaction processing and other business services. In the past few years, there has been increased competition in the provision of clearing services. We compete with other derivatives exchanges that provide clearing services. ICE has its own clearing operations which are comprised of five separate regulated clearing houses across the U.S., Europe and Canada. In March 2009, ICE Trust, which provides clearing services for the credit default swap market, acquired The Clearing Corporation. Prior to its acquisition, The Clearing Corporation was one of the oldest independent clearing houses. Additionally, the Options Clearing Corporation provides clearing services for commodity futures, commodity options and security futures, including products listed by ELX. In June 2009, NYSE Euronext and The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation announced the creation of a new clearing house for the clearing of fixed-income securities. We believe that other exchanges may also undertake to provide clearing services. We believe competition in the transaction processing and business services market is based on, among other things, the cost of the services provided; quality and reliability of the services; timely delivery of the services; reputation; and value of linking with existing products, markets and distribution. Competition in our Market Data Business Technology companies, market data and information vendors and front-end software vendors also represent potential competitors because, as purveyors of market data, these firms typically have substantial distribution capabilities. As technology firms, they also have access to trading engines that can be connected to their data and information networks. Additionally, technology and software firms that develop trading systems, hardware and networks that are otherwise outside of the financial services industry may be attracted to enter our markets. This may lead to decreased demand for our market data. Regulatory Matters Our operations as a futures exchange have historically been subject to extensive regulation by the CFTC. The CFTC is an independent federal agency with exclusive jurisdiction over the futures market. The Commission consists of five Commissioners, appointed to staggered five-year terms by the President, with the advice and consent of the Senate. The CFTC carries out the regulation of the futures markets in accordance with the provisions of the CEA and the CFMA. The CFTC is subject to reauthorization every five years, which most recently occurred in 2008. We are extensively regulated by the CFTC. In light of the widespread financial and economic difficulties, particularly acute in the latter half of 2008 and early 2009, there have been many calls for a restructuring of the regulation of financial markets. As a result, various legislative proposals are currently circulating in Congress regarding regulatory reform in the futures and the over-the-counter derivatives markets. These proposals are designed to • reduce systematic risk by mandating central clearing and exchange trading of derivatives; 23 • increase transparency and price discovery; and • prevent fraud and market manipulation. We cannot predict what the final regulations will be or what impact they may have on our business. Among other things, the proposed legislation includes restrictions on speculative trading by means of hard position limits and limitations on hedge exemptions as well as provisions permitting the CFTC to adopt a more rules-based approach rather than our current principles-based approach under the CFTC regulatory regime. The CFTC has also recently issued proposed rules for comment which would establish federally-set position limits for certain energy commodities as well as limit hedge exemptions for specified participants. To the extent the regulatory environment is less beneficial for us or our customers, our business, financial condition and operating results could be negatively affected. The CFMA amended the CEA in 2000 and created the current principles-based regulatory approach. For regulated markets, the CFMA codified a three-tiered regulatory structure for the trading of derivatives that distinguishes among markets based on the types of contracts traded and the sophistication of the market participants. The CFMA generally requires that contract markets, such as our primary exchanges (CME, CBOT, NYMEX and COMEX), register with the CFTC and establish their compliance with 18 core principles: overall compliance with the principles; rule compliance and enforcement; listing of contracts not readily susceptible to market manipulation; trade monitoring system; position or accountability limits; emergency authority; information availability; daily publication of trading information; contract execution; procedures for recording and safe storage of trade information; financial integrity; market participant protections; dispute resolution; fitness standards; conflict of interest management; governing board composition of mutually owned contract markets; recordkeeping; and antitrust considerations. Additionally, the CFMA generally requires that derivatives clearing organizations, like our clearing house, register with the CFTC and demonstrate their compliance with 13 core principles: financial, operational and managerial resources; member and product eligibility; risk management procedures and tools; adequate settlement procedures; treatment of customer funds; member default procedures; rule monitoring and enforcement systems; clearing system safeguards; reporting; recordkeeping; public information; information sharing; and antitrust considerations. Under the oversight of the CFTC, our exchanges are operated as separate self-regulatory organizations. Generally this requires the promotion of market integrity; protection of investors; and enforcement of financial requirements, sales and trading practices of members. CBOT, NYMEX and COMEX outsource responsibility for trade matching, regulatory and clearing services to CME. Our integrated compliance and market surveillance functions allow detailed tracking of all trading and clearing activities. Our regulatory processes are reviewed and audited by the CFTC. The increasing utilization of electronic trading systems by traders, who are not members, from remote locations may, among other developments, impact our ability to continue the traditional form of “self-regulation” that has been an integral part of the CFTC regulatory program. Customers, including high frequency traders, who are guaranteed by a clearing firm and who agree to submit to the jurisdiction of our rules, may be granted direct access to our trading system through their clearing firms. By submitting to our jurisdiction, these customers have the same obligations to comply with our rules as our members. Recently, the securities industry has been criticized for providing its customers with unfiltered access to the market and the SEC has proposed rules that effectively prohibit such unfiltered access and require brokers to implement risk controls to protect the market. While we believe our policies and procedures, including the availability of our risk management tool offerings, address these concerns, we cannot guarantee that new regulations relating to our industry will not be imposed in the future. To the extent any future regulation makes it burdensome for these customers to access our market, they may have less incentive to trade our products and more incentive to move to an unregulated market. Our offering to provide clearing services for credit default swaps is being made pursuant to a special exemption from the SEC which is in effect through March 31, 2010. We expect to have the exemption extended in the future. However, there is no guarantee that the SEC will continue to grant us an exemption. Without this exemption, 24 CME and other market participants would have to comply with extensive registration and reporting requirements, which may discourage market participants from clearing their credit default swap trades through us. We have also “notice registered” with the SEC as a special purpose national securities exchange solely for the purpose of trading security futures products. As a result, the SEC is authorized to review some of our rules relating to these security futures products. Our members trading those products are subject to registration requirements and duties and obligations to customers under the securities laws that do not pertain to their other futures business. The proposed Presidential budget has, from time to time, included a proposal to impose a transaction tax on futures traded domestically to fund the CFTC. The recently released Presidential budget for 2011 did not include a transaction tax but did include a repeal of 60-40 tax treatment for futures transactions. This proposal also has appeared in prior Administration budget plans. These provisions effectively would eliminate the current tax treatment that allows traders to pay a blend of taxes on their gains and losses from trading futures and options with 60% at capital gains rates and 40% at ordinary tax rates. Additionally, recently proposed legislation has included a tax on certain transactions in an effort to pay for the governmental programs instituted in response to the financial crisis and to generate additional funding for job creation in light of the financial crisis. While many participants in the futures industry, including us, oppose these proposals, we cannot guarantee that such proposals will not be enacted. The imposition of any such tax would increase the cost of using our products and, consequently could adversely impact our trading volumes, revenues and profits and may also adversely impact our ability to compete on an international level. Moreover, the Administration’s proposal to repeal 60-40 tax treatment would impose a substantial increase in tax rates applicable to the individuals who are most responsible for creating liquid and efficient regulated markets. Our Members We operate four separate self-regulatory exchanges: CME, CBOT, NYMEX and COMEX. Members are individual traders, as well as most of the world’s largest banks, hedge funds, brokerages and investment houses. Trading on our open outcry trading floors is conducted exclusively by members in Chicago and New York City. Members can execute trades for their own accounts, for clearing firm accounts, for the accounts of other members or for the accounts of customers of clearing firms. Members who trade for their own account, including those who lease trading rights, qualify for lower transaction fees in recognition of the market liquidity that their trading activity provides. These members also benefit from market information advantages that may accrue from their proximity to activity on the trading floors. In 2009, our members were responsible for 75% of our total trading volume. As of December 31, 2009, there were approximately 140 clearing firms. Membership enables a customer to trade specific products at reduced rates and lower fees, and to trade directly from the applicable trading floor or electronically through CME Globex. Memberships can be bought, sold and leased. Our shareholder relations and membership services department maintains an auction market for trading rights at our exchanges. A customer can apply for and hold a membership at CME, CBOT, NYMEX or COMEX—depending on the products intended to be traded. Rights and privileges of membership are exchange-specific. Applicants for membership are required to be of good moral character, reputation and business integrity. They must also have adequate financial resources and credit to assume the responsibilities and privileges of membership. All members must understand the rules and regulations of the applicable exchange and agree to abide by them. Additionally, they must comply with the provisions of the CEA and the rules and regulations issued by the CFTC. A potential member must register with the National Futures Association (NFA) either as a floor trader or floor broker if they intend to access one of our trading floors. If an individual uses the membership for the purpose of filling orders for other members or customers, they must apply to the NFA for a floor broker’s license. Our market regulation department is the investigative and enforcement arm of our exchanges with regard to exchange rules. Members who are found to have violated a rule can be subject to sanctions such as fines, trading suspensions and/or expulsion from the particular exchange. 25 CME Memberships There are four divisions of membership at CME: the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) division; the International Monetary Market (IMM) division; the Index and Option Market (IOM) division; and the Growth and Emerging Markets (GEM) division. Each membership division has different trading rights. Under the terms of CME Group’s certificate of incorporation, members of the CME exchange, as Class B shareholders, have the ability to protect their rights to trade by means of special approval rights over changes to the operation of the markets and are entitled to elect six of the directors on our board, which is currently comprised of a total of 32 individuals. In particular, the certificate of incorporation grants the holders of our Class B common stock the right to approve any changes to the trading floor rights, access rights and privileges that a member has, the number of memberships in each membership class and the related number of authorized shares in each class of Class B common stock, and the eligibility requirements to exercise trading rights or privileges. Class B shareholders must approve any changes to these special rights. We are also required to maintain open outcry trading so long as certain liquidity thresholds are met. Class B shares have the same equitable interest in our earnings and receive the same dividend payments as our Class A shares. CBOT Memberships There are five series of Class B memberships in CBOT represented by memberships in our CBOT subsidiary: Series B-1 (Full) members, Series B-2 (Associate) members, Series B-3 (GIM) members, Series B-4 (IDEM) members and Series B-5 (COM) members. Class B members of CBOT do not possess the right to receive any dividends or distributions, including the proceeds from liquidation, from CBOT. Series B-1 and B-2 members have the right to vote on amendments to certain provisions of the certificate of incorporation of CBOT, including the number of authorized memberships; the relative voting rights of the Series B-1 and B-2 members; the trading rights, voting rights and core rights of Class B members and certain other covenants; and the commitment to maintain open outcry markets for so long as they meet certain liquidity thresholds. Additionally, until our 2012 annual meeting of shareholders, we are required to have at least 10 CBOT directors (as defined in our bylaws) on our board and we are required to provide them with five business days’ advance notice of any change to CBOT’s rules and regulations. If a majority of the CBOT directors determine in their sole discretion that the proposed change will materially impair the business of CBOT or the business opportunities of the holders of the Class B memberships of CBOT, such change will be submitted to a committee of the board of directors of CBOT comprised of three CBOT directors and two CME directors as defined in the bylaws. NYMEX Memberships NYMEX memberships are represented by Class A memberships in our NYMEX subsidiary. In connection with the NYMEX Holdings merger, we made certain commitments to the NYMEX Class A members to maintain a trading floor in New York City until 2012 and thereafter so long as certain profitability and revenue thresholds are met, to limit our rights to relocate open outcry trading to Chicago for NYMEX products, in the event open outcry trading facilities for such products are no longer available on the NYMEX floor, and to maintain fee differentials for NYMEX Class A members for so long as we maintain differentials for our CME and/or CBOT members. NYMEX Class A members do not have the right to receive dividends or distributions from NYMEX. COMEX Memberships Memberships in COMEX are represented by COMEX division memberships in our COMEX subsidiary. There are also COMEX Option memberships. The COMEX Transaction Agreement, executed in November 2006, provides COMEX Division members with certain trading right protections as well as a commitment to provide a trading 26 facility in New York City for so long as open outcry trading exists on the COMEX Division and for a five-year period following the expiration of the COMEX Transaction Agreement. COMEX Division members maintain certain petition rights as it relates to proposed amendments to certain COMEX by-laws and rules. In 2009, a special meeting of COMEX members was held at which time certain bylaw changes were approved, including provisions which would require us to maintain the trading floor until 2012 in exchange for amending the provisions to allow us to include the metals complex in our incentive programs and market maker programs and to allow us to provide certain fee waivers. Subsidiaries Substantially all of our business operations are conducted through our exchange subsidiaries: CME, CBOT, NYMEX and COMEX. The following is a summary of the activities of our other operating subsidiaries. Based on materiality, GFX, CMA, Swapstream and our real estate operations are not reportable segments and, as a result, we do not disclose segment information. C-B-T Corporation. C-B-T Corporation manages both our owned real estate and the general services relating to this real estate such as cleaning, power and telephone services in Chicago. CME Clearing Europe. CME Clearing Europe will be the owner of our UK clearing house which is currently awaiting approval by the Financial Services Authority (FSA). Credit Market Analysis. In March 2008, we acquired CMA and its subsidiaries. CMA is a leading provider of credit derivatives market data designed to enhance the performance of over-the-counter credit market professionals. CMA’s real-time pricing services (CMA QuoteVision) and data services (CMA DataVision) are used by investment professionals in leading investment banks, hedge funds and asset managers worldwide. CMA entities accounted for less than 1% of our consolidated total revenues in 2009 and 2008. GFX Corporation. GFX Corporation (GFX) was established for the purpose of maintaining and creating liquidity in our electronically traded foreign exchange futures contracts. Experienced foreign exchange traders employed by GFX buy and sell our foreign exchange contracts using our CME Globex system. They limit risk from these transactions through offsetting transactions using forward contracts and spot foreign exchange transactions with approved counterparties in the interbank market. On occasion, GFX has also engaged in the trading of Eurodollars and equity index contracts. GFX accounted for less than 1% of our consolidated total revenues in 2009, 2008 and 2007. Swapstream. The Swapstream entities accounted for less than 1% of our consolidated total revenues in 2009, 2008 and 2007. During 2009, we began the process of winding down our Swapstream operations which we expect to be completed in 2010. Swapstream Operating Services Limited, an entity regulated by the Financial Services Authority, was renamed CME Marketing Europe Limited and will continue operations in connection with our global marketing efforts. Licensing Agreements Standard & Poor’s We have had a licensing arrangement with S&P since 1980. In September 2005, all of our previous licensing agreements with S&P were consolidated into one agreement that terminates on December 31, 2017. Under the terms of the agreement, as amended, S&P granted us a license to use certain S&P stock indexes and the related trade names, trademarks and service marks in connection with the creation, marketing, trading, clearing and promoting of futures contracts and/or options on futures contracts that are indexed to certain S&P stock indexes. The license is exclusive through December 31, 2016 and non-exclusive from that date through December 31, 2017 with some exceptions. Our license for the S&P 500 Index remains exclusive through December 31, 2016 so 27 long as certain minimum average trading volume is met or other circumstances exist that relate to the reduction in trading volume. We may pay an additional fee to retain the exclusivity if the minimum average trading volume is not met. For certain products based on S&P stock indexes that we list after the effective date of the amended and restated agreement, we will have an exclusive license for two or three years depending upon the nature of the index, after which we will retain our exclusive rights so long as certain minimum average trading volumes are met. Under the agreement, we maintain our right of first refusal for new stock indexes developed by S&P during the term of the agreement. In the event we fail to launch a product based on a new index within one year, subject to certain considerations for regulatory delays, S&P may elect to terminate the license for such new index or terminate the exclusivity of the license. In exchange for the license, we pay S&P a per trade fee. If S&P discontinues compilation and publication of any license or index, we may license, on a non-exclusive and royalty-free basis, the information regarding the list of companies, shares outstanding and divisors for that index or terminate the obligations regarding the index. The licenses become non-exclusive in the event we list certain competitive products. NASDAQ We have had a licensing arrangement with NASDAQ OMX since 1996 to license the NASDAQ-100 Index and related trade names, trademarks and service marks. The license was extended and expanded in October 2003 to license us both the NASDAQ-100 Index and the NASDAQ Composite Index and in April 2005 to add the NASDAQ Biotechnology Index for trading futures and options on futures contracts that are based on the indexes. In 2008, we agreed to extend the exclusive license agreement through 2019. With respect to the NASDAQ Composite Index, NASDAQ OMX may terminate the exclusivity or the entire license on each anniversary of the agreement in October, if trading volume fails to meet certain performance criteria. During the applicable period of exclusivity, NASDAQ OMX will not grant a license to use the indexes in connection with the trading, marketing and promotion of futures contracts and options on those futures contracts that are based on an index that is exclusive to us. We pay per trade fees to NASDAQ OMX under the license. We have a right of first refusal for new indexes that are licensed for futures products where the index is substantially equivalent to an index licensed to us or is a subset of an index licensed to us. Dow Jones License Agreement We have a licensing agreement with Dow Jones to license certain Dow Jones stock indexes and the related trade names, trademarks and service marks in connection with the creation, marketing, trading, clearing and promoting of futures contracts and/or options on futures contracts that are based upon such Dow Jones stock indexes. Our license of the Dow Jones Composite Index, the Dow Jones Industrial Average Index, the Dow Jones Transportation Average Index and the Dow Jones Utility Average Index is exclusive, and non-exclusive for the Dow Jones U.S. Real Estate Index. We also have a right of first refusal for new indexes developed by Dow Jones prior to December 31, 2010 and the right to sublicense our exclusive license rights under the agreement to any other exchange for the trading of futures contracts and options on futures contracts. The initial term of the agreement is through December 31, 2014. Following the initial term, the agreement shall automatically renew for a first renewal term of five years and then for successive annual renewal terms thereafter unless terminated by either party in writing prior to the end of the applicable term. In exchange for the license, we pay a per trade fee with a guaranteed annual minimum license fee and an upfront fee paid in January 2008. On February 10, 2010, we announced that we had entered into a definitive agreement with Dow Jones to create a new joint venture that will own the Dow Jones Indexes, which includes the Dow Jones Industrial Average and approximately 130,000 index properties. British Bankers Association License and Membership Agreement We have a licensing and membership agreement with BBA Enterprises Limited and the British Bankers’ Association for the use of its London Interbank Offered Rate to settle several of our interest rate products, including our Eurodollar contract. Pursuant to the agreement, we will also serve as an exchange associate 28 member of the British Bankers’ Association during the term of the agreement. The license is non-transferable and non-exclusive. The initial term of the agreement is for ten years through September 2019 with automatic renewal terms of five years unless terminated by either party in writing prior to the end of the applicable term. For the license we paid an upfront fee and will pay annual fees that may be increased by the BBA subject to a cap. Intellectual Property We regard substantial elements of our brand name, marketing elements and logos, products, market data, software and technology as proprietary. We attempt to protect these elements by relying on trademark, service mark, copyright and trade secret laws, restrictions on disclosure and other methods. For example, with respect to trademarks, we have registered marks in numerous countries all over the world. We have filed numerous patent applications in the United States and internationally to protect our technology. In December 2006, the United States Patent and Trademark Office granted CME its first patent. Our rights to stock indexes for our futures products principally derive from license agreements that we have obtained from S&P, NASDAQ OMX and Dow Jones and others. For a more detailed discussion of these licenses, see the section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K entitled “Item 1. Business—Licensing Agreements.” Various other CME Group products rely on license agreements from third parties. We cannot assure you that competitors will not attempt to enter these markets or create similar products. Nor can we assure you that we will be able to renew or maintain those license agreements beyond their current terms. We regularly review our intellectual property to identify property that should be protected, the extent of current protection for that property and the availability of additional protection. We believe our various trademarks and service marks have been registered or applied for where needed. We also seek to protect our software and databases as trade secrets and under copyright law. We have copyright registrations for certain of our software, user manuals, and databases. Legal developments allowing patent protection for methods of doing business hold the possibility of additional protection, which we continue to pursue. Patents of third parties may have an important bearing on our ability to offer certain of our products and services. It is possible that, from time to time, we may face claims of infringement that could interfere with our ability to use technology or other intellectual property that is material to our business. Employees As of December 31, 2009, we had approximately 2,260 employees. We consider relations with our employees to be good. We have never experienced a work stoppage. As of December 31, 2009, 14 of our employees were represented by one of the following unions: • Chicago Regional Council of Carpenters; and • International Union of Operating Engineers Local 399, AFL-CIO.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS In addition to the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, you should carefully consider the factors discussed below, which are the risks that we believe are material at this time. These risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. These risks and uncertainties are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business. RISKS RELATING TO OUR INDUSTRY Our business is subject to the impact of domestic and international market and economic conditions which are beyond our control and which could significantly reduce our trading volumes and make our financial results more volatile. Our revenue is substantially dependent on the trading volume in our markets. Our trading volume is directly affected by U.S. domestic and international factors that are beyond our control, including: • economic, political and geopolitical market conditions; • natural disasters and other catastrophes; • broad trends in industry and finance; • changes in price levels, trading volumes and volatility in the derivatives markets and in underlying fixed-income, equity, foreign exchange and commodity markets; • legislative and regulatory changes; • competition; • changes in government monetary policies; • consolidation in our customer base and within our industry; and • inflation. Any one or more of these factors may contribute to reduced activity in our markets. Historically, our trading volume has tended to increase during periods of uncertainty due to increased hedging activity and needs to manage the risks associated with, or speculate on, volatility in the U.S. equity markets, fluctuations in interest rates and price changes in the foreign exchange, commodity and other markets. However, during the recent economic volatility, we have experienced decreased volume due primarily to our customers decreasing their risk exposure, stable low interest rates and the lack of available capital. As a result, period-to-period comparisons of our financial results are not necessarily meaningful. This trend as well as future economic uncertainty may result in continued decreased trading volume and a more difficult business environment for us. Material decreases in trading volume would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results. 32 The recent financial crisis and related market developments may adversely affect our industry, business and results of operations. We generate revenues primarily from our clearing and transaction fees. Declines in trading volumes and market liquidity would adversely affect our business and financial condition. During late 2008 and 2009, the global financial services industry and securities markets experienced significant and adverse conditions, including significantly increased volatility, outflows of customer funds and securities, losses resulting from declining asset values, defaults on securities and reduced liquidity. As a result, many financial institutions required additional capital infusions, merged with larger and stronger institutions, became bank holding companies regulated by the Federal Reserve Bank and, in some cases, failed. As a result of this instability of the financial markets and the lack of readily available credit, commercial banks, investment banks, mutual and hedge funds and other of our customers decreased their risk exposure and trading volume. Consequently, our overall trading volume in 2009 decreased 20% from 2008 on a pro forma basis to include NYMEX trading volume for all of 2008. We also experienced a decline in subscriptions for our market data as a result of the consolidation of our customers and employee layoffs at many of our customers. If our customers further reduce their level of trading activity for any reason, including a reduction in the number of traders, reduced trading demand by their customers or a decision to curtail or cease speculative trading, our business and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. We operate in a heavily regulated environment that imposes significant costs and competitive burdens on our business. We are extensively regulated by the CFTC. In light of the widespread financial and economic difficulties, particularly acute in the latter half of 2008 and early 2009, there have been many calls for a restructuring of the regulation of financial markets. As a result, various legislative proposals are currently circulating in Congress regarding regulatory reform in the futures and the over-the-counter derivatives markets. These proposals are designed to • reduce systematic risk through central clearing and exchange trading of derivatives; • increase transparency and price discovery; and • prevent fraud and market manipulation. We cannot predict what the final regulations will be or what impact they may have on our business. Among other things, under the pending legislation there may be restrictions on speculative trading by means of hard position limits in all contracts and limitations on hedge exemptions that could affect trading volume. In addition, future regulations could limit speculation in our markets or permit the CFTC to adopt a more rules-based approach rather than our current principles-based approach under the CFTC regulatory regime. To the extent the regulatory environment is less beneficial for us or our customers, our business, financial condition and operating results could be negatively affected. Additionally, the increasing utilization of electronic trading systems by traders, who are not members, from remote locations may, among other developments, impact our ability to continue the traditional form of “self-regulation” that has been an integral part of the CFTC regulatory program. Customers, including high frequency traders, who are guaranteed by a clearing firm and who agree to submit to the jurisdiction of our rules, may be granted direct access to our trading system through their clearing firms. By submitting to our jurisdiction, these customers have the same obligations to comply with our rules as our members. Recently, the securities industry has been criticized for providing its customers with unfiltered access to the market and the SEC has proposed rules that effectively prohibit such unfiltered access and require brokers to implement risk controls to protect the market. While we believe our policies and procedures, including the availability of our risk management tool offerings, address these concerns, we cannot guarantee that new regulations relating to our industry will not be imposed in the future. To the extent any future regulation makes it burdensome for these customers to access our market, they may have less incentive to trade our products and more incentive to move to an unregulated market. 33 The CFTC has broad powers to investigate and enforce compliance and punish non-compliance with its rules and regulations. We cannot assure you that we and/or our directors, officers, employees and affiliates will be able to fully comply with these rules and regulations. We also cannot assure you that we will not be subject to claims or actions by the CFTC or other agencies. If we fail to comply with applicable laws, rules or regulations, we may be subject to censure, fines, cease-and-desist orders, suspension of our business, removal of personnel or other sanctions, including revocation of our designations as a contract market and derivatives clearing organization. The proposed Presidential budget has, from time to time, included a proposal to impose a transaction tax on futures traded domestically to fund the CFTC. The recently released Presidential budget for 2011 did not include a transaction tax but did include a repeal of 60-40 tax treatment for futures transactions. This proposal also has appeared in prior Administration budget plans. These provisions effectively would eliminate the current tax treatment that allows traders to pay a blend of taxes on their gains and losses from trading futures and options with 60% at capital gains rates and 40% at ordinary tax rates. Additionally, recently proposed legislation has included a tax on certain transactions in an effort to pay for the governmental programs instituted in response to the financial crisis and to generate additional funding for job creation in light of the financial crisis. While many participants in the futures industry, including us, oppose these proposals, we cannot guarantee that such proposals will not be enacted. The imposition of any such tax would increase the cost of using our products and, consequently could adversely impact our trading volumes, revenues and profits and may also adversely impact our ability to compete on an international level. Moreover, the Administration’s proposal to repeal 60-40 tax treatment would impose a substantial increase in tax rates applicable to the individuals who are most responsible for creating liquid and efficient regulated markets. Some of our largest clearing firms have indicated their belief that clearing facilities should not be owned or controlled by exchanges and should be operated as utilities and not for profit. These clearing firms have sought, and may seek in the future, legislative or regulatory changes that would, if adopted, enable them to use alternative clearing services for positions established on our exchanges or to freely move open positions among clearing houses in order to take advantage of our liquidity. Even if they are not successful, these factors may cause them to limit the use of our markets. Some of our largest clearing firms, which are significant customers and intermediaries in our products, have stressed the importance to them of centralizing clearing of futures contracts and options on futures contracts in order to maximize the efficient use of their capital, exercise greater control over their value at risk and extract greater operating leverage from clearing activities. Many clearing firms have expressed the view that clearing firms should control the governance of clearing houses or that clearing houses should be operated as utilities rather than as part of for-profit enterprises. Some of these firms, along with the Futures Industry Association and the U.S. Department of Treasury, have sought, and may seek in the future, legislative or regulatory changes to be adopted that would facilitate mechanisms or policies that allow market participants to transfer positions from an exchange-owned clearing house to a clearing house owned and controlled by clearing firms. Our strategic business plan is to operate a vertically integrated transaction execution, clearing and settlement business for our futures and options on futures business. If these legislative or regulatory changes are adopted, our strategy and business plan may lead clearing firms to establish, or seek to use, alternative clearing houses for clearing positions established on our exchanges. Even if they are not successful in their efforts, the factors described above may cause clearing firms to limit or stop the use of our products and markets. If any of these events occur, our revenues and profits would be adversely affected. The imposition in the future of regulations requiring that clearing houses establish linkages with other clearing houses whereby positions at one clearing house can be transferred to and maintained at another clearing house may have a material adverse effect on the operation of our business. In connection with the trading of single stock futures and futures on narrow-based stock indexes, the CFMA contemplates that, once certain market penetration thresholds are crossed, clearing houses will establish linkages enabling a position in any such product executed on an exchange for which it clears these products to be offset by 34 an economically linked or fungible position on the opposite side of the market that is executed on another exchange utilizing a different clearing house. If, in the future, a similar requirement is imposed with respect to futures contracts generally, the resulting unbundling of trade execution and clearing services would have a material adverse effect on our revenues and profits. We face intense competition from other companies, including some of our members. If we are not able to successfully compete, our business will not survive. The derivatives, securities and financial services industries are highly competitive. We expect that competition will continue to intensify. Our current and prospective competitors, both domestically and around the world, are numerous. They include securities and securities option exchanges, futures exchanges, over-the-counter markets, clearing organizations, market data and information vendors, electronic communications networks, crossing systems and similar entities, consortia of large customers, consortia of some of our clearing firms and electronic brokerage and dealing facilities. The global derivatives industry has grown increasingly competitive. Exchanges, intermediaries, and even end users are consolidating, and over-the-counter and unregulated entities are constantly evolving. Additionally, in response to growing competition, many marketplaces in both Europe and the United States have demutualized to provide greater flexibility for future growth. In 2007, we completed our merger with CBOT Holdings, NYSE Group completed its merger with Euronext and ICE acquired the New York Board of Trade and the Winnipeg Commodity Exchange. In 2008, we completed our acquisition of NYMEX Holdings. In March 2009, ICE acquired The Clearing Corporation, an independent clearing house owned by large derivatives dealers. In the last three years there has been a significant increase in activity among derivative dealers, banks and other entities to form competing exchanges. In 2007, a consortium of 12 financial institutions formed an exchange, ELX, to enter the futures market, which began trading in July 2009. ELX’s initial product line included electronic trading in U.S. Treasury futures in the two-, five-, and ten-year notes and thirty-year bond contracts in competition with CBOT’s treasury complex. Recently, ELX requested that the CFTC compel CBOT to accept certain non-competitive trades as a means to permit two customers, with equal and opposite positions at CBOT, to transfer those positions to ELX. We believe that such transactions would violate the CEA and are prohibited by CBOT rules. At this time, the CFTC has not required us to take any action or modify our existing rules. We expect the CFTC to review the ELX request. We also face competition from IntercontinentalExchange’s energy index, natural gas, credit default swaps, equity index, foreign exchange and other products; from NYSE Euronext and the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation due to their creation of a new clearing house for the clearing of fixed-income derivatives; as well as the Options Clearing Corporation which provides clearing services for commodity futures, commodity options and security futures, including products listed by ELX. New entrants into our industry may increase competitive pressure on us. We believe we may also face competition from large computer software companies and media and technology companies. The number of businesses providing internet-related financial services is rapidly growing. Other companies have entered into or are forming joint ventures or consortia to provide services similar to those provided by us. Others may become competitive with us through acquisitions. Federal law allows institutions that have been major participants on our exchange to trade the same or similar products among themselves without utilizing any exchange or trading system. Many of our competitors and potential competitors have greater financial, marketing, technological and personnel resources than we do. These factors may enable them to develop similar products, to provide lower transaction costs and better execution to their customers and to carry out their business strategies more quickly and efficiently than we can. In addition, our competitors may: • respond more quickly to competitive pressures, including responses based upon their corporate governance structures, which may be more flexible and efficient than our corporate governance structure; • develop products that are preferred by our customers; • develop risk transfer products that compete with our products; • price their products and services more competitively; 35 • develop and expand their network infrastructure and service offerings more efficiently; • utilize better, more user-friendly and more reliable technology; • take greater advantage of acquisitions, alliances and other opportunities; • more effectively market, promote and sell their products and services; • better leverage existing relationships with customers and alliance partners or exploit better recognized brand names to market and sell their services; and • exploit regulatory disparities between traditional, regulated exchanges and alternative markets that benefit from a reduced regulatory burden and lower-cost business model. If our products, markets and services are not competitive, our business, financial condition and operating results will be materially harmed. A decline in our fees or any loss of customers could lower our revenues, which would adversely affect our profitability. Future changes in regulations as a result of the focus on restructuring the regulation of the financial markets or otherwise, may adversely impact our ability to compete, especially on a global basis. Our trading volume, and consequently our revenues and profits, would be adversely affected if we are unable to retain our current customers or attract new customers to our exchange. The success of our business depends, in part, on our ability to maintain and increase our trading volume. To do so, we must maintain and expand our product offerings, our customer base and our trade execution facilities. Our success also depends on our ability to maintain our trading volume and to offer competitive prices and services in an increasingly price sensitive business. We cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to expand our product lines, or that we will be able to retain our current customers or attract new customers. We bill a substantial portion of our clearing and transaction fees to our clearing firms. The majority of clearing and transaction fees received from clearing firms represent charges for trades executed and cleared on behalf of their customers. As of December 31, 2009, we had approximately 140 clearing firms. One firm represented 11% and one firm represented 10% of our clearing and transaction fees revenue for the year. Should a clearing firm withdraw, we believe that the customer portion of the firm’s trading activity would likely transfer to another clearing firm of the exchange. However, many of our clearing firms also engage in proprietary trading. As a result of the recent financial crisis, many of our customers have decreased the level of their proprietary trading. Additionally, a proposal from the Presidential Administration seeks to limit the ability of banks, many of which are our customers, to engage in proprietary trading. We cannot guarantee you that the discontinuation of any clearing firm would not result in our loss of customers, a loss of trading volume as a result of the consolidation of trading accounts at the acquiring firm or as a result of decreased proprietary trading. We also cannot assure you that we will not lose customers to low-cost competitors with comparable or superior products, services or trade execution facilities. If we fail to maintain our trading volume, expand our product offerings or execution facilities, or we lose a substantial number of our current customers, or a subset of customers representing a significant percentage of trading volume in a particular product line; or are unable to attract new customers, our business and revenues will be adversely affected. Furthermore, declines in trading volume due to loss of customers may negatively impact market liquidity, which could lead to further loss of trading volume. As a financial services provider, we are subject to significant litigation risk and potential securities law liability. Many aspects of our business involve substantial liability risks. While we generally are protected by governmental immunity for some of our market-related activities, we could be exposed to substantial liability 36 under federal and state laws and court decisions, as well as rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC and the CFTC. These risks include, among others, potential liability from disputes over terms of a trade, the claim that a system failure or delay caused monetary losses to a customer, that we entered into an unauthorized transaction or that we provided materially false or misleading statements in connection with a transaction. Dissatisfied customers frequently make claims regarding quality of trade execution, improperly settled trades, mismanagement or even fraud against their service providers. We may become subject to these claims as a result of failures or malfunctions of our systems and services we provide. We could incur significant legal expenses defending claims, even those without merit. In addition, an adverse resolution of any future lawsuit or claim against us could have a material adverse effect on our business. We may be at greater risk from terrorism than other companies. We may be more likely than other companies to be a direct target of, or an indirect casualty of, attacks by terrorists or terrorist organizations. It is impossible to predict the likelihood or impact of any terrorist attack on the derivatives industry generally or on our business. For example, the September 11, 2001 terrorist attack on the World Trade Center resulted in the closing of NYMEX’s trading and clearing operations for four business days and rendered its backup data and recovery center inoperable. While we have undertaken significant measures to develop business continuity plans and to establish backup sites, in the event of an attack or a threat of an attack, these security measures and contingency plans may be inadequate to prevent significant disruptions in our business, technology or access to the infrastructure necessary to maintain our business. Damage to our facilities due to terrorist attacks may be significantly in excess of any amount of insurance received, or we may not be able to insure against such damage at a reasonable price or at all. The threat of terrorist attacks may also negatively affect our ability to attract and retain employees. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. RISKS RELATING TO OUR BUSINESS The success of our markets will depend on our ability to complete development of and successfully implement electronic trading systems that have the functionality, performance, reliability and speed required by our customers. The future success of our business depends in large part on our ability to create interactive electronic marketplaces in a wide range of derivatives products that have the required functionality, performance, capacity, reliability and speed to attract and retain customers. A significant portion of our overall volume is generated through electronic trading on our CME Globex electronic platform. We must continue to enhance our electronic trading platform to remain competitive. As a result, we will continue to be subject to risks, expenses and uncertainties encountered in the rapidly evolving market for electronic transaction services. These risks include our failure or inability to: • provide reliable and cost-effective services to our customers; • develop, in a timely manner, the required functionality to support electronic trading in our key products in a manner that is competitive with the functionality supported by other electronic markets; • match fees of our competitors that offer only electronic trading facilities; • attract independent software vendors to write front-end software that will effectively access our electronic trading system and automated order routing system; • respond to technological developments or service offerings by competitors; and • generate sufficient revenue to justify the substantial capital investment we have made and will continue to make to enhance our electronic trading platform. 37 If we do not successfully enhance our electronic trading platform, or our current or potential customers do not accept it, our revenues and profits will be adversely affected. Additionally, we rely on our customers’ ability to have the necessary back office functionality to support our new products and our trading and clearing functionality. To the extent our customers are not prepared and/or lack the resources or infrastructure, the success of our new initiatives may be compromised. In addition, if we are unable to develop our electronic trading systems to include other products and markets, or if our electronic trading systems do not have the required functionality, performance, capacity, reliability and speed, we may not be able to compete successfully in an environment that is increasingly dominated by electronic trading. If we experience systems failures or capacity constraints, our ability to conduct our operations and execute our business strategy could be materially harmed and we could be subjected to significant costs and liabilities. We are heavily dependent on the capacity, reliability and security of the computer and communications systems and software supporting our operations. We receive and/or process a large portion of our trade orders through electronic means, such as through public and private communications networks. Our systems, or those of our third party providers, may fail or operate slowly, causing one or more of the following to occur: • unanticipated disruptions in service to our customers; • slower response times; • delays in our customers’ trade execution; • failed settlement of trades; • incomplete or inaccurate accounting, recording or processing of trades; • financial losses; • security breaches; • litigation or other customer claims; • loss of customers; and • regulatory sanctions. We cannot assure you that we will not experience systems failures from power or telecommunications failure, acts of God, war or terrorism, human error, natural disasters, fire, sabotage, hardware or software malfunctions or defects, computer viruses, acts of vandalism or similar occurrences. If any of our systems do not operate properly or are disabled, including as a result of system failure, employee or customer error or misuse of our systems, we could suffer financial loss, liability to customers, regulatory intervention or reputational damage that could affect demand by current and potential users of our market. From time to time, we have experienced system errors and failures that have resulted in some customers being unable to connect to our electronic trading platform, or that resulted in erroneous reporting, such as transactions that were not authorized by any customer or reporting of filled orders as cancelled. We cannot assure you that if we experience system errors or failures in the future that they will not have a material impact on our business. Any such system failures that cause an interruption in service or decrease our responsiveness could impair our reputation, damage our brand name or have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. Our status as a CFTC registrant generally requires that our trade execution and communications systems be able to handle anticipated present and future peak trading volume. Heavy use of our computer systems during peak trading times or at times of unusual market volatility could cause our systems to operate slowly or even to fail for 38 periods of time. We constantly monitor system loads and performance and regularly implement system upgrades to handle estimated increases in trading volume. However, we cannot assure you that our estimates of future trading volume and order messaging traffic will be accurate or that our systems will always be able to accommodate actual trading volume and order messaging traffic without failure or degradation of performance. Increased CME Globex trading volume and order messaging traffic may result in connectivity problems or erroneous reports that may affect users of the platform. System failure or degradation could lead our customers to file formal complaints with industry regulatory organizations, to file lawsuits against us or to cease doing business with us, or could lead the CFTC or other regulators to initiate inquiries or proceedings for failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations. We will need to continue to upgrade, expand and increase the capacity of our systems as our business grows and we execute our business strategy. Generally, our goal is to design our systems to handle at least one-and-a-half times our peak historical transactions in our highest volume products. As volumes of transactions grow, the ability of our systems to meet this goal on an ongoing basis depends on our ability to increase our system capacity on a timely basis while maintaining system reliability. Although many of our systems are designed to accommodate additional volume and products and services without redesign or replacement, we will need to continue to make significant investments in additional hardware and software to accommodate the increases in volume of transactions and order transaction traffic and to provide processing services to third parties. If we cannot increase the capacity and capabilities of our systems to accommodate an increasing volume of transactions and to execute our business strategy, our ability to maintain or expand our businesses would be adversely affected. Our networks and those of our third party service providers may be vulnerable to security risks, which could result in wrongful use of our information or cause interruptions in our operations that cause us to lose customers and trading volume and result in significant liabilities. We could also be required to incur significant expense to protect our systems. We expect the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks to continue to be a critical element of our operations. Our networks and those of our third party service providers and our customers may be vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer viruses and other security problems. Persons who circumvent security measures could wrongfully use our information or cause interruptions or malfunctions in our operations. Any of these events could cause us to lose customers or trading volume. We may be required to expend significant resources to protect against the threat of security breaches or to alleviate problems, including reputational harm and litigation, caused by breaches. Although we intend to continue to implement security measures, these measures may prove to be inadequate and result in system failures and delays that could cause us to lose customers, experience lower trading volume and incur significant liabilities. We, as well as many of our customers, depend on third party suppliers and service providers for a number of services that are important. An interruption or cessation of an important supply or service by any third party could have a material adverse effect on our business, including revenues derived from our customers’ trading activity. We depend on a number of suppliers, such as banking, clearing and settlement organizations, telephone companies, online service providers, data processors, and software and hardware vendors for elements of our trading, clearing and other systems, as well as communications and networking equipment, computer hardware and software and related support and maintenance. Many of our customers rely on third parties, such as independent software vendors, to provide them with front-end systems to access our CME Globex platform. While these third parties have undertaken to keep current with our enhancements and changes to our interfaces and functionality, we cannot guarantee that these third parties will continue to make the necessary monetary and time investments to keep up with our changes. In the event that these software programs do not interact with our platform seamlessly, our customers could be impacted, which could lead to a decrease in trading volume. 39 To the extent any of our service providers or the organizations that provide services to our customers in connection with their trading activities cease to provide these services in an efficient, cost-effective manner or fail to adequately expand their services to meet our needs, we could experience decreased trading volume, lower revenues and higher costs. Our clearing house operations expose us to substantial credit risk of third parties and the level of soundness of our clearing firms could adversely affect us. CME, our subsidiary, owns and operates its own clearing house, which acts as the counterparty to all trades consummated on or through our futures exchanges or on third-party exchanges for which we may provide clearing services. As a result, we have exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and we routinely guarantee transactions with counterparties in the financial industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, mutual and hedge funds, and other institutional customers. As a result of the recent financial crisis, many financial institutions required additional capital infusions, merged with larger and stronger institutions, became bank holding companies that are regulated by the Federal Reserve Bank and, in some cases, failed. For example, during 2008, The Bear Stearns Companies, Inc., Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. and American International Group, Inc., all of which were parent companies of clearing firms of our exchange, experienced significant financial write-downs and in some cases failed. Although none of these cases resulted in a default of a clearing firm, additional companies, including our clearing firms, may continue to encounter economic difficulties during this period of economic uncertainty. As part of our overall growth initiatives, we have expanded our clearing services to the over-the-counter market in addition to standard futures and options on futures products, including through CME ClearPort and our credit default swap clearing initiative. The process for deriving margins and performance bonds for over-the-counter products is different and, in part, seeks to assess and capture different risks than our historical practices applied to our futures products. Although we believe that we have carefully analyzed the process for setting our financial safeguards for over-the-counter products, there is no guarantee that our risk management procedures will adequately protect us from the unique risks of these products as we have not historically provided clearing services to this market. We also plan to launch a separate UK clearing house following receipt of regulatory approval from the Financial Services Authority. We have limited experience operating a clearing house outside of the United States. The UK clearing house will operate independently of our U.S. clearing house and will have its own guarantee fund as part of its risk management policies and procedures. A substantial part of our working capital may be at risk if a clearing firm defaults on its obligations to our clearing house and its margin and security deposits are insufficient to meet its obligations. Although we have policies and procedures to help ensure that our clearing firms can satisfy their obligations, these policies and procedures may not succeed in detecting problems or preventing defaults. We also have in place various measures intended to enable us to cover any default and maintain liquidity. However, we cannot assure you that these measures will be sufficient to protect us from a default or that we will not be materially and adversely affected in the event of a significant default. The required capital and posted collateral of our clearing firms may lose value given the volatility of the market. To become a clearing member, a firm must meet certain minimum capital requirements and must deposit a certain amount of funds with our clearing house as collateral for their trading activity. The funds used to satisfy these requirements may be cash or held in certain permissible investments, such as regulated money market mutual funds, U.S. Treasury securities and asset-backed securities. Given the level of market volatility, there is no guarantee that these investments will continue to maintain their value. To the extent a clearing firm was not in compliance with these requirements, it would be required to acquire additional funds, decrease its proprietary 40 trading activity and/or transfer customer accounts to another clearing firm. These actions could result in a decrease in trading activity in our products. Our market data revenues may be reduced or eliminated by decreased demand, overall economic conditions or the growth of electronic trading and electronic order entry systems. If we are unable to offset that reduction through terminal usage fees or transaction fees, we will experience a reduction in revenue. We sell our market data to individuals and organizations that use our markets or monitor general economic conditions. Revenues from our market data totaled $331.1 million, representing 13% of our total revenues, and $279.5 million, representing 11% of our total revenues, during the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. A decrease in overall trading volume may also lead to a decreased demand for our market data from the market data vendors. For example, we believe that the decrease in the average number of devices for CME and CBOT market data from approximately 296,000 for 2008 to approximately 274,000 for 2009 is due primarily to cost cutting initiatives at customer firms. Additionally, electronic trading systems do not usually impose separate exchange fees for supplying market data to trading terminals. If we do not separately charge for market data supplied to trading terminals, and trading terminals with access to our markets become widely available, we could lose market data fees from those who have access to trading terminals. We will experience a reduction in our revenues if we are unable to recover that lost market data revenue through terminal usage fees or transaction fees. A key element of our strategy is to provide transaction processing services to third parties. Our failure to identify future opportunities to provide these services will have a negative impact on our ability to grow our business. Providing third-party transaction processing services is a key element of our strategy. Pursuant to transaction-processing agreements, we previously provided these services to NYMEX and to CBOT. Prior to our acquisition of these companies, we derived a significant amount of revenue from these service agreements. We have entered into other transaction-processing arrangements with BM&FBOVESPA, the Korea Exchange, the Dubai Mercantile Exchange and Bursa Malaysia Derivatives. We cannot assure you that such arrangements will be as profitable as our previous arrangements with NYMEX and CBOT or that we will enter into additional agreements to provide processing services in the future. Our failure to capitalize on our existing arrangements and to identify future opportunities may have a negative impact on our ability to generate additional revenues and grow our business. We may have difficulty executing our growth strategy and maintaining our growth effectively. We continue to focus on strategic initiatives to grow our business, including our efforts to serve the over-the-counter market as discussed in the following risk factor and to distribute our products and services on a global basis. There is no guarantee that our efforts will be successful. Continued growth will require additional investment in personnel, facilities, information technology infrastructure and financial and management systems and controls and may place a significant strain on our management and resources. We may not be successful in implementing all of the processes that are necessary to support our growth organically or, as described below, through acquisitions, investments or other strategic alliances. Unless our growth results in an increase in our revenues that is proportionate to the increase in our costs associated with our growth, our future profitability could be adversely affected, and we may have to incur significant expenditures to address the additional operational and control requirements as a result of our growth. There is no guarantee that our over-the-counter initiatives will be successful. Our goal is to grow our business by expanding our clearing services and product offerings to reach the over-the-counter market. In December 2009, we initiated our pre-launch of our clearing services for the credit default swaps market. Our offering is being made pursuant to a special exemption from the SEC which is in 41 effect through March 31, 2010. We expect to have the exemption extended in the future. However, there is no guarantee that the SEC will continue to grant us an exemption. Without this exemption, CME and other market participants would have to comply with extensive registration and reporting requirements, which may discourage market participants from clearing their credit default swap trades through us. Our strategy also includes extending our over-the-counter services into other assets classes, such as interest rates and foreign exchange, as well as enhancing our CME ClearPort functionality to support additional products. The current regulatory environment for trading and clearing over-the-counter products, including credit default swaps, is uncertain. We cannot be certain that we will be able to operate profitably in the event that future legislation or regulation adversely affects the trading of over-the-counter products or reduces the demand for our offerings. In addition, a number of market participants and exchanges have developed competing platforms and products, including IntercontinentalExchange’s offering for credit default swaps. We cannot be certain that we will be able to compete effectively or that our initiatives will be successful. We intend to continue to explore acquisitions, investments and other strategic alliances. We may not be successful in identifying opportunities or in integrating the acquired businesses. Any such transaction may not produce the results we anticipate which could adversely affect our business and our stock price. We intend to continue to explore and pursue acquisitions and other strategic opportunities to strengthen our business and grow our company. We may make acquisitions or investments or enter into strategic partnerships, joint ventures and other alliances. The market for such transactions is highly competitive, especially in light of the increasing consolidation in our industry. As a result, we may be unable to identify strategic opportunities or we may be unable to negotiate or finance future transactions on terms favorable to us. To the extent the trend of consolidation in our industry continues, we may encounter increased difficulties in identifying growth opportunities. We may finance future transactions by issuing additional equity and/or debt. The issuance of additional equity in connection with any future transaction could be substantially dilutive to our existing shareholders. The issuance of additional debt could increase our leverage substantially. The process of integration may also produce unforeseen regulatory and operating difficulties and expenditures and may divert the attention of management from the ongoing operation of our business. To the extent we enter into joint ventures and alliances, we may experience difficulties in the development and expansion of the business of any newly formed ventures, in the exercise of influence over the activities of any ventures in which we do not have a controlling interest as well as encounter potential conflicts with our joint venture or alliance partners. We may not realize the anticipated growth and other benefits from strategic growth initiatives we have made or will make in the future which may have an adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results. As discussed below, we may also be required to take an impairment charge on our financial statements which could negatively impact our stock price. Expansion of our operations internationally involves special challenges that we may not be able to meet, which could adversely affect our financial results. We plan to continue to expand our operations internationally, including by establishing a UK clearing house, directly placing order entry terminals with customers outside the United States and by relying on distribution systems established by our current and future strategic alliance partners. We face certain risks inherent in doing business in international markets, particularly in the regulated derivatives exchange business. These risks include: • restrictions on the use of trading terminals or the contracts that may be traded; • becoming subject to extensive regulations and oversight, tariffs and other trade barriers; • difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations; • general economic and political conditions in the countries from which our markets are accessed, which may have an adverse effect on our volume from those countries; and • potentially adverse tax consequences. 42 In addition, as a result of our expanding global operations, we will become subject to the laws and regulations of foreign governmental and regulatory authorities, including the Financial Services Authority in connection with our UK clearing house. These may include laws, rules and regulations relating to any aspect of the derivatives business. To date, we have had limited experience in marketing and operating our products and services internationally. We cannot assure you that we will be able to succeed in marketing our products and services in international markets. We may also experience difficulty in managing our international operations because of, among other things, competitive conditions overseas, management of foreign exchange risk, established domestic markets, language and cultural differences and economic or political instability. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on the success of our international operations and, consequently, on our business, financial condition and operating results. Our compliance and risk management methods might not be effective and may result in outcomes that could adversely affect our reputation, financial condition and operating results. Generally, the CFTC has broad enforcement powers to censure, fine, issue cease-and-desist orders, prohibit us from engaging in some of our businesses or suspend or revoke our designation as a contract market or the registration of any of our officers or employees who violate applicable laws or regulations. Our ability to comply with applicable laws and rules is largely dependent on our establishment and maintenance of compliance, audit and reporting systems, as well as our ability to attract and retain qualified compliance and other risk management personnel. We face the risk of significant intervention by regulatory authorities, including extensive examination and surveillance activity. In the case of non-compliance or alleged non-compliance with applicable laws or regulations, we could be subject to investigations and judicial or administrative proceedings that may result in substantial penalties or civil lawsuits, including by customers, for damages, which can be significant. Any of these outcomes would adversely affect our reputation, financial condition and operating results. In extreme cases, these outcomes could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business. Our policies and procedures to identify, monitor and manage our risks may not be fully effective. Some of our risk management methods depend upon evaluation of information regarding markets, customers or other matters that are publicly available or otherwise accessible by us. That information may not in all cases be accurate, complete, up-to-date or properly evaluated. Management of operational, financial, legal, regulatory and strategic risk requires, among other things, policies and procedures to record properly and verify a large number of transactions and events. We cannot assure you that our policies and procedures will always be effective or that we will always be successful in monitoring or evaluating the risks to which we are or may be exposed. We could be harmed by misconduct or errors that are difficult to detect and deter. There have been a number of highly publicized cases involving fraud or other misconduct by employees of financial services firms in recent years. For example, in 2008 a mid-level trader at Societe Generale engaged in unauthorized trading which cost Societe approximately $7 billion and a trader at MF Global, one our clearing firms, lost approximately $140 million in connection with unauthorized trades. Misconduct by our employees and agents, including employees of GFX, our wholly-owned subsidiary that engages primarily in proprietary trading in foreign exchange futures, could include hiding unauthorized activities from us, improper or unauthorized activities on behalf of customers or improper use of confidential information. Misconduct could subject us to financial losses or regulatory sanctions and seriously harm our reputation. It is not always possible to deter misconduct, and the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases. Our employees and agents, including our GFX employees, also may commit errors that could subject us to financial claims for negligence, as well as regulatory actions. We may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights, which may materially harm our business. We rely primarily on trade secret, copyright, service mark, trademark and patent law and contractual protections to protect our proprietary technology and other proprietary rights. We have filed several patent applications 43 covering our technology in the United States and certain other jurisdictions. Notwithstanding the precautions we take to protect our intellectual property rights, it is possible that third parties may copy or otherwise obtain and use our proprietary technology without authorization or otherwise infringe on our rights. We also seek to protect our software and databases as trade secrets and under copyright law. We have copyright registrations for certain of our software, user manuals and databases. The copyright protection afforded to databases, however, is fairly limited. While the arrangement and selection of data generally are protectable, the actual data may not be, and others may be free to create databases that would perform the same function. In some cases, including for a number of our most important products, there may be no effective legal recourse against duplication by competitors. In addition, in the future, we may have to rely on litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights, protect our trade secrets, determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or defend against claims of infringement or invalidity. Any such litigation, whether successful or unsuccessful, could result in substantial costs to us and diversions of our resources, either of which could adversely affect our business. Any infringement by us on patent rights of others could result in litigation and adversely affect our ability to continue to provide, or increase the cost of providing, our products and electronic execution services. Patents of third parties may have an important bearing on our ability to offer certain of our products and services. Our competitors as well as other companies and individuals may obtain, and may be expected to obtain in the future, patents related to the types of products and services we offer or plan to offer. We cannot assure you that we are or will be aware of all patents containing claims that may pose a risk of infringement by our products and services. In addition, some patent applications in the United States are confidential until a patent is issued and, therefore, we cannot evaluate the extent to which our products and services may be covered or asserted to be covered by claims contained in pending patent applications. These claims of infringement are not uncommon in our industry. In general, if one or more of our products or services were to infringe on patents held by others, we may be required to stop developing or marketing the products or services, to obtain licenses to develop and market the services from the holders of the patents or to redesign the products or services in such a way as to avoid infringing on the patent claims. We cannot assess the extent to which we may be required in the future to obtain licenses with respect to patents held by others, whether such licenses would be available or, if available, whether we would be able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms. If we were unable to obtain such licenses, we may not be able to redesign our products or services to avoid infringement, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. RISKS RELATING TO AN INVESTMENT IN OUR CLASS A COMMON STOCK Our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and operations and prevent us from fulfilling our debt service obligations. We may still be able to incur more debt, intensifying these risks. As of December 31, 2009, we had approximately $2.3 billion of total indebtedness and we had excess borrowing capacity for general corporate purposes under our existing facilities of approximately $0.8 billion. Our indebtedness could have important consequences. For example, our indebtedness may: • require us to dedicate a significant portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt, thereby reducing the availability of cash flow to fund capital expenditures, pursue acquisitions or investments, to pay dividends and for general corporate purposes; • increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic conditions; • limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in or challenges relating to our business and industry; 44 • place us at a competitive disadvantage against any less leveraged competitors; and • subject us to interest rate exposure for our variable interest rate debt, to the extent not hedged. The occurrence of any one of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, prospects, and ability to satisfy our debt service obligations. In addition, the agreements governing our outstanding indebtedness do not significantly limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness, which could increase the risks described above to the extent that we incur additional debt. Any reduction in our credit rating could increase the cost of our funding from the capital markets. Our long-term debt is currently rated investment grade by two of the major rating agencies. These rating agencies regularly evaluate us. Their ratings of our long-term debt are based on a number of factors, including our financial strength as well as factors not entirely within our control, such as conditions affecting the financial services industry generally. In light of the difficulties in the financial services industry and the financial markets, there can be no assurance that we will maintain our current ratings. Our failure to maintain those ratings could adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain funding and increase our cost of capital. Our investment in BM&FBOVESPA subjects us to investment and currency risk. We own an interest in BM&FBOVESPA representing approximately 5% of its outstanding shares. As an exchange, its ability to maintain or expand its trading volume and operate its business is subject to the same types of risks to which we are subject. Additionally, its stock is valued in Brazilian real, which subjects us to currency risk. To mitigate our financial exposure to the currency risk of the investment, we purchased an option to hedge against fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and the Brazilian real with Lehman Brothers Special Financing Inc. As a result of the bankruptcy filing of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. in September 2008, our hedging arrangement was terminated and our currency exposure is no longer mitigated. There is no guarantee that our investment in BM&FBOVESPA will be profitable. Under the terms of the transaction, we may not sell our shares in BM&FBOVESPA until February 2012. Any impairment of our goodwill and other intangible assets or investments may result in material, non-cash write downs and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and shareholders’ equity. In connection with our acquisitions, including our mergers with CBOT Holdings and NYMEX Holdings, we have recorded goodwill and identifiable intangible assets. We assess goodwill and intangible assets for impairment by applying a fair value test looking at historical performance, capital requirements and projected cash flows on an annual basis or more frequently if indicators of impairment arise. In 2008, we were required to record impairment charges in connection with our investment in BM&FBOVESPA and our Swapstream acquisition. In 2009, we also recorded impairment charges in connection with our ownership interests in IMAREX ASA and the Dubai Mercantile Exchange. We may continue to experience future events that result in impairments. The risk of impairment losses may increase to the extent our market capitalization and earnings decline. An impairment of the value of our existing goodwill and intangible assets could have a significant negative impact on our future operating results and could have an adverse impact on our ability to satisfy the financial ratios or other covenants under our existing or future debt agreements. Our quarterly operating results fluctuate due to seasonality. As a result, you will not be able to rely on our operating results in any particular quarter as an indication of our future performance. Generally, we have historically experienced relatively higher trading volume during the first and second quarters and sequentially lower trading volume in the third and fourth quarters. As a result of this seasonality, you will not be able to rely on our operating results in any particular period as an indication of our future performance. If we 45 fail to meet securities analysts’ expectations regarding our operating results, the price of our Class A common stock could decline substantially. Our average rate per contract is subject to fluctuation due to a number of factors. As a result, you will not be able to rely on our average rate per contract in any particular period as an indication of our future average rate per contract. Our average rate per contract, which impacts our operating results, is subject to fluctuation due to shifts in the mix of products traded, the trading venue and the mix of customers (whether the customer receives member or non-member fees or participates in one of our various incentive programs) and the impact of our tiered pricing structure. For example, we earn a higher rate per contract for trades executed electronically. In addition, our members and participants in our various incentive programs generally are charged lower fees than our non-member customers. Variation in each of these factors is difficult to predict and will have an impact on our average rate per contract in the particular period. Because of this fluctuation, you may not be able to rely on our average rate per contract in any particular period as an indication of our future average rate per contract. If we fail to meet securities analysts’ expectations regarding our operating results, the price of our Class A common stock could decline substantially. Our cost structure is largely fixed. If our revenues decline and we are unable to reduce our costs, our profitability will be adversely affected. Our cost structure is largely fixed. We base our cost structure on historical and expected levels of demand for our products and services. If demand for our products and services and our resulting revenues decline, we may not be able to adjust our cost structure on a timely basis. In that event, our profitability will be adversely affected. Shareholders who own trading rights or are officers or directors of firms who own trading rights on our exchanges account for 20 of the 32 directors on our board. These shareholders may have interests that differ from or conflict with those of shareholders who are not also members. Our dependence on the trading and clearing activities of our members, combined with their rights to elect directors, may enable them to exert substantial influence over the operation of our business. Twenty of our 32 directors on our board own or are officers or directors of firms who own trading rights on our exchange. We are dependent on the revenues from the trading and clearing activities of our members. This dependence may give them substantial influence over how we operate our business. Many of our members and clearing firms derive a substantial portion of their income from their trading or clearing activities on or through our exchanges. In addition, trading rights on our exchanges have substantial independent value. The amount of income that members derive from their trading, brokering and clearing activities and the value of their trading rights are, in part, dependent on the fees they are charged to trade, broker, clear and access our markets and the rules and structure of our markets. As a result, holders of our Class A common stock may not have the same economic interests as our members. In addition, our members may have differing interests among themselves depending on the roles they serve in our markets, their method of trading and the products they trade. Consequently, members may advocate that we enhance and protect their clearing and trading opportunities and the value of their trading privileges over their economic interest in us. The rights of our members, including the board representation rights of the members of our CME exchange to elect six directors and the rights described in the immediately following risk factor, could be used to influence how our business is changed or developed, including how we address competition and how we seek to grow our volume and revenue and enhance shareholder value. 46 Our members have been granted special rights, which protect their trading privileges, require that we maintain open outcry trading until volumes are not significant and, in the case of our Class B shareholders and CBOT members, provide them with special board representation. Under the terms of the organizational documents of our exchanges, our members have certain rights that relate primarily to trading right protections, certain trading fee protections and certain membership benefit protections. Additionally, our Class B shareholders, who are members of our CME exchange, are also entitled to elect six of the 32 directors on our board; even if their Class A share ownership interest is very small or non-existent. We are also required to include at least 10 CBOT directors (as defined in our bylaws) on our board until our 2012 annual meeting of shareholders and to submit changes to the rules and regulations of the CBOT exchange to the CBOT directors in advance for their review. In the event the CBOT directors determine in their sole discretion that a proposed rule change will materially impair the business of CBOT or the business opportunities of the holders of the CBOT memberships, such change must be submitted to a committee comprised of three CBOT directors and two CME directors (as defined in our bylaws). In connection with these rights, our ability to take certain actions that we may deem to be in the best interests of the company and its shareholders, including actions relating to the operation of our open outcry trading facilities and certain pricing decisions, may be limited by the rights of our members. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS Not applicable. ITEM 2. PROPERTIES Our corporate headquarters are located at 20 South Wacker Drive, Chicago, Illinois 60606. In 2007, we entered into a new lease at 20 South Wacker Drive, which was subsequently amended to include an expansion, providing for approximately 491,000 square feet of office, lobby and support space which includes the space that previously housed our lower trading floor space. The initial term of the lease expires in 2022 with two consecutive options to extend the term for seven and ten years, respectively. The lease also includes various expansion and contraction options. As a result of our merger with CBOT Holdings, we own three buildings located at 141 West Jackson Boulevard in Chicago, which consist of a total of approximately 1,500,000 square feet. We occupy approximately 422,000 square feet of office, trading floor and support space at this location. In connection with our acquisition of NYMEX, we own a 16-story building in downtown New York, New York. This building, which is on land leased from the Battery Park City Authority for a term expiring in June 2069, is one of five office buildings in a complex known as the World Financial Center. The construction of the 507,000 square foot building was completed in 1997 and houses open outcry trading for NYMEX and COMEX. As of December 31, 2009, approximately 155,000 square feet was leased to third parties. Our largest tenant at this location is ICE Futures U.S., Inc. (formerly known as NYBOT). We also lease additional office space at 550 West Washington in Chicago for approximately 222,000 square feet of office space on a phased-in basis through 2013, pursuant to a lease that expires in 2023. We maintain back up and remote data center locations as part of our disaster recovery initiative on property owned or leased in Illinois and New York. Our third data center was added in 2009. We also lease administrative office space in Washington, D.C.; Houston, Texas; Tokyo, Japan; Hong Kong, China; Shanghai, China; and Singapore, Singapore as well as both administrative and communication equipment space in London, England. We believe our facilities are adequate for our current operations and that additional space can be obtained if needed. 47 ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS From time to time, we are involved in legal proceedings and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we are not a party to or, to our knowledge, threatened with any litigation or other legal proceeding that, in our opinion, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition. NYMEX Holdings Merger Class Actions In connection with our merger with NYMEX Holdings, two purported class action complaints were filed against the former NYMEX Holdings, the former NYMEX Holdings board of directors and CME Group in the Delaware Court of Chancery in March 2008. One action was filed on behalf of the former NYMEX Holdings’ shareholders and the other action was brought on behalf of the NYMEX Class A members. Both actions included substantially similar claims alleging, among other things, that the NYMEX Holdings board of directors breached their fiduciary duties in approving the merger agreement by exclusively negotiating a transaction with CME Group without regard to the fairness of the transaction to the NYMEX Holdings shareholders, failing to take steps to maximize shareholder value, capping the minimum price of NYMEX Holdings’ stock, failing to properly value NYMEX Holdings, making changes to NYMEX Holdings’ change of control severance plan weeks before announcing that it was engaged in discussions with CME Group, requiring the Class A members to execute a waiver and release that allegedly was coercive because it was intended to deprive them of their rights to participate in this lawsuit as well as their rights to past, present and future royalty payments under Section 311(G) of the former bylaws of NYMEX, and failing to fully disclose material information related to the merger, including financial information and information necessary to prevent statements contained in the preliminary proxy from being misleading. The complaints further alleged that CME Group aided and abetted the alleged breach of fiduciary duties. Both actions initially sought to enjoin the merger; however, plaintiffs pulled the preliminary injunction hearing from the court’s calendar in August 2008 after becoming satisfied that there had been adequate disclosures by NYMEX Holdings and CME Group. Following the withdrawal of the injunction, the plaintiffs sought damages for alleged breaches of fiduciary duties and a declaration that the waiver and release was invalid and unenforceable. In October 2008, the defendants moved to dismiss the complaints. In September 2009, the Delaware Court of Chancery granted the defendants’ motions to dismiss the complaints. The plaintiffs’ appealed the court’s decision. Subsequently, the plaintiffs agreed in December 2009 to voluntarily withdraw their appeals in exchange for our agreement to pay the court approved attorneys fees of $1.8 million. EUREX Action In October 2003, the U.S. Futures Exchange, L.L.C. (Eurex U.S.) and U.S. Exchange Holdings, Inc. filed suit against CBOT and CME in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. The suit alleges that CBOT and CME violated the antitrust laws and tortiously interfered with the business relationship and contract between Eurex U.S. and The Clearing Corporation. Eurex U.S. and U.S. Exchange Holdings, Inc. are seeking treble damages. In December 2003, CBOT and CME filed separate motions to dismiss or, in the event the motion to dismiss is denied, to move the venue to the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. In September 2004, the judge granted CBOT’s and CME’s motion to transfer venue to the Northern District of Illinois. In light of that decision, the judge did not rule on the motions to dismiss. In March 2005, Eurex U.S. filed a second amended complaint in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. In June 2005, CME and CBOT filed a motion to dismiss the complaint which was denied in August 2005. In April 2007, CME and CBOT filed two joint motions for summary judgment. We are currently awaiting the court’s decision on the motions. Based on its investigation to date and advice from legal counsel, the company believes this suit is without merit and intends to defend itself vigorously against these charges. CBOE Class Action In August 2006, CBOT Holdings and CBOT, along with a class consisting of certain CBOT full members, filed a lawsuit in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware against the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE). 48 The lawsuit sought to enforce and protect the exercise right privileges (ERPs). The lawsuit alleged that these ERPs allowed CBOT’s full members who held them to become full members of CBOE and to participate on an equal basis with other members of CBOE in CBOE’s announced plans to demutualize. In June 2008, the parties reached a settlement in principle. Under the proposed settlement terms, CBOE participating Class A members would share in an aggregate of 18% of the CBOE Holdings equity through the issuance of warrants that will be converted into non-voting common stock of CBOE Holdings convertible into voting common stock upon CBOE Holdings’ initial public offering. Class A members would also be entitled to receive non-interest bearing notes for their pro rata share of $300.0 million. Participating Class B members would be paid $250,000 for each ERP owned. The settlement was approved by the court in July 2009 and was subsequently appealed in August. In December 2009, CBOE and CBOT reached a settlement with the appellants whereby the appellants would receive an aggregate of approximately $4.1 million, with CBOE and CBOT each contributing half of the settlement proceeds. On December 2, 2009, the Delaware Supreme Court dismissed all of the appeals and the case was concluded. Fifth Market On August 19, 2008, Fifth Market filed a complaint against CME Group and CME seeking a permanent injunction against CME’s Globex system and enhanced damages for what the plaintiff alleges is willful infringement, in addition to costs, expenses and attorneys’ fees. The suit alleges that CME infringes two U.S. patents. Based on its investigation to date and advice from legal counsel, the company believes this suit is without merit and intends to defend itself vigorously against these charges. Garber In June 2009, CME and CBOT filed a complaint against Howard Garber seeking a declaratory judgment that neither CME nor CBOT was infringing certain of Mr. Garber’s patents and that one of his patents is invalid and unenforceable. In September 2009, Technology Research Group LLC, the current owner of one of the patents at issue, filed counterclaims alleging that CME and CBOT infringe, induce or contribute to the infringement and willfully infringes its patent. Technology Research is seeking an injunction and damages no less than a reasonable royalty. Based on its investigation to date and advice from legal counsel, the company believes this suit is without merit and intends to defend itself vigorously against these charges. Realtime Data In July 2009, Realtime Data LLC filed a complaint against CME Group and other exchanges seeking a permanent injunction and damages no less than a reasonable royalty. In July 2009, Realtime filed an amended complaint and added CBOT and NYMEX along with other related companies of the other defendants. The complaint alleges that CME Group, CBOT and NYMEX infringe directly and/or indirectly four patents and further that the infringement is willful. Based on its investigation to date and advice from legal counsel, the company believes this suit is without merit and intends to defend itself vigorously against these charges. ITEM 4. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS Not applicable. 49 PART II ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES Class A Common Stock Our Class A common stock is currently listed on NASDAQ under the ticker symbol “CME.” As of February 17, 2010, there were approximately 3,097 holders of record of our Class A common stock. The following table sets forth the high and low sales prices per share of our Class A common stock on a quarterly basis, as reported on NASDAQ. 2009 High Low 2008 High Low First Quarter $ 264.43 $ 155.06 First Quarter $ 686.43 $ 399.01 Second Quarter 346.24 215.30 Second Quarter 526.98 375.38 Third Quarter 315.00 255.00 Third Quarter 422.24 282.00 Fourth Quarter 343.67 281.61 Fourth Quarter 440.00 155.49 Class B Common Stock Our Class B common stock is not listed on a national securities exchange or traded in an organized over-the-counter market. Each class of our Class B common stock is associated with a membership in a specific division of our CME exchange. CME’s rules provide exchange members with trading rights and the ability to use or lease these trading rights. Each share of our Class B common stock can be transferred only in connection with the transfer of the associated trading rights. The memberships by class are CME (Chicago Mercantile Exchange), IMM (International Monetary Market), IOM (Index and Option Market) and GEM (Growth and Emerging Markets). Class B shares and the associated trading rights are bought and sold through our shareholder relations and membership services department. In addition, trading rights may be leased through the department. Trading right sales are reported on our Web site. Although our Class B shareholders have special voting rights, because our Class B shares have the same equitable interest in our earnings and the same dividend payments as our Class A shares, we expect that the market price of our Class B common stock, if reported separately from the associated trading rights, would be determined by the value of our Class A common stock. As of February 17, 2010, there were approximately 2,470 holders of record of our Class B common stock. Dividends The following table sets forth the dividends we paid on our Class A and Class B common stock in the last two years: Record Date Dividend per Share Record Date Dividend per Share March 10, 2009 $ 1.15 March 10, 2008 $ 1.15 June 10, 2009 1.15 June 10, 2008 1.15 September 10, 2009 1.15 September 10, 2008 1.15 December 10, 2009 1.15 September 25, 2008 5.00 * December 10, 2008 1.15 * The September 25, 2008 dividend was a special dividend. We intend to continue to pay a regular quarterly dividend to our shareholders. The decision to pay a dividend, however, remains within the discretion of our board of directors and may be affected by various factors, 50 including our earnings, financial condition, capital requirements, levels of indebtedness and other considerations our board of directors deems relevant. In 2009, our dividend remained at $1.15 per share. For 2010, our quarterly dividend target is expected to remain at this level. On February 2, 2010, the board of directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of $1.15 per share payable on March 25, 2010, to shareholders of record on March 10, 2010. Assuming no changes in the number of shares outstanding, the 2010 dividend payment will total approximately $76.6 million. The indentures governing our floating and fixed rate notes, our 364-day credit facility for $1.0 billion and our revolving credit and term loan agreement for $1.4 billion due 2011 do not contain specific covenants that restrict the ability to pay dividends. These documents, however, do contain other customary financial and operating covenants that place restrictions on the operations of the company, which could indirectly affect the ability to pay dividends. For example, under our revolving credit and term loan agreement, we are required to remain in compliance with a consolidated net worth test, defined as our consolidated shareholders’ equity as of June 30, 2008 on a pro forma basis to give effect to the NYMEX Holdings merger and to give effect to the share repurchases made and special dividends paid, but only up to the amount of such repurchases and dividends publicly announced and made or paid within 18 months after August 22, 2008 (and in no event greater than $1.5 billion in the aggregate for such repurchases and dividends), multiplied by 0.65. In addition, our 364-day revolving line of credit contains a requirement that CME remain in compliance with a consolidated tangible net worth test, defined as consolidated shareholder’s equity less intangible assets (as defined in the agreement), of not less than $125 million. In the event that CME elects to increase the facility, the minimum consolidated tangible net worth test will increase ratably up to $187.5 million. CME Group, as a holding company, has no operations of its own. Instead, it relies on dividends declared and paid to it by its subsidiaries, including CME, in order to provide a portion of the funds which it uses to pay dividends to its shareholders. CME Group and its subsidiaries are also required to comply with restrictions contained in the General Corporation Laws of its state of incorporation which could also limit its (or their) ability to declare and pay dividends. 51 PERFORMANCE GRAPH The following graph compares the cumulative five-year total return provided shareholders on our Class A common stock relative to the cumulative total returns of the S&P 500 index, and a customized peer group that includes IntercontinentalExchange, Inc., NYSE Euronext and The Nasdaq OMX Group Inc. as of the end of the year. An investment of $100 (with reinvestment of all dividends) is assumed to have been made in our Class A common stock, in the peer group, and the index on December 31, 2004 and its relative performance is tracked through December 31, 2009.

The aggregate value of the transaction was $25.1 million. The shares of Class A common stock were issued in an unregistered transaction in reliance on Section 4(2) of the Securities Act and are subject to transfer restrictions that will expire over the next four years with one fourth of the shares being released on an annual basis. On February 26, 2008, we issued 1.2 million shares of Class A common stock to the Brazilian Mercantile & Futures Exchange valued at $631.4 million in exchange for an equity interest of approximately 10% in the Brazilian Mercantile & Futures Exchange. The shares of Class A common stock were issued in an unregistered transaction in reliance on Section 4(2) of the Securities Act. Subsequent to this investment, the Brazilian Mercantile & Futures Exchange merged with Bovespa Holdings S.A. to become BM&FBOVESPA and our equity stake was reduced to approximately 5%. Neither party may sell its equity interest in the other until February 2012 under the provisions of our agreement.

(2) In June 2008, the board previously authorized a program to purchase shares of our Class A common stock with a value of up to $1.1 billion, subject to market conditions over an 18-month period. In the first quarter of 2009, we suspended the purchase of shares under the program in order to focus on paying down debt. This share buyback program expired during the month of December. On February 11, 2010, the company announced that its board had approved a plan to repurchase up to 2.35 million shares of its Class A common stock. This buyback program is not subject to an expiration period. ITEM 6. SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA On July 12, 2007, CBOT Holdings, Inc. (CBOT Holdings) merged with and into Chicago Mercantile Exchange Holdings Inc. (CME Holdings). At the time of this merger, the combined company was renamed CME Group Inc. (CME Group). On March 23, 2008, CME Group acquired Credit Market Analysis Ltd., a private company incorporated in the United Kingdom, and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (collectively, CMA). On August 22, 2008, NYMEX Holdings, Inc. (NYMEX Holdings) merged with CME Group. 53 The following data includes the financial results of CBOT Holdings beginning July 13, 2007, the financial results of CMA beginning March 24, 2008, and the financial results of NYMEX Holdings beginning August 23, 2008.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS INTRODUCTION Our Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is organized as follows: • Overview: Includes a discussion of our business structure; current economic and industry-wide trends relevant to our business; our current business strategy; and our primary sources of operating and non-operating revenues and expenditures. • Critical Accounting Policies: Provides an explanation of accounting policies which may have a significant impact on our financial results and the estimates, assumptions and risks associated with those policies. • Recent Accounting Pronouncements: Includes an evaluation of recent accounting pronouncements and the potential impact of their future adoption on our financial results. • Results of Operations: Includes a discussion of our 2009, 2008 and 2007 financial results and any known events or trends which are likely to impact future results. • Liquidity and Capital Resources: Includes a discussion of our future cash requirements, capital resources, significant planned expenditures and financing arrangements. On July 12, 2007, CBOT Holdings, Inc. (CBOT Holdings) merged with and into Chicago Mercantile Exchange Holdings Inc. (CME Holdings). At the time of this merger, the combined company was renamed CME Group Inc. (CME Group). On March 23, 2008, CME Group acquired Credit Market Analysis Ltd., a private company incorporated in the United Kingdom, and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (collectively, CMA). On August 22, 2008, NYMEX Holdings, Inc. (NYMEX Holdings) merged with CME Group. The following Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations includes the financial results of the former CBOT Holdings beginning July 13, 2007, the financial results of CMA beginning March 24, 2008, and the financial results of the former NYMEX Holdings beginning August 23, 2008. References in this discussion and analysis to “we” and “our” are to CME Group and its consolidated subsidiaries, collectively. References to “exchange” are to Chicago Mercantile Exchange Inc. (CME), Board of Trade of the City of Chicago, Inc. (CBOT) and New York Mercantile Exchange, Inc. (NYMEX), collectively. OVERVIEW Business Structure CME Group, a Delaware stock corporation, is the holding company for CME, CBOT, NYMEX and their respective subsidiaries. The holding company structure is designed to provide strategic and operational flexibility. CME Group’s Class A common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market (NASDAQ) under the ticker symbol “CME.” Our exchange consists of designated contract markets for the trading of futures and options on futures contracts. Futures contracts and options on futures contracts provide investors with vehicles for protecting against, and potentially profiting from, price changes in financial instruments and physical commodities. We are a global exchange with customer access available virtually all over the world. Our customers consist of professional traders, financial institutions, individual and institutional investors, major corporations, manufacturers, producers and governments. Customers include both members of the exchange and non-members. We offer our customers the opportunity to trade futures contracts and options on futures contracts on a range of products including those based on interest rates, equities, foreign exchange, commodities, energy, and metals. 55 Our products provide a means for hedging, speculating and allocating assets. We identify new products by monitoring economic trends and their impact on the risk management and speculative needs of our existing and prospective customers. Our major product lines are traded through our electronic trading platforms and our open outcry trading floors. These execution facilities offer our customers immediate trade execution and price transparency. In addition, trades can be executed through privately negotiated transactions that are cleared and settled through our clearing house. Our clearing house clears, settles and guarantees every futures and options contract traded through our exchange, in addition to over-the-counter products cleared through CME ClearPort. Our clearing house performance guarantee is an important function of our business. Because of this guarantee, our customers do not need to evaluate the credit of each potential counterparty or limit themselves to a selected set of counterparties. This flexibility increases the potential liquidity available for each trade. Additionally, the substitution of our clearing house as the counterparty to every transaction allows our customers to establish a position with one party and then to offset the position with another party. This contract offsetting process provides our customers with flexibility in establishing and adjusting positions and provides for performance bond efficiencies. To ensure performance of counterparties, we establish and monitor financial requirements for our clearing firms and mark-to-market their positions typically twice a day. We also set minimum performance bond requirements for our traded products, over-the-counter products and cleared credit default swaps. In the unlikely event of a payment default by a clearing firm, we would first apply assets of that clearing firm to cover its payment obligation. These assets include security deposits, performance bonds and any other available assets, such as the proceeds from the sale of pledged Class A and Class B common stock and associated trading rights of the clearing firm at our exchange that are owned by or assigned to the clearing firm. In addition, we would make a demand for payment pursuant to any applicable guarantee provided to the exchange by the parent company of a clearing firm. Thereafter, if the payment default remains unsatisfied, we would use, in order, CME’s surplus funds, security deposits of other clearing firms and funds collected through an assessment against all other solvent clearing firms to satisfy the deficit. Industry Trends Economic Environment. Our markets provide an effective and transparent means for our customers to manage risk despite the economic downturn. We have experienced a decline in trading activity in the markets in which we participate due to ongoing instability in the financial markets, a decrease in the availability of credit and a decline in assets under management. Our goal is to continue to maintain quality products and services in support of our customers while they operate within the current economic environment. Competitive Environment. The industry in which we operate is highly competitive and we expect competition to continue to intensify. We encounter competition in all aspects of our business, including from entities having substantially greater capital and resources and offering a wider range of products and services and some operating under a different and possibly less stringent regulatory regime. We now face competition from other futures, securities and securities option exchanges; over-the-counter markets; clearing organizations; consortia formed by our members and large market participants; alternative trade execution facilities; technology firms, including market data distributors and electronic trading system developers; and others. Regulatory Environment. Our operations as a futures exchange have historically been subject to extensive regulation. In light of widespread difficulties across the economy, particularly acute in the latter half of 2008 and early 2009, there have been many calls for a restructuring of the regulation of financial markets. As a result, various legislative proposals are currently circulating in Congress outlining regulatory reform in the futures and over-the-counter derivatives markets. We cannot predict what the final regulations will be or what impact they may have on our business. To the extent the regulatory environment is less beneficial for us or our customers, our business, financial condition and operating results could be negatively affected. 56 Business Strategy Our strategy is directed towards leveraging our benchmark products, clearing and trading technologies, the benefits derived from our integrated clearing house as well as our scalable infrastructure. We strive to capitalize on opportunities created by increased market awareness and acceptance of derivatives, increased price volatility, technological advances and the increasing need for counterparty risk mitigation and clearing services. This strategy allows us to continue to develop into a more broadly diversified financial exchange that provides trading and clearing solutions across a wide range of products and asset classes. We believe that we can build on our competitive strengths by implementing the following strategies: • Grow our core business through diversification of our customer base and extension of our current product lines; • Globalize our business by targeting international customers through strategic investments and by leveraging our diverse product offerings; and • Serve the over-the-counter markets through the continued development of products and services and by exploring opportunities for acquisitions, alliances and commercial agreements. Primary Sources of Revenue Clearing and transaction fees. A majority of our revenue is derived from clearing and transaction fees, which include electronic trading fees, surcharges for privately-negotiated transactions and other volume-related charges for contracts executed through our trading venues. Because clearing and transaction fees are assessed on a per-contract basis, revenues and profitability fluctuate with changes in trading volume. In addition to the industry trends noted earlier, our revenues and trading volume tend to increase during periods of economic and geopolitical uncertainty. This is because our customers seek to manage their exposure to, or speculate on, the market volatility resulting from uncertainty. However, in 2008 and 2009, we believe the extreme volatility and the decoupling of related markets have reduced customers’ ability to assume and maintain positions, which has resulted in a decrease in volume. In addition, our volume can be seasonal, and historically, we have experienced higher sequential volume during the first and second quarters followed by decreases in the third and fourth quarters of the calendar year. However, these patterns may be altered by the impact of economic and political events, the launch of new products, mergers and acquisitions as well as other factors. While volume has the most significant impact on our clearing and transaction fees revenue, there are four other factors that also influence the source of revenues: • rate structure; • product mix; • trading venue; and • the percentage of trades executed by customers who are members compared with non-member customers. Rate structure. Customers benefit from volume discounts and limits on fees as part of our effort to increase liquidity in certain products. We may periodically change fees, volume discounts, limits on fees and member discounts, perhaps significantly, based on our review of operations and the business environment. As a result of their rate structure, Total Return Asset Contracts (TRAKRS), Swapstream products, Hurricane Risk Landfall Option (HuRLO) contracts and auction-traded products are excluded from disclosures of trading volume and average rate per contract in this discussion and analysis. Clearing and transaction fees on these products are immaterial relative to our other products. TRAKRS are exchange-traded non-traditional futures contracts that trade electronically on the CME Globex electronic platform. Auction-traded products, which included CME economic derivatives, were previously traded through July 2007. Swapstream products were previously traded through September 2008. 57 Product mix. We offer trading of futures and options on futures contracts on a wide-ranging set of products based on interest rates, equities, foreign exchange, commodities, energy and metals. Rates are varied by product in order to optimize revenue on existing products and support introduction of new products to encourage trading volume. Trading venue. Our exchange is an international marketplace that brings together buyers and sellers mainly through our electronic trading platforms as well as through open outcry trading on our trading floors and privately negotiated transactions. Any customer guaranteed by a clearing firm and who agrees to be bound by our exchange rules is able to obtain direct access to our electronic platforms. Open outcry trading is conducted exclusively by our members, who may execute trades on behalf of customers or for themselves. Typically, customers executing trades through our electronic platforms are charged fees for using the platform in addition to the fees assessed on all transactions executed on our exchange. Customers entering into privately negotiated transactions also incur additional charges beyond the fees assessed on all transactions. Member/non-member mix. Generally, member customers are charged lower fees than our non-member customers. Holding all other factors constant, revenue decreases if the percentage of trades executed by members increases, and increases if the percentage of non-member trades increases. Quotation data fees. We receive revenue from the dissemination of our market data to subscribers. Our market data services are provided primarily through third-party distributors. Subscribers can obtain access to real-time, delayed and end-of-day quotation, trade and summary market data for our products. Users of our basic service receive real-time quotes and pay a flat monthly fee for each screen, or device, displaying our market data. Alternatively, customers can subscribe to market data provided on a limited group of products. The fee for this service is also a flat rate per month. Pricing for our market data services is based on the value of the service provided, our cost structure for the service and the price of comparable services offered by our competitors. Increases or decreases in our quotation data fees revenue is influenced by changes in our price structure for existing market data offerings, introduction of new market data services and changes in the number of devices in use. General economic factors that affect the financial services industry, which constitutes our primary customer base, also influence revenue from our market data services. Processing services. To further diversify the range of services we offer, we have entered into clearing and transaction processing agreements with third parties. Prior to our merger with NYMEX Holdings in August 2008, we collected fees for listing energy and metal futures products on the CME Globex platform. Prior to our merger with CBOT Holdings in July 2007, we collected fees for clearing services for CBOT products. Our processing services revenues with NYMEX and CBOT ended upon the completion of our mergers with each entity. Additionally, we provided clearing and risk management services for trades executed at FXMarketSpace Limited (FXMS), our joint venture with Thomson Reuters Group PLC (Reuters), beginning in 2007 until FXMS terminated operations in the fourth quarter of 2008. Other sources. Other sources of revenue include access and communication fees and revenue from various services related to our operations. • Access and communication fees are the connectivity charges to customers of the CME Globex platform to our market data vendors and to direct market data customers as well as charges to members and clearing firms that utilize our various telecommunications networks and communications services. Access fee revenue varies depending on the type of connection provided to customers. Revenue from communication fees is largely dependent on open outcry trading, as a significant portion relates to telecommunications on our trading floors. 58 • Other revenues include rent charged to third party tenants as well as ancillary charges for utilities, parking and miscellaneous services provided to tenants. We maintain three commercial buildings in Chicago’s central business district. The retail and office space is rented primarily to third party tenants, including exchange customers. As part of our merger with NYMEX Holdings, we also acquired office space in New York City that is rented to third party tenants. All tenants pay market rates for rent. Revenues related to our real estate operations are generally affected by market rental rates, lease renewals and business conditions in the financial services industry in which most of our tenants operate. Additionally, other revenues include fees for administrating our Interest Earnings Facility (IEF) program, trade order routing, and various services to members and clearing firms. We offer clearing firms the opportunity to invest cash performance bonds in our various IEF offerings. These clearing firms receive interest income, and we receive a fee based on total funds on deposit. In addition, other revenues include trading gains and losses generated by GFX Corporation (GFX), our wholly-owned subsidiary that trades primarily in foreign exchange futures contracts to enhance liquidity in our electronic markets for these products. Primary Expenses Most of our expenses do not vary directly with changes in our trading volume, except licensing and other fee agreements and the majority of our employee bonuses. Compensation and benefits. Compensation and benefits expense is our most significant expense and includes employee wages, bonuses, stock-based compensation, benefits and employer taxes. Changes in this expense are driven by fluctuations in the number of employees, increases in wages as a result of inflation or labor market conditions, changes in rates for employer taxes and other cost increases affecting benefit plans. In addition, this expense is affected by the composition of our work force. The expense associated with our bonus and stock-based compensation plans can also have a significant impact on this expense category and may vary from year to year. The bonus component of our compensation and benefits expense is based on our financial performance. Under the performance criteria of our annual incentive plans, the bonus funded under the plans would be the “target” level if we achieve the cash earnings target established by the compensation committee of our board of directors. Cash earnings are defined as net income less capital expenditures and exclude tax-effected amortization of purchased intangibles, depreciation and amortization expense, tax-effected stock-based compensation expense, valuation losses on investments, tax adjustments and net interest income (expense). Under the plan, if our actual cash earnings equal 80% of the established target for a given year, the bonus will be reduced by approximately 50% of the target bonus amount. There will be no bonus if our cash earnings are less than 80% of the cash earnings target, other than for non-exempt employees who may receive a bonus under our discretionary bonus program. If our actual cash earnings equal 120% of the target or higher, the bonus is increased by approximately 50% from the targeted bonus amount, which is the maximum amount established by the compensation committee. If our performance is between the threshold performance level of 80% of the cash earnings target and the maximum performance level of 120% of the cash earnings target, the bonus will be calculated based on the level of performance achieved. The compensation committee may adjust the cash earnings calculation and the target level of performance for material, unplanned revenue, expense or capital expenditures to meet intermediate to long-term growth opportunities. The cash earnings calculation for bonus purposes excludes items as approved at the discretion of the compensation committee. Stock-based compensation is a non-cash expense related to stock options and restricted stock grants. Stock-based compensation varies depending on the quantity and fair value of options granted. Fair value is derived using the Black-Scholes model with assumptions about our dividend yield, the expected volatility of our stock price based on an analysis of implied and historical volatility, the risk-free interest rate and the expected life of the options granted. 59 Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense results from the depreciation of long-lived assets purchased, as well as the amortization of purchased and internally developed software. As a result of our merger with CBOT Holdings, we acquired three commercial buildings. Depreciation and amortization on the building and building improvements as well as other furniture, fixtures and equipment acquired in the merger has been recorded since the merger closed on July 12, 2007. We also acquired a commercial building in our merger with NYMEX Holdings. Depreciation and amortization on this building and building improvements, hardware and software have been recorded since the merger closed on August 22, 2008. Amortization of purchased intangibles. This expense primarily includes amortization of intangible assets obtained in our mergers with CBOT Holdings and NYMEX Holdings as well as other asset and business acquisitions. Intangible assets subject to amortization consist primarily of customer relationships, licensing agreements, and lease-related intangible assets. Other expenses. We incur additional ongoing expenses for communications, technology support services and various other activities necessary to support our operations. • Communications expense consists primarily of costs for network connections to our electronic trading platforms and some market data customers; telecommunications costs of our exchange; and fees paid for access to external market data. This expense is affected primarily by the growth of electronic trading, our capacity requirements and by changes in the number of telecommunications hubs and connections which allow customers outside the United States access to our electronic trading platforms directly. • Technology support services consist of costs related to maintenance of the hardware and software required to support our technology. Our technology support services costs are driven by system capacity, functionality and redundancy requirements. • Professional fees and outside services expense includes costs of consulting services provided for major strategic and technology initiatives as well as legal and accounting fees. This expense fluctuates primarily as a result of changes in services required to complete initiatives and legal proceedings. • Occupancy and building operations expense consists of costs related to leased and owned property including rent, maintenance, real estate taxes, utilities and other related costs. Our office space is located primarily in Chicago and New York City with smaller offices located in Washington, D.C., Houston, London, Tokyo, Hong Kong, Shanghai, and Singapore. Additionally, we have trading facilities in Chicago and New York City as well as data centers in various U.S. locations. • Licensing and other fee agreements expense consists primarily of license fees paid as a result of trading volume in equity index products, and royalty and broker rebates on metals and energy products, subsequent to the merger with NYMEX Holdings. This expense fluctuates with changes in equity index products and CME ClearPort trading volumes and fee structure changes in the agreements. • Restructuring expense consists primarily of transitional employees’ severance, retention bonuses and associated payroll taxes as well as outplacement costs and post-employment healthcare subsidies resulting from our mergers with CBOT Holdings in July 2007 and with NYMEX Holdings in August 2008. • Other expenses includes marketing-related as well as general and administrative costs. Marketing, advertising and public relations expense consists primarily of media, print and other advertising costs, as well as costs associated with our brand campaign and product promotion. 60 Non-Operating Income and Expenses Income and expenses incurred through activities outside of our core operations are considered non-operating. These activities include investments in debt and equity securities for both short-term and long-term strategic purposes and our securities lending program as well as financing activities. • Investment income represents income generated by short-term investment of excess cash, clearing firms’ cash performance bonds and security deposits; income and net realized gains and losses from our marketable securities; gains and losses on trading securities in our non-qualified deferred compensation plans and dividend income. Investment income is influenced by the availability of funds generated by operations, market interest rates and changes in the levels of cash performance bonds deposited by clearing firms. • We use derivative financial instruments for the purpose of hedging exposures to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. Any ineffective or excluded portion of our hedges is recognized in earnings immediately. • Under the securities lending program, we lend a portion of the securities that clearing firms deposit with us and we receive collateral in the form of cash in return. The cash is invested in either bank money market mutual funds, overnight repurchase agreements, corporate debt securities or other asset-back securities to generate interest income. The balance of securities on deposit fluctuates as a result of changes in the clearing firms’ open positions and how clearing firms elect to satisfy their performance bond requirements. Securities lending interest expense represents the payment to the borrower of the security for the cash retained during the duration of the lending transaction. Net interest income from securities lending is impacted by changes in short-term interest rates and the level of demand for the securities on deposit. CME’s securities lending program has been suspended since November 2008. NYMEX’s securities lending program was terminated in June 2009. • Interest and other borrowing costs are associated with various short-term and long-term funding facilities. In 2007, we initiated a commercial paper program with various financial institutions to fund a tender offer to repurchase Class A common stock. In 2008, we issued short-term and long-term debt in conjunction with our merger with NYMEX Holdings. In early 2009, we refinanced part of the debt that was previously issued for the NYMEX Holdings merger. Our debt balances primarily have fixed rates or floating rates that are fixed through the use of interest rate swaps, but some debt-related costs fluctuate with the funding needs of our business. • Income (expense) related to our guarantee of exercise right privileges (ERPs) is a result of our merger with CBOT Holdings. Under the terms of the merger agreement, eligible holders of Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) ERPs could elect to sell us their ERP for $250,000 per privilege. Eligible holders that did not elect to sell their ERPs were entitled to a maximum guaranteed payment of $250,000 from us upon resolution of the lawsuit between CBOT and CBOE. This income (expense) represents the change in estimated fair value of our guarantee during the period, which is based in part on the expected outcome of the litigation. It also includes adjustments to the value of our asset for the 159 ERPs that we hold. This litigation was resolved in December 2009. • Equity in losses of unconsolidated subsidiaries primarily includes losses from our investments in Dubai Mercantile Exchange (DME), FXMS, Green Exchange Holdings, LLC and OneChicago LLC (OneChicago). Our investment in DME was acquired with the assets of NYMEX Holdings as part of our merger in August 2008. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The notes to our consolidated financial statements include disclosure of our significant accounting policies. In establishing these policies within the framework of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, management must make certain assessments, estimates and choices that will result in the application of these 61 principles in a manner that appropriately reflects our financial condition and results of operations. Critical accounting policies are those policies that we believe present the most complex or subjective measurements and have the most potential to affect our financial position and operating results. While all decisions regarding accounting policies are important, there are certain accounting policies that we consider to be critical. These critical policies, which are presented in detail in the notes to our consolidated financial statements, relate to valuation of financial instruments, goodwill and intangible assets, derivative instruments, revenue recognition, income taxes, internal use software costs, and stock-based compensation. Valuation of financial instruments. In January 2008, we adopted the accounting guidance on fair value measurements, which provides direction for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities by defining fair value and establishing a framework for measuring fair value. The accounting guidance on fair value measurements applies to all financial instruments that are measured and reported on a fair value basis. The accounting guidance on fair value measurements defines “fair value” as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, or an exit price. The guidance establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the observable inputs be used when available. Observable inputs are inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on market data obtained from independent sources. Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect our assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances. We have categorized our financial instruments measured at fair value into a three-level classification in accordance with the guidance. The hierarchy is categorized into three levels based on the reliability of inputs as follows: • Level 1—Inputs are unadjusted, quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date. Assets and liabilities carried at level 1 fair value generally include U.S. Treasury and Government agency securities, equity securities listed in active markets, and investments in publicly traded mutual funds with quoted market prices. • Level 2—Inputs are either directly or indirectly observable and corroborated by market data or are based on quoted prices in markets that are not active. Assets and liabilities carried at level 2 fair value generally include municipal bonds, corporate debt and certain derivatives. • Level 3—Inputs are unobservable and reflect management’s best estimate of what market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. Generally assets and liabilities at fair value utilizing level 3 inputs include certain complex over-the-counter derivative contracts and certain other assets and liabilities with inputs that require management’s judgment. For further discussion regarding the fair value of financial assets and liabilities, see note 24 in the notes to consolidated financial statements. Goodwill and intangible assets. According to guidance on goodwill and other intangible assets, we review goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment on an annual basis and whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. The provisions of the guidance require that a two-step impairment test be performed on goodwill. In the first step, the fair value of each reporting unit is compared to its carrying amount. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying amount, no impairment exists and we are not required to perform further testing. If the carrying amount exceeds its fair value, the second step must be performed to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill. If the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, then an impairment loss is recorded in an amount equal to that excess. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. Valuation techniques we use to measure fair value 62 include the market approach and the income approach. The market approach encompasses comparable data sets within our peer group, and the income approach includes discounted cash flow measurements using a market discount rate. Our valuation techniques could yield variable results based on changes in assumptions such as the discount rate and long-term growth rate and forecasted revenue and expense. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are assessed for impairment by comparing their fair values to their carrying values. If the carrying value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the difference. Intangible assets subject to amortization are also evaluated for impairment when indicated by a change in circumstances, pursuant to accounting guidance on impairments or disposal of long-lived assets. The impairment testing requires management to estimate the fair value of the assets and record an impairment loss for the excess of the carrying value over the fair value. The estimate of the fair value of all intangible assets is generally determined on the basis of discounted future cash flows. In estimating the fair value, management must make assumptions and projections regarding such items as future cash flows, future revenues, future earnings and other factors. Such assumptions are subject to change as a result of changing economic and competitive conditions. Derivative investments. We use derivative financial instruments for the purpose of hedging exposures to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. Derivatives are recorded at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets according to accounting guidance for derivative instruments and hedging activities. The guidance also requires that changes in our derivatives’ fair values be recognized in earnings, unless the instruments are accounted for as hedges. For a derivative designated as a fair value hedge, any gain or loss on the derivative is recognized in earnings in the period of change, to the extent the hedge is effective, together with the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the risk being hedged. We record the effective portions of our derivative financial instruments that are designated as cash flow hedges in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. When the hedged item affects earnings, the gain or loss included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) is transferred to the same line in the consolidated statements of income as the hedged item. Any ineffective or excluded portion of a hedge is recognized in earnings immediately. Any realized gains and losses from hedges are classified in the consolidated statements of income consistent with the accounting treatment of the items being hedged. Revenue recognition. Our revenue recognition policies comply with accounting guidance on revenue recognition. Our revenue is derived primarily from the clearing and transaction fees we assess on each contract executed through our trading venues and cleared through our clearing house. Clearing and transaction fees are recognized as revenue when a buy and sell order are matched and when the trade is cleared. On occasion, the customer’s exchange trading privileges may not be properly entered by the clearing firm and incorrect fees are charged for the transactions in the affected accounts. When this information is corrected within the time period allowed by the exchange, a fee adjustment is provided to the clearing firm. An accrual is established for estimated fee adjustments to reflect corrections to customer exchange trading privileges. The accrual is based on the historical pattern of adjustments processed as well as specific adjustment requests. Occasionally market data customers will pay for services in a lump sum payment. When these circumstances occur, revenue is recognized as services are provided. Income taxes. Calculation of the income tax provision includes an estimate of the income taxes that will be paid for the current year as well as an estimate of income tax liabilities or benefits deferred into future years, as defined by accounting guidance on income taxes and accounting for uncertain tax positions. As required, our deferred tax assets are reviewed to determine if all assets will be realized in future periods. To the extent it is determined that some deferred tax assets may not be fully realized, the assets must be reduced by a valuation allowance. The calculation of our tax provision involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. We recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the United States and other applicable tax jurisdictions using a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold based on the technical merits of the tax position taken or expected to be taken. If payment of these amounts varies from our estimate, our income tax provision would be reduced or increased at the time that determination is made. This determination may not 63 be known for several years. Past tax audits have not resulted in tax adjustments that would result in a material change to the income tax provision in the year the audit was completed. The effective tax rate, defined as the income tax provision as a percentage of income before income taxes, will vary from year to year based on changes to tax rates and regulations. In addition, the effective tax rate will vary with changes to income that are not subject to income tax, such as municipal interest income, and changes in expenses or losses that are not deductible, such as the utilization of foreign net operating losses. Internal use software costs. Certain costs for employees and consultants that are incurred in connection with work on development or implementation of software for our internal use are capitalized in accordance with accounting guidance for software development costs. Costs capitalized are for application development or implementation, as required by the accounting guidance, for software projects that will result in significant new functionality and that are generally expected to cost in excess of $0.5 million. The amount capitalized is determined based on the time spent by the individuals completing the eligible software-related activity and the compensation and benefits or consulting fees incurred for these activities. Projects are monitored during the development cycle to assure that they continue to meet the capitalization criteria of the accounting guidance and that the project will be completed and placed in service as intended. Any previously capitalized costs are expensed at the time a decision is made to abandon a software project. Completed internal use software projects, as well as work-in-progress projects, are included as part of property in the consolidated balance sheets. Once complete, the accumulated costs for a particular software project are amortized over the anticipated life of the software, generally three years. Costs capitalized for internal use software will vary from year to year based on our technology-related business requirements. Stock-based compensation. We expense stock options using the fair value method under the provisions of the accounting guidance on share-based payments. We have elected the accelerated method for recognizing the expense related to stock grants. Due to this election and the vesting provisions of our stock grants, a greater percentage of the total expense is recognized in the first and second years of the vesting period than would be recorded if we used the straight-line method. We include an estimate of expected forfeitures of stock grants in our expense recognition calculations. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In June 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued guidance that changes the analysis required to determine whether a variable interest gives a company a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity. This change may result in the consolidation of entities that we currently do not consolidate and requires an ongoing reassessment of the consolidation requirement. In addition, enhanced disclosures are required that will provide the readers of financial statements with more transparent information about a company’s involvement in a variable interest entity. This standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2009. We believe the impact of this standard’s adoption will be immaterial to our consolidated financial statements. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 2009 Financial Highlights The comparability of our operating results for the periods presented is significantly impacted by our mergers with CBOT Holdings and NYMEX Holdings in July 2007 and August 2008, respectively. In the discussion and analysis that follows, we have quantified the incremental revenue or expense resulting from these transactions wherever such amounts were material and identifiable. While identified amounts may provide indications of general trends, the analysis cannot completely address the effects attributable to integration efforts. 64 The following summarizes significant changes in our financial performance for the periods presented. Year-over-Year Change (dollars in millions, except per share data) 2009 2008 2007 2009-2008 2008-2007 Total revenues $ 2,612.8 $ 2,561.0 $ 1,756.1 2 % 46 % Total expenses 1,023.7 978.8 704.2 5 39 Operating margin 61 % 62 % 60 % Non-operating income (expense) $ (151.6 ) $ (334.2 ) $ 43.9 (55 ) n.m. Effective tax rate 43 % 43 % 40 % Net income $ 825.8 $ 715.5 $ 658.5 15 9 Diluted earnings per common share 12.41 12.13 14.93 2 (19 ) Cash flows from operations 1,083.1 1,197.2 814.4 (10 ) 47 n.m. not meaningful • From 2007 to 2009, the increase in revenues was largely due to the increase in clearing and transaction fees and quotation data fees. These increases were partially offset by a decline in processing services revenues. • Increases in compensation and benefits, amortization of purchased intangibles and licensing and other fee agreements led to higher overall expenses from 2007 to 2009. • Non-operating income (expense) decreased in 2009 due to a 2008 impairment charge on our investment in BM&FBOVESPA S.A. (BM&FBOVESPA) of $274.5 million as well as impairment charges on FXMS and certain securities lending assets. This decrease in expense was partially offset by an increase in interest expense and other borrowing costs from 2007 to 2009 due to an increase in debt levels as well as 2009 impairment charges of $46.0 million related to IMAREX and DME. In addition, investment income also decreased from 2007 to 2009 due largely to a decline in rates. • The 2009 effective tax rate remained consistent with the prior year. An additional valuation allowance related to unrealized capital losses increased the effective tax rate in 2009. However, this increase was offset by the favorable impact of a New York City tax law change. In the third quarter of 2008, we recorded a charge for the impact of our new combined state and local tax rates, which was offset by the favorable impact of an Illinois tax law change in the first quarter of 2008 and an increase in our valuation allowance related to unrealized capital losses. Our effective tax rate increased in 2008 due primarily to the increase in our state and local tax rates as a result of our merger with NYMEX Holdings. • We experienced a decline in diluted earnings per share in 2008, despite improved financial performance, due to the impact of common stock issuances as a result of our mergers. • Cash flows from operations are strongly correlated with trading volume on a year-over-year basis. Revenues Year-over-Year Change (dollars in millions) 2009 2008 2007 2009-2008 2008-2007 Clearing and transactions fees $ 2,161.9 $ 2,115.4 $ 1,427.3 2 % 48 % Quotation data fees 331.1 279.5 145.1 18 93 Processing services 0.5 54.1 106.4 (99 ) (49 ) Access and communication fees 45.6 43.6 36.5 4 19 Other 73.7 68.4 40.8 8 68 Total Revenues $ 2,612.8 $ 2,561.0 $ 1,756.1 2 46 65 Clearing and Transaction Fees. Revenues increased in 2009 when compared with 2008 and in 2008 when compared with 2007 largely due to the following: Trading Volume The following table summarizes average daily trading volume. For CBOT volume information in 2007, average daily volumes have been calculated for the period from July 13 through December 31, 2007. NYMEX product and CME ClearPort services volume in 2008 have been calculated for the period from August 23 through December 31, 2008. All amounts exclude TRAKRS, Swapstream, HuRLO contracts, credit default swaps and auction-traded products. Year-over-Year Change (amounts in thousands) 2009 2008 2007 2009-2008 2008-2007 Product Line Average Daily Volume: Interest rate 4,260 6,085 7,093 (30 )% (14 )% Equity 2,916 3,663 2,744 (20 ) 33 Foreign exchange 624 623 569 — 10 Commodity 741 848 728 (13 ) 16 Energy 1,492 1,348 — 11 n.m.

Aggregate average daily volume 10,258 12,775 11,134 (20 ) 16 Electronic Volume as a Percentage of Total Volume 81 % 80 % 78 % n.m. not meaningful In 2009, when compared with 2008, the decline in average daily trading volume was largely attributable to a decrease in interest rate products and equity products volume. The addition of the NYMEX product lines in 2008 largely contributed to the increase in average daily volume from 2007 to 2008. In addition, there was a significant increase in overall market volatility in the second half of 2007 and throughout 2008, which we believe contributed to the overall increase in average daily volume from 2007 to 2008, specifically within equity products. We believe the increase in market volatility during that time period was due to concerns surrounding the subprime debt market which evolved into a credit crisis in 2008. Despite the decrease in average daily volume for interest rate products in 2008 when compared with 2007, total overall interest rate product volume increased in 2008 due to the addition of the U.S. Treasury futures and options acquired through the merger with CBOT Holdings in July 2007. In the discussion that follows, NYMEX product and CME ClearPort services volume information for the periods prior to August 23, 2008 is provided for comparative purposes only and does not correspond to revenue recognized by CME Group prior to that date. CBOT volume information for periods prior to July 13, 2007 is also provided for comparative purposes only. Interest Rate Products The overall decrease in interest rate volume from 2007 to 2009 was attributable to the credit crisis. We also believe the Federal Reserve Bank’s zero interest rate policy for short-term interest rates contributed to a decrease in volumes in 2009 when compared with 2008. 66 The following table summarizes average daily volume and changes in average daily volume relative to the prior periods for our key interest rate products. Year-over-Year Change (amounts in thousands) 2009 2008 2007 2009 - 2008 2008 - 2007 Eurodollar futures 1,736 2,360 2,456 (26 )% (4 )% Eurodollar options 639 903 1,237 (29 ) (27 ) U.S. Treasury futures and options: 10-Year 913 1,239 1,627 (26 ) (24 ) 5-Year 410 715 718 (43 ) — 30-Year 292 427 495 (32 ) (14 ) 2-Year 201 323 275 (38 ) 17 We believe that the zero interest rate policy and increased risk aversion by market participants following the credit crisis contributed to the decrease in Eurodollar futures and options from 2007 to 2009. We believe this has reduced certain customers’ ability or need to assume and maintain positions. We believe that the overall decline in U.S. Treasury note futures and options volume from 2007 to 2009 was attributable to the credit crisis, which resulted in reduced corporate debt issuances, reduced mortgage issuances and refinancing activity, a slowdown in the U.S. Treasury cash market trading as well as the Federal Reserve Bank’s purchase of U.S. Treasury securities. The decline in 2009 when compared with 2008 was also attributable to the zero interest rate policy, which we believe reduced market participants’ need to hedge interest rate risk. In 2008, when compared with 2007, we believe the credit crisis contributed to some fixed income market participants shifting from long-term debt to short-term debt, which led to a decrease in volumes for products on the long end of the yield curve relative to products on the short end of the yield curve. During the second half of 2009, overall interest rate product volume increased relative to the first half of 2009. We believe that improved economic conditions contributed to the increase in volume. Equity Products During the second half of 2007 through the first quarter of 2009, there was significant volatility in the equity markets, which we believe was attributable to concerns regarding the credit crisis. Average volatility, as measured by the CBOE Volatility Index, increased to 33% in 2008 from 18% in 2007. Average volatility decreased to 27% in the last three quarters of 2009 from 52% from the fourth quarter of 2008 through the first quarter of 2009. Average daily volume for E-mini equity products decreased by 19% to 2.6 million contracts per day in 2009 when compared with 2008. The decline in volume was primarily attributable to the decline in E-mini S&P 500 contracts, which decreased by 12% to an average of 2.3 million contracts per day when compared with 2008. Volume for the E-mini NASDAQ-100 contracts decreased by 28% to an average of 0.3 million contracts per day when compared with 2008. We believe that the decline in E-mini S&P 500 contracts and E-mini NASDAQ-100 contracts decreased due to the decline in volatility in the second quarter through the fourth quarter of 2009 when compared with the fourth quarter of 2008 and the first quarter of 2009. In addition, the decline in volume was attributable to the termination of our license to list Russell-based contracts. Volume for the Russell-based contracts averaged 0.3 million contracts per day for January 1 through September 22, 2008. In 2008, average daily volume for our E-mini equity products increased by 37% to 3.3 million contracts when compared with 2007. This increase included growth in E-mini S&P 500 contracts, which grew by 52% to an average of 2.6 million contracts per day when compared with 2007. We believe the growth in equity trading volume in 2008 when compared with 2007 was attributable to the increase in volatility. The increase was partially offset by the termination of our license to list Russell-based contracts. Volume for the Russell-based contracts was 0.3 million per day in 2007. 67 Foreign Exchange Products The following table summarizes average daily volume and changes in average daily volume relative to the prior periods for our key foreign exchange futures and options products. Year-over-Year Change (amounts in thousands) 2009 2008 2007 2009 - 2008 2008 - 2007 Euro 225 223 177 1 % 26 % British pound 100 83 84 21 — Japanese yen 93 133 125 (30 ) 6 Australian dollar 68 45 43 50 5 Canadian dollar 63 46 50 36 (8 ) We believe that the volume for our Euro products has remained flat and the Japanese yen products has declined due to the convergence of interest rates towards zero between the European, United States and Japanese markets. The increase in volume for the British pound, Australian dollar and Canadian dollar products was attributable to a divergence between interest rates in the United States and interest rates in the British, Australian and Canadian markets. Trading volume for foreign exchange products increased in 2008 when compared with 2007 due largely to increased volatility of the U.S. dollar relative to other major currencies, particularly the euro and the Japanese yen. Commodity Products We believe a decrease in market volatility and decreased demand for commodities products as a result of the credit crisis caused the overall decline in volume for commodities products in 2009 when compared with 2008. We believe the credit crisis has reduced certain customers’ ability or need to assume and maintain positions. The increase in CBOT corn and soybean products contributed to an increase in overall commodities trading volume in 2008 when compared with 2007. During 2008, volume for basic corn products increased by 17% to an average of 320,000 contracts per day. Average daily volume for basic soybean products grew by 16% to 183,000 contracts per day during 2008. We believe that the increases in volume were due primarily to changes in global supply and demand resulting in increased volatility as well as increased use of commodities as an asset class. Energy Products Energy products primarily consist of crude oil, natural gas, power and other energy-related exchange-traded contracts and over-the-counter contracts cleared through CME ClearPort. Average daily volume for energy contracts cleared through CME ClearPort increased by 16% to an average of 0.5 million per day in 2009 when compared with 2008, including the period prior to our merger. We believe the increase was due to market participants seeking to mitigate counterparty risk on their over-the-counter exposures through central counter party clearing. Metal Products Metal products generally include gold, silver and other precious and base metals. We believe metal products volume decreased by 4% to an average of 0.2 million contracts per day in 2009 when compared with 2008, including the period prior to our merger, due largely to lower volatility and decreased demand for metal products as a result of the credit crisis. 68 Average Rate per Contract CBOT total volume and fees have been included beginning July 13, 2007. NYMEX total volume and fees have been included beginning August 23, 2008. All amounts in the following table exclude TRAKRS, Swapstream, HuRLO contracts, credit default swaps and auction-traded products. Year-over-Year Change 2009 2008 2007 2009-2008 2008-2007 Total Volume (in millions) 2,584.9 2,978.5 2,249.6 (13 )% 33 % Clearing and Transaction Fees (in millions) $ 2,161.7 $ 2,114.7 $ 1,426.2 2 48 Average Rate per Contract 0.836 0.710 0.634 18 12 The average rate per contract increased in 2009 when compared with 2008 due to the addition of NYMEX products and CME ClearPort services to our existing product line, which had an average rate per contract of $1.512 and $2.051, respectively, in 2009. Additionally, the average rate per contract increased due to a lower portion of interest rate products as a percentage of total volume compared with equity products, which have a higher rate per contract. As a percentage of volume, equity products trading volume increased by 2% in 2009, while interest rate products volume decreased by 4% when compared with 2008. During 2008, the addition of NYMEX products and ClearPort services to our existing product lines was the primary contributor to an increase in the overall rate per contract when compared with 2007 as NYMEX products and CME ClearPort average rate per contract was $1.466 and $2.062 for the period August 23 through December 31, 2008. The increase in average rate per contract when compared with 2007 was also attributable to a lower portion of CME interest rate products as a percentage of total volume compared with CME equity products, which have a higher rate per contract. As a percentage of total volume, CME equity products trading volume increased by 9% in 2008, while CME interest rate products trading volume decreased by 10% when compared with 2007. In addition, the overall increase in the average rate per contract was partially attributable to the full year impact in 2008 of the average rate per contract for CBOT products. The average rate per contract for CBOT products in 2008 was $0.712. The increase in average rate per contract during 2008 was partially offset by a decrease in the average rate per contract for the E-mini S&P futures and options because incremental volume exceeded the CME Globex fee cap. Volume/Rate Analysis Average rate per contract is impacted by our rate structure, which includes volume-based incentives; product mix; trading venue, and the percentage of trading volume executed by customers who are members compared with non-member customers. Due to the relationship between average rate per contract and volume, the change in revenues attributable to changes in each is only an approximation. Using the total volume and average rate per contract data provided in the table above, we estimate that clearing and transaction fees revenue increased by $376.1 million due to the rise in average rate per contract and decreased by $329.1 million due to the decline in total volume, resulting in a net increase in revenues in 2009 of $47.0 million when compared with 2008. In 2008, we estimate that clearing and transaction fees revenue increased by $517.5 million due to an increase in total volume and increased by $171.0 million due to the increase in average rate per contract, resulting in a total increase in revenues of $688.5 million when compared with 2007. Concentration of Revenue We bill a substantial portion of our clearing and transaction fees to our clearing firms. The majority of clearing and transaction fees received from clearing firms represent charges for trades executed and cleared on behalf of their customers. As of December 31, 2009, we had approximately 140 clearing firms. One firm represented 11% and one firm represented 10% of our clearing and transaction fees revenue in 2009. One firm represented 12% and one firm represented 10% of our clearing and transaction fee revenue in 2008. In 2007, one firm represented 69 approximately 11% of clearing and transaction fees revenue. Should a clearing firm withdraw, we believe that the customer portion of the firm’s trading activity would likely transfer to another clearing firm of the exchange. Therefore, we do not believe we are exposed to significant risk from the loss of revenue received from a particular clearing firm. Quotation Data Fees. The increase in revenues in the periods presented were attributable to the following: Year-over-Year Change (dollars in millions except monthly fee per device) 2009 2008 2007 2009-2008 2008-2007 Average estimated monthly basic device screen count 414,000 349,000 219,000 65,000 130,000 Basic device monthly fee per device $ 55 $ 55 $ 50 $ — $ 5 Estimated increase in revenues Due to an increase in screen counts $ 43.4 $ 81.0 Due to an increase in monthly fee per device — 17.7 Data feed surcharges 4.0 12.3 Vendor licensing fees 5.0 4.9 Vendor audit assessments (2.8 ) 4.4 CME, CBOT and NYMEX services 49.6 120.3 CMA services 4.4 10.3 Incremental revenues of $59.2 million and $36.0 million generated from the NYMEX services in 2009 and 2008, which are included in the table above, contributed to the increase in overall revenues. In 2009, incremental revenues from NYMEX were partially offset by a decrease in CME and CBOT revenues when compared with 2008. Average basic device screen counts for existing CME and CBOT customers declined in 2009 due largely to cost-cutting initiatives at customer firms. The decrease in vendor audit assessments in 2009 was due to a $4.4 million assessment recognized in 2008 as a result of an audit of customer-reported device counts. This represented revenue that would have otherwise been recognized in prior periods. Revenues from CMA services include fees for data services provided to CMA customers subsequent to our acquisition of CMA in March 2008. Effective January 1, 2010, all users of our basic service will pay $61 per month for each device. The two largest resellers of our market data represented approximately 55%, 56% and 67% of our quotation data fees in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Despite this concentration, we consider exposure to significant risk of revenue loss to be minimal. In the event that one of these vendors no longer subscribes to our market data, we believe the majority of that vendor’s customers would likely subscribe to our market data through another reseller. Additionally, several of our largest institutional customers that utilize services from our two largest resellers report usage and remit payment of quotation data fees directly to us. Processing Services. The decrease in revenues over the periods presented was attributable to the termination of our prior service agreements with CBOT and NYMEX as a result of the mergers. In 2008 and 2007, we recognized revenue of $45.7 million and $56.4 million from our trade matching agreement with NYMEX, which was terminated on August 22, 2008. Our clearing agreement with CBOT, which was terminated on July 12, 2007, generated revenues of $48.2 million in 2007. In addition, the operations of FXMS terminated in the fourth quarter of 2008. As a result, we recognized incremental revenues of $6.4 million, when compared with 2007, primarily related to fees paid by FXMS for clearing and trade matching services which would have otherwise been recognized through January 2012. Access and Communication Fees. The increase in revenues from 2007 to 2008 was attributable to the telecommunication services provided to CBOT customers subsequent to our merger with CBOT Holdings in July 2007. The ongoing upgrade of customer bandwidth connections and expansion of our co-location program 70 contributed to growth in revenues from 2007 through 2009. The increase in 2009 when compared with 2008 was partially offset by a decrease in trading floor-related fees resulting from the consolidation of our Chicago trading floors in mid-2008. Other Revenues. Annual increases (decreases) in other revenues consisted primarily of the following: Year-over-Year Change (in millions) 2008-2007 2009-2008 NYMEX rental income and other building-related revenues $ 8.9 $ 4.4 Interest Earnings Facility programs 0.7 3.4 CBOT rental income and other building-related revenues (1.1 ) 16.1 FXMS (1.9 ) 1.1 From 2007 to 2009, the IEF programs generated additional revenues due to an increase in the average funds invested by our clearing firm members in these programs. In addition, revenues generated from CBOT’s building operations declined in 2009 as a result of a tenant termination fee recognized in the fourth quarter of 2008. Due to the termination of FXMS’s operations in the fourth quarter of 2008, we recognized additional revenues for fees paid by FXMS for billing and regulatory services. This contributed to lower revenues in 2009 and higher revenues in 2008. Operating Expenses Year-over-YearChange (in millions) 2009 2008 2007 2009-2008 2008-2007 Compensation and benefits $ 351.0 $ 317.6 $ 263.3 11 % 21 % Communications 47.0 52.3 43.5 (10 ) 20 Technology support services 46.2 59.6 50.5 (23 ) 18 Professional fees and outside services 85.1 71.9 53.1 18 35 Amortization of purchased intangibles 125.1 98.7 33.9 27 n.m. Depreciation and amortization 126.3 137.3 105.7 (8 ) 30 Occupancy and building operations 76.3 71.4 48.2 7 48 Licensing and other fee agreements 89.2 70.3 35.6 27 97 Restructuring 5.3 4.8 8.9 11 (46 ) Other 72.2 94.9 61.5 (24 ) 54 Total Expenses $ 1,023.7 $ 978.8 $ 704.2 5 39 n.m. not meaningful Compensation and Benefits. Annual increases (decreases) in expenses consisted primarily of the following: Year-over-Year Change (in millions) 2009-2008 2008-2007 Average headcount $ 24.4 $ 45.5 Non-qualified deferred compensation plan 12.7 (10.4 ) Average salaries, benefits and employer taxes 4.0 7.3 Bonus 0.3 (6.9 ) Stock-based compensation (4.1 ) 14.7 • Average headcount increased by 10% or about 200 employees in 2009 and 22% or about 380 employees in 2008. The increases resulted from the addition of approximately 400 employees in our merger with NYMEX Holdings and approximately 690 employees in our merger with CBOT Holdings, 71 the impacts of which were partially offset by our restructuring plans. Additionally, headcount increased by 50 employees as a result of the CMA acquisition in March 2008. As of December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, we had approximately 2,260, 2,300 and 1,970 employees, respectively. • The increase in our non-qualified deferred compensation plan liability in 2009 also contributed to an increase in expenses when compared with 2008. In 2008 when compared with 2007, the decrease in our liability contributed to a decrease in expenses. These impacts do not affect net income because of an equal and offsetting change in investment income. • Salary increases and rising pension and healthcare costs contributed to increases in average salaries, benefits and employer taxes from 2007 to 2009. Salary increases in 2009 were largely due to staff promotions. • Bonus expense increased in 2009 due primarily to an increase in headcount during the year largely offset by a decline in performance relative to our 2009 cash earnings target compared with 2008 relative to our 2008 cash earnings target. The increases in expenses in 2008 were partially offset by a decrease in bonus expense due primarily to a decline in performance relative to our 2008 cash earnings target compared with 2007 relative to our 2007 cash earnings target. • Increases in total expense in 2009 were partially offset by a decrease in stock-based compensation due to our decision to delay annual stock grants for 2009 until the third quarter. The additional expense related to the June 2008 grant and the conversion of stock options previously granted to NYMEX Holdings’ employees partially offset the impact of this delay. Stock-based compensation increased in 2008 due primarily to the accelerated vesting of stock options previously granted to NYMEX Holdings’ employees and the full impact of the expense related to the June 2007 grant.

The elimination of costs incurred to support our CBOT metal products on e-CBOT, CBOT’s legacy electronic trading platform that was terminated as of July 2008, as well as improved network efficiencies as a result of the consolidation of trading systems and floor operations in Chicago contributed to a decline in expenses in 2009 when compared with 2008. The decrease was partially offset by incremental expenses of $3.0 million generated by NYMEX operations in 2009 when compared with 2008. The increase in expenses in 2008 when compared with 2007 was primarily due to the costs incurred to upgrade bandwidth for customers and consolidate our trading floor operations. In addition, we incurred a full year of NYMEX communications expense during 2009. Technology Support Services. The decreases in expenses in 2009 when compared with 2008 were largely due to the termination of maintenance and service agreements for e-CBOT in July 2008. The declines in expenses were partially offset by incremental expenses generated by NYMEX operations. The increase in expenses in 2008 when compared with 2007 was due to increases in software and hardware maintenance contracts, including the maintenance and support of the e-CBOT electronic trading platform, and increases in software. Professional Fees and Outside Services. Costs incurred to support various strategic initiatives, including our efforts to provide clearing services for credit default swaps and other over-the-counter products, led to growth in expenses in 2009 when compared with 2008. In addition, the increase in expenses was attributable to consulting services and other outside services associated with ongoing NYMEX operations. The increase in 2009 was partially offset by a decrease in expenses as the result of additional temporary staffing and consulting services in 2008 due to infrastructure development, product support and various strategic initiatives. In 2008, when compared with 2007, the increases in technology-related and other professional fees, net of amounts capitalized for internally developed software, were due primarily to consulting services used to supplement our merger integration efforts as well as non-capitalizable software development costs and expenses incurred to support our strategic initiatives. 72 Legal fees increased in 2008 when compared with 2007 due to class action lawsuits filed in connection with the NYMEX Holdings merger. The increase in expenses was partially offset by higher legal fees in 2007 due to litigation costs related to Louisiana Municipal Police Employee’s Retirement System (LAMPERS) and CBOE proceedings resulting from our merger with CBOT Holdings, as well as the ongoing antitrust suit filed by Eurex U.S. Amortization of Purchased Intangibles. Amortization increased from 2007 to 2009 due primarily to the amortization of intangible assets acquired in our mergers with CBOT Holdings and NYMEX Holdings, completed in July 2007 and August 2008, respectively. Depreciation and Amortization. Declines in expenses in 2009, when compared with 2008, were attributable primarily to trading floor consolidation and systems integration in 2008 as well as capital expenditure reductions in 2009. The decreases were partially offset by incremental depreciation expense related to assets acquired in our merger with NYMEX Holdings in August 2008 and incremental depreciation expense on our new data center building that we have been depreciating since August 2009. Expenses increased in 2008 compared with 2007 due to assets acquired in our mergers with NYMEX Holdings and CBOT Holdings. In addition, we accelerated depreciation in 2008 on various CBOT technology-related and trading floor assets as well as certain NYMEX technology-related assets. Property additions are summarized below. Technology-related assets include purchases of computers and related equipment, software, the cost of developing internal use software and the build-out of our data centers. The decrease in total property additions and technology-related assets as a percentage of total additions during 2009, when compared with 2008, was due to our efforts to reduce equipment and software purchases in 2009. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in purchases of assets associated with our new data center, which we began capitalizing in early 2008. Total additions related to our new data center for 2008 and 2009 totaled $83.6 million, including $50.2 million in 2009. The useful lives associated with the new data center range from 10 to 39 years. Increases in property additions in 2008, when compared with 2007, were due primarily to spending for the development of our new data center and the development of our Chicago office space. Year-over-Year Change (dollars in millions) 2009 2008 2007 2009-2008 2008-2007 Total property additions, including landlord-funded leasehold improvements $ 157.9 $ 200.1 $ 163.7 (21 )% 22 % Technology-related assets as a percentage of total property additions 65 % 72 % 77 % Occupancy and Building Operations. Increases in expenses from 2007 to 2009 were attributable primarily to commercial real estate acquired in our merger with NYMEX Holdings. Expenses associated with the acquired property include utilities, maintenance, property taxes and insurance expenses. These increases in 2009 were partially offset by a decrease resulting from a reduction in temporary space in our Chicago headquarters. In addition, rent expense increases in 2008, when compared with 2007, were due to additional office space in London, Hong Kong, Japan and Singapore as well as property acquired through the merger with CBOT Holdings. Additionally, the property for our new data center was purchased in 2008, resulting in increased occupancy expense. Licensing and Other Fee Agreements. The incremental expense generated from broker rebates, royalty fees and other licensing fees on NYMEX products contributed to the increases when compared with 2008. Total broker rebates were $39.3 million and $13.6 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. Increases in 2009 were partially offset by decreases in licensing fees for E-mini and standard equity products of $8.4 million due to declines in trading volume. Fee sharing expenses also decreased $1.2 million in 2009 when compared with 2008 due primarily to the sale of CBOT metals products in September 2008. 73 In 2008, higher average daily trading volume for certain licensed products and additional royalty fees and broker rebates on NYMEX products contributed to additional expenses when compared with 2007. In addition, licensing fees on E-mini S&P and on E-mini NASDAQ-100 products contributed to the increase in 2008. Restructuring. This expense consisted primarily of severance to transitional CBOT and NYMEX employees, severance to CME employees, retention bonuses and associated payroll taxes as well as outplacement costs and post-employment healthcare subsidies. The restructuring program related to the CBOT Holdings merger was substantially complete by July 2008. The restructuring program related to the NYMEX Holdings merger was substantially complete by August 2009. Other Expenses. Annual increases (decreases) in other expenses consisted primarily of the following: Year-over-Year Change (in millions) 2009-2008 2008-2007 Goodwill impairment on Swapstream operations $ (11.9 ) $ 11.9 Marketing, advertising and other costs due to the mergers and other strategic initiatives (9.0 ) 6.3 Foreign currency transaction (gains) losses primarily related to the Brazilian real and British pound (4.9 ) 3.8 CMA in-process research and development costs recorded in 2008 (3.7 ) 3.7 Loss on sale of CBOT metals trading products recorded in 2008 (2.8 ) 2.8 In addition, the company’s expense reduction efforts contributed to the decreases in expenses in 2009 when compared with 2008. The decreases in expenses in 2009 were partially offset by incremental expenses incurred as part of the NYMEX Holdings merger, increases in other state and local taxes, bank fees and litigation settlements, including the CBOE ERP settlement. In 2008, a higher level of general and administrative expenses resulting from our mergers also contributed to an increase in expenses when compared with 2007. Non-Operating Income (Expense) Year-over-Year Change (dollars in millions) 2009 2008 2007 2009-2008 2008-2007 Investment income $ 28.5 $ 45.5 $ 73.2 (37 )% (38 )% Impairment of long-term investments (46.0 ) (274.5 ) — (83 ) n.m.

Total Non-Operating $ (151.6 ) $ (334.2 ) $ 43.9 (55 ) n.m. n.m. not meaningful Investment Income. From 2007 to 2009, investment income declined due primarily to decreases in market interest rates throughout 2008 resulting from rate reductions by the Federal Open Market Committee. The decline due to interest rates was partially offset by an increase in the invested portion of clearing firms’ cash from performance bonds and security deposits. Annualized average rates of return and average investment balances indicated in the table below include the portion of clearing firms’ cash performance bonds and security deposits we chose to invest and other short-term 74 investments classified as either cash and cash equivalents or marketable securities in our consolidated balance sheets. The increase in average investment balance for clearing firms’ cash during 2009, when compared with prior years, was a result of firms choosing to meet a greater proportion of their performance bond requirements with cash instead of securities. The average balance of other short-term investments is a function of anticipated or possible short-term cash needs, prevailing interest rates, our investment policy and alternative investment choices. Year-over-Year Change (dollars in millions) 2009 2008 2007 2009-2008 2008-2007 Invested portion of clearing firms’ cash: Annual average rate of return 0.11 % 2.03 % 4.42 % (1.92 )% (2.39 )% Average investment balance $ 4,434.4 $ 416.3 $ 273.1 $ 4,018.1 $ 143.2 Change in income due to rate (85.2 ) (9.9 ) Change in income due to balance 81.7 6.3 Other short-term investments: Annual average rate of return 0.59 % 2.87 % 4.47 % (2.28 )% (1.60 )% Average investment balance $ 479.9 $ 1,082.2 $ 1,290.7 $ (602.3 ) $ (208.5 ) Change in income due to rate (10.9 ) (19.3 ) Change in income due to balance (17.3 ) (9.4 ) The analysis presented in the table above does not include income (loss) on insurance contracts or gains (losses) on marketable securities related to our non-qualified deferred compensation plans. We recognized $4.5 million, $(8.2) million and $(2.2) million in gains (losses) on marketable securities associated with our deferred compensation plans in 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. We exclude the impact of the marketable securities related to our non-qualified deferred compensation plan from this analysis because gains and losses from these securities are offset by an equal amount of compensation and benefits expense. Dividend income from our investments in BM&FBOVESPA and TMX Group Inc. stock is also excluded from the table above. Dividend income was $15.8 million and $13.3 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. We did not earn dividend income in 2007. Impairment of Long-Term Investments. We assess our equity investments for other-than-temporary impairment on a quarterly basis. At December 31, 2009 we determined our investment in DME was impaired due to the excess of our carrying value over the estimated fair value. As a result we recognized an impairment charge of $23.6 million. At September 30, 2009, we determined that our investment in IMAREX was impaired due to an extended and significant decline in the market price of its stock. As a result we recognized an impairment charge of $22.4 million. During 2008 we determined that our investment in BM&FBOVESPA was impaired due to an extended decline in the market price of BM&F stock. As a result we recognized an impairment loss of $274.5 million. Gains (Losses) on Derivative Investments. The net gain (loss) on derivative investments recognized in 2008 was primarily due to the loss on a put option contract purchased to hedge our risk of changes in the fair value of BM&FBOVESPA stock resulting from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and the Brazilian real. We entered into the put option with Lehman Brothers Special Financing Inc. in February 2008 and we terminated the contract in September 2008 when Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. filed for bankruptcy. Securities Lending Income and Expense. During 2009, CME’s securities lending program remained suspended as the high volatility in the credit markets and extreme demand for U.S. Treasury securities continued. Expenses decreased in 2008, when compared with 2007, due primarily to the curtailment, and at times suspension, of our securities lending program due to increasing volatility in the credit markets and demand for U.S. Treasury securities. This resulted in a decline in the average daily balance of funds invested in 2008 when compared with 2007. The increase in spread between the average rate earned and the average rate paid during 2008 was due to 75 the combination of an increase in demand for U.S. Treasury securities, which affects the rate paid, and a lag effect from changing interest rates in the reinvested cash in money market funds, which affects the rate earned. The decrease in 2008 overall revenue and expense was attributable to the decline in average funds invested as well as the Federal Open Market Committee’s interest rate reductions. Year-over-Year Change (dollars in billions) 2009 2008 2007 2009-2008 2008-2007 Average daily balance of funds invested $ — $ 0.9 $ 2.3 $ (0.9 ) $ (1.4 ) Annual average rate earned — % 3.40 % 5.27 % (3.40 )% (1.87 )% Annual average rate paid — 2.77 5.03 (2.77 ) (2.26 ) Net earned from securities lending — % 0.63 % 0.24 % (0.63 )% 0.39 % The table above does not include activity from the NYMEX securities lending program, which closed in June 2009. Under the program, securities lending interest income and expense totaled $2.8 million and $0.4 million, respectively, for 2009. For 2008, securities lending interest income and expense totaled $6.9 million and $1.7 million, respectively. In 2008, we also recognized an impairment loss of $18.3 million on a corporate debt security held in the NYMEX securities lending portfolio. In addition, securities lending interest expense for 2009 included a $0.3 million recovery of a $6.0 million impairment charge related to the CME securities lending program that was previously recognized in the third quarter of 2008. The table above does not include this recovery or the initial charge. Interest and Other Borrowing Costs. The increases in interest and other borrowing costs in 2009 and 2008 were due to higher average debt levels outstanding, which were the result of debt issued in August 2008 in conjunction with the NYMEX Holdings merger. These borrowings consisted of commercial paper and short- and long-term notes. Prior to August 2008, borrowings consisted only of commercial paper. Year-over-Year Change 2009 2008 2007 2009-2008 2008-2007 Weighted average borrowings outstanding (in millions) $ 2,841.8 $ 1,296.1 $ 64.2 $ 1,545.7 $ 1,231.9 Weighted average effective yield 4.23 % 3.58 % 4.95 % 0.65 % (1.37 )% Total cost of borrowing 4.76 4.30 4.98 0.46 (0.68 ) Total cost of borrowing includes interest, commitment fees, discount accretion and debt issuance costs. In February 2009, we terminated our revolving bridge facility. Total debt issuance costs recognized for the bridge facility during the first quarter of 2009 were $7.6 million, including $4.6 million of accelerated costs resulting from the facility’s termination. Guarantee of Exercise Right Privileges. Under the terms of our merger with CBOT Holdings, holders that did not elect to sell their ERPs to us were entitled to a minimum guaranteed payment of up to $250,000 upon resolution of the lawsuit between CBOT and CBOE. Our liability under the guarantee, which was recorded at fair value in other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets, was estimated at $1.2 million and $14.0 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. In December 2009, final approval of the settlement occurred and we reduced our liability to zero. Following the resolution of the lawsuit, we also adjusted the value of the 159 ERPs that we hold to the expected settlement value. The liability decreased during 2008 due to a reassessment of possible outcomes of the litigation which resulted in a gain for 2008. The expense in 2007 was due to the establishment of the liability. Equity in Losses of Unconsolidated Subsidiaries. The termination of our investment in FXMS, our joint venture with Reuters, in the fourth quarter of 2008 contributed to the decrease in losses in 2009 when compared with 2008. In 2008, we recognized losses from our investment in FXMS of $26.5 million including a $15.9 76 million write off of our recorded investment in FXMS and our portion of the remaining capital needed to wind down operations. Losses in 2009 included our share of losses from our investments in DME, Green Exchange Holdings LLC and OneChicago. The decision to terminate our investment in FXMS resulted in an increase in losses in 2008 when compared with 2007. Other Non-Operating Expense. The reduction in expenses was attributable to additional expenses in 2008 due to transfer and other transaction fees related to our investment in BM&FBOVESPA in the first quarter of 2008. Income Tax Provision The effective tax rate was 42.6% in 2009 compared with 42.7% in 2008 and 39.9% in 2007. In 2009, the rate increased as a result of an additional valuation allowance of $64.4 million related to unrealized capital losses partially offset by a $38.9 million reduction in net deferred tax liabilities related to a New York City tax law change enacted in 2009. In 2008, the rate reflected a $48.3 million charge to record the impact of our new combined state and local tax rate on our existing net deferred tax liabilities, partially offset by a first quarter 2008 Illinois tax law change that resulted in a $38.6 million reduction in net deferred tax liabilities. The increase in rates during 2009 and 2008, when compared with 2007, was due primarily to the state and local tax impact of our merger with NYMEX Holdings in August 2008. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash Requirements. Until we began our commercial paper program in mid-2007, we historically met our funding requirements with cash generated by our ongoing operations. While our cost structure is primarily fixed in the short term, our sources of operating cash are largely dependent on trading volume levels. We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to cover our working capital needs, capital expenditures, and other commitments. However, it is possible that we may need to raise additional funds to finance our activities through future public debt offerings or by borrowing money from financial institutions. Cash will also be required for operating leases and non-cancelable contractual obligations as well as commitments reflected as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2009. These commitments are as follows: (in millions) OperatingLeases ContractualObligations OtherLiabilities Total(a) Year 2010 $ 20.0 $ 19.9 $ 39.0 $ 78.9 2011-2012 42.3 20.8 — 63.1 2013-2014 39.0 8.0 — 47.0 Thereafter 133.7 — — 133.7 Total $ 235.0 $ 48.7 $ 39.0 $ 322.7 (a) Gross unrecognized tax liabilities, including interest and penalties, of $51.3 million determined under accounting guidance for uncertain tax positions are not included in the commitment table due to uncertainty about the date of their settlement. Future capital expenditures for technology are anticipated as we continue to support our growth through investment in increased system capacity and performance and through technological initiatives on our electronic trading platforms. Each year capital expenditures are incurred for improvements to and expansion of our offices, remote data centers, telecommunications capabilities and other operating equipment. In 2010, we expect capital expenditures to total between $180 million and $200 million. We continue to monitor our capital needs and may revise our forecasted expenditures as necessary in the future. 77 We intend to continue to pay a regular quarterly dividend to our shareholders. The decision to pay a dividend, however, remains within the discretion of our board of directors and may be affected by various factors, including our earnings, financial condition, capital requirements, levels of indebtedness and other considerations our board of directors deems relevant as well as our debt instruments as discussed below. CME Group and its subsidiaries are also required to comply with restrictions contained in the General Corporation Laws of its state of incorporation which could also limit its (or their) ability to declare and pay dividends. In 2009, our quarterly dividend remained at $1.15 per share. For 2010, our quarterly dividend target is expected to remain at this level. On February 2, 2010, the board of directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of $1.15 per share payable on March 25, 2010, to shareholders of record on March 10, 2010. Assuming no changes in the number of shares outstanding, the 2010 dividend payment will total approximately $76.6 million. Sources and Uses of Cash. Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.1 billion in 2009 compared with $1.2 billion in 2008. Net cash provided by operating activities decreased due primarily to decreased profitability excluding impairment charges. In 2009, net cash provided by operating activities was $257.3 million higher than net income. This increase was due primarily to $126.3 million of depreciation and amortization and $125.1 million of amortization of purchased intangibles. Net cash provided by investing activities was $544.8 million in 2009 compared with net cash used in investing activities of $3.7 billion in 2008. The increase in cash was due primarily to cash paid to shareholders in our merger with NYMEX Holdings in 2008 of $2.8 billion, net of cash received, and a payment of $612.0 million for the termination of certain NYMEX membership rights in conjunction with the merger. The increase in cash was also due to a $315.8 million net decrease in NYMEX securities lending program investments and a $382.4 million increase in proceeds from maturities of marketable securities, net of purchases in 2009. Net cash used in financing activities was $1.7 billion in 2009 compared with cash provided by financing activities of $2.0 billion in 2008. The increase in cash used relative to the prior period was due primarily to new issuances of debt of $2.9 billion in 2008 in conjunction with our merger with NYMEX Holdings compared with net debt reductions of $900.1 million in 2009. Debt Instruments. We maintain public debt of $1.8 billion, consisting of $300.0 million of floating rate notes due in 2010, $750.0 million of 5.40% fixed rate notes due in 2013 and $750.0 million of 5.75% fixed rate notes due in 2014. The floating rate notes due in 2010 accrue interest at the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus 0.65%. We entered into an interest-rate swap agreement that effectively fixed the rate at 3.92% for the floating rate notes due in 2010. The proceeds from the debt issuances were used to finance our merger with NYMEX Holdings and to repay any outstanding commercial paper borrowings that were backstopped by our 364-day revolving bridge facility as well as for general corporate purposes. We terminated the bridge facility on February 10, 2009. In August 2009, we repaid $250.0 million of floating rate notes upon their maturity. We also maintain a $1.4 billion senior credit facility with various financial institutions, which includes a term loan of $420.5 million and a revolving credit facility of $945.5 million. On September 30, 2009, we amended this agreement to reduce the aggregate amount of revolving credit facility commitments to $945.5 million from $995.5 million and to reduce the minimum required amount of each request for an increase in revolving commitments from $25.0 million to $10.0 million. As long as we are not in default under the senior credit facility, we have the option to increase the facility from time to time by an aggregate amount of up to $1.1 billion, to a total of $2.5 billion of revolving loans, with only the consent of the agent and the lenders providing the additional funds. Proceeds from the senior credit facility were used to pay fees and expenses and finance our merger with NYMEX Holdings; to pay fees and expenses in connection with the refinancing of existing debt of NYMEX Holdings; to finance dividends and stock repurchases, and to support issuances of commercial paper. The revolving credit facility expires on August 21, 2011. At December 31, 2009, we have excess borrowing capacity for general corporate purposes of approximately $845.5 million. 78 We maintain a 364-day revolving line of credit with a consortium of banks to be used in certain situations by our clearing house. The line of credit, which was renewed in December 2009, provides for borrowings of up to $1.0 billion. This line of credit is collateralized by clearing firm security deposits held by us in the form of U.S. Treasury or agency securities, as well as security deposit funds in the IEF and any performance bond deposits of a clearing firm that may default on its obligation. The line of credit can only be drawn on to the extent it is collateralized. At December 31, 2009, security deposit collateral available was $2.4 billion. We have the option to request an increase in the line from $1.0 billion to $1.5 billion with the participating banks’ approval. As of December 31, 2009, we maintained an AA long-term credit rating and an A1+ short-term credit rating with Standard & Poor’s (S&P). We maintained an Aa3 long-term credit rating and a P1 short-term credit rating with Moody’s Investor Service. The outlook for our ratings is considered stable by S&P and Moody’s. Given our ability to pay down debt levels and refinance existing debt facilities if necessary, we expect to maintain an investment grade rating. If our ratings are downgraded due to a change in control which results in a downgrade below investment grade, we are required to make an offer to repurchase our fixed and floating rate notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest. The indentures governing our floating and fixed rate notes, our 364-day revolving line of credit for $1.0 billion and our senior credit facility for $1.4 billion due 2011 do not contain specific covenants that restrict the ability to pay dividends. These documents, however, do contain other customary financial and operating covenants that place restrictions on the operations of the company, which could indirectly affect the ability to pay dividends. For example, under our senior credit facility, we are required to remain in compliance with a consolidated net worth test, defined as our consolidated shareholders’ equity as of June 30, 2008 on a pro forma basis to give effect to the NYMEX Holdings merger and to give effect to the share repurchases made and special dividends paid, but only up to the amount of such repurchases and dividends publicly announced and made or paid within 18 months after August 22, 2008 (and in no event greater than $1.5 billion in the aggregate for such repurchases and dividends), multiplied by 0.65. In addition, our 364-day revolving line of credit contains a requirement that CME remain in compliance with a consolidated tangible net worth test, defined as consolidated shareholder’s equity less intangible assets (as defined in the agreement), of not less than $125.0 million. In the event that CME elects to increase the facility, the minimum consolidated tangible net worth test will increase ratably up to $187.5 million. CME Group, as a holding company, has no operations of its own. Instead, it relies on dividends declared and paid to it by its subsidiaries, including CME, in order to provide a portion of the funds which it uses to pay dividends to its shareholders. As of December 31, 2009, we are in compliance with the various covenant requirements of all our debt facilities. To satisfy our performance bond obligation with Singapore Exchange Limited, we may pledge CME-owned U.S. Treasury securities in lieu of, or in combination with, irrevocable letters of credit. At December 31, 2009, the letters of credit totaled $83.0 million. CME also guarantees a $5.0 million standby letter of credit for GFX. The beneficiary of this letter of credit is the clearing firm that is used by GFX to execute and maintain its futures position. The letter of credit would be utilized in the event that GFX defaults in meeting performance bond requirements to its clearing firm. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements. As of December 31, 2009, we did not have any significant off-balance sheet arrangements as defined by the regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Liquidity and Cash Management. Cash and cash equivalents totaled $260.6 million at December 31, 2009 and $297.9 million at December 31, 2008. The balance retained in cash and cash equivalents is a function of 79 anticipated or possible short-term cash needs, prevailing interest rates, our investment policy and alternative investment choices. In June 2008, we approved a repurchase of up to $1.1 billion of CME Group Class A common stock over a period of 18 months, which expired in December 2009. In January 2009, we suspended this program as we devoted our excess cash flows to debt reduction. Our practice is to have our pension plan 100% funded at each year end on a projected benefit obligation basis, while also satisfying any minimum required contribution and obtaining the maximum tax deduction. Based on our actuarial projections, we estimate that a $14.3 million contribution in 2010 will allow us to meet our funding goal. However, the amount of the actual contribution is contingent on the actual rate of return on our plan assets during 2010 and the December 31, 2010 discount rate. Net current deferred tax assets of $23.8 million and $95.5 million are included in other current assets at December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008, respectively. Total net current deferred tax assets include primarily unrealized losses and accrued expenses. Net long-term deferred tax liabilities were $7.6 billion and $7.7 billion at December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008, respectively. Net deferred tax liabilities are primarily the result of purchase accounting for intangible assets in our mergers with CBOT Holdings and NYMEX Holdings. We have a long-term deferred tax asset of $145.9 million included within our domestic long-term deferred tax liability. This deferred tax asset is for an unrealized capital loss incurred in Brazil related to our investment in BM&FBOVESPA. As of December 31, 2009, we do not believe that we currently meet the more-likely-than-not threshold that would allow us to fully realize the value of the unrealized capital loss. As a result, a partial valuation allowance of $64.5 million has been provided for the amount of the unrealized capital loss that exceeds potential capital gains that could be used to offset the capital loss in future periods. We also have a long-term deferred tax asset related to Brazilian taxes of $127.1 million for an unrealized capital loss incurred in Brazil related to our investment in BM&FBOVESPA. A full valuation allowance of $127.1 million has been provided because we do not believe that we currently meet the more-likely-than-not threshold that would allow us to realize the value of the unrealized capital loss in Brazil in the future. Valuation allowances of $51.6 million have also been provided for additional unrealized capital losses on various other investments. Net long-term deferred tax assets also include a $21.2 million deferred tax asset for foreign net operating losses related to Swapstream. Our assessment at December 31, 2009 was that we did not currently meet the more-likely-than-not threshold that would allow us to realize the value of acquired and accumulated foreign net operating losses in the future. As a result, the $21.2 million deferred tax assets arising from these net operating losses has been fully reserved. Each clearing firm is required to deposit and maintain a specified performance bond balance, which is determined by parameters established by the risk management department of the clearing house and may fluctuate over time. Performance bond requirements can be satisfied with a variety of approved investments and cash. Cash performance bonds and security deposits are included in our consolidated balance sheets. With the exception of the portion of securities deposited that are utilized in our securities lending program, clearing firm deposits, other than those retained in the form of cash, are not included in our consolidated balance sheets. Securities lending transactions utilize a portion of the securities that clearing firms have deposited to satisfy their proprietary performance bond requirements. Securities lending activity fluctuates based on the amount of securities that clearing firms have deposited and the demand for securities lending activity in the particular securities available to us. As a result of these factors, the balances in cash performance bonds and security deposits, as well as the balances in our securities lending program, may fluctuate significantly over time. The performance bonds and security deposits for NYMEX clearing firms have been included in total performance bonds and security deposits subsequent to the merger with NYMEX Holdings in August 2008. 80 Cash performance bonds and security deposits and collateral from securities lending consisted of the following at December 31: (in millions) 2009 2008 Cash performance bonds $ 5,834.6 $ 17,296.1 Cash security deposits 102.6 152.3 Cross-margin arrangements 10.6 204.4 Performance collateral for delivery 34.1 0.7 Total Cash Performance Bonds and Security Deposits 5,981.9 17,653.5 Collateral from securities lending activity — 426.9 Total $ 5,981.9 $ 18,080.4 We are required under the Commodity Exchange Act to segregate cash and securities deposited by clearing firms on behalf of customers. In addition, our exchange rules require a segregation of all funds and securities deposited by clearing firms from exchange operating funds and marketable securities. As with cash performance bonds and security deposits, these balances will fluctuate due to the investment choices available to clearing firms and the change in total deposits required. Securities, at fair value, and IEF funds were deposited for the following purposes at December 31: (in millions) 2009 2008 Performance bonds $ 70,511.5 $ 96,220.5 Security deposits 2,652.2 1,997.9 Cross-margin arrangements 220.5 188.3 Performance collateral for delivery 2.6 3.6 Total $ 73,386.8 $ 98,410.3 Fair Value Measurements. We use a three-level framework in order to determine the fair value of financial assets and liabilities. In general, we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets to determine fair values of marketable securities, securities lending collateral and equity investments. Level 1 assets include U.S. Treasury securities, exchange-traded mutual funds, repurchase agreements and publicly-traded equity securities. If quoted prices are not available to determine fair value, we use other inputs that are observable either directly or indirectly. Assets included in level 2 consist primarily of U.S. Government agency securities, municipal bonds, asset-backed securities and certain corporate bonds. Level 3 assets include certain corporate bonds and asset-backed securities. These assets have been valued using valuation models with inputs that are both observable and unobservable. The unobservable inputs used in these models are significant to the fair value of the investments and require management’s judgment. We determine the fair value of our interest rate swap contracts, considered level 2 assets, using standard valuation models that are based on market-based observable inputs including forward and spot exchange rates and interest rate curves. The fair value of our liability for the guarantee of ERPs was derived using probability-weighted Black-Scholes option values for various scenarios. The liability is included in level 3 because management uses significant unobservable inputs including probability, expected return and volatility factors to determine its fair value. Financial assets and liabilities recorded in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2009 are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the asset or liability’s fair value measurement. 81 Financial Instruments Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis: (in millions) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Assets at Fair Value: Marketable securities $ 28.5 $ 14.1 $ — $ 42.6 Equity investments 66.2 — — 66.2 Total Assets at Fair Value $ 94.7 $ 14.1 $ — $ 108.8 Liabilities at Fair Value: Interest rate swap contracts $ — $ 26.3 $ — $ 26.3 Total Liabilities at Fair Value $ — $ 26.3 $ — $ 26.3 The following is a reconciliation of assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (level 3) during 2009.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are subject to various market risks, including those caused by changes in interest rates, credit, foreign currency exchange rates, and equity prices. Interest Rate Risk Debt outstanding at December 31, 2009 consisted of fixed rate borrowings of $1.6 billion and variable rate borrowings of $0.7 billion. Commercial paper is included in fixed rate borrowings; however, because maturities for commercial paper are generally less than 90 days, commercial paper is considered subject to interest rate fluctuations. Borrowings subject to variable interest rate fluctuations were as follows as of December 31, 2009: (dollars in millions) Balance StatedInterest Rate Commercial paper $ 100.0 0.24 % Floating rate notes due August 2010(1) 299.8 0.93 Term loan due August 2011(2) 420.5 1.29 Total debt subject to variable interest fluctuations $ 820.3 (1) The 2010 notes bear interest at a floating rate equal to three-month LIBOR plus 0.65% per year. In September 2008, we entered into an interest-rate swap agreement that modifies the variable interest obligation associated with these notes so that the interest payable on the notes effectively becomes fixed at a rate of 3.92% beginning with the interest accrued after November 6, 2008. (2) The term loan bears interest at a floating rate equal to three-month LIBOR plus 1.00% per year. In September 2008, we entered into an interest-rate swap agreement that modifies the variable interest obligation associated with this facility so that the interest payable effectively becomes fixed at a rate of 4.72% beginning with the interest accrued after October 22, 2008. Credit Risk Our clearing house acts as the counterparty to all trades consummated on or through our exchange as well as through third-party exchanges and over-the-counter markets for which we provide clearing services. As a result, we are exposed to significant credit risk of third parties, including our clearing firms. We are also exposed, indirectly, to the credit risk of customers of our clearing firms. These parties may default on their obligations due to bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, operational failure or other reasons. In order to ensure performance, we establish and monitor financial requirements for our clearing firms. We set minimum performance bond requirements for our traded products. We typically hold performance bond collateral to cover at least 95% of price changes for a given product within a given historical period. Our clearing house marks-to-market all open positions at least twice a day, and more often if market volatility warrants; providing both participants in a transaction with an accounting of their financial obligations under the contract. This allows our clearing house to identify quickly any clearing firms that may not be able to satisfy the financial obligations resulting from changes in the prices of their open contracts before those financial obligations become exceptionally large and jeopardize the ability of our clearing house to ensure performance of their open positions. This transparency makes it difficult for traders to hide losses or disguise unusual profits. In select circumstances where CME has introduced clearing services to newer markets, positions are marked-to-market daily, with the capability to mark-to-market more frequently as market conditions warrant. Although we have policies and procedures to help ensure that our clearing firms can satisfy their obligations, these policies and procedures may not succeed in detecting problems or preventing defaults. We also have in place various measures intended to enable us to cover any default and maintain liquidity. In the unlikely event of 83 a payment default by a clearing firm, we would first apply assets of that clearing firm to cover its payment obligation. These assets include security deposits, performance bonds and any other available assets, such as proceeds from the sale of Class A common stock and trading rights (at CME, CBOT, NYMEX and/or COMEX as applicable) owned by or assigned to the clearing firm. In addition, we would make a demand for payment pursuant to any applicable guarantee provided to the exchange by the parent of a clearing firm. Thereafter, if the payment default remains unsatisfied, we would use our surplus funds, security deposits of other clearing firms and funds collected through an assessment against all other solvent clearing firms to satisfy the deficit. We maintain a $1.0 billion 364-day revolving line of credit with a consortium of banks. We have the option to increase the facility from $1.0 billion to $1.5 billion, subject to approval by the participating banks. We are required to post additional collateral in connection with any such increase. This line of credit may also be utilized if there is a temporary disruption with the domestic payments system that would delay settlement payments between our clearing house and clearing firms. The credit agreement requires us to pledge clearing firm security deposits held by us in the form of U.S. Treasury or agency securities, as well as security deposit funds in our IEF program to the line of credit custodian prior to drawing on the line. Performance bond collateral of a defaulting clearing firm may also be used to secure a draw on the line. The following shows the available assets of our clearing house at December 31, 2009 in the event of a payment default by a clearing firm: (in millions) CME Clearing HouseAvailable Assets Aggregate Performance Bond Deposits by All Clearing Firms(1) $ 76,346.1 CME Surplus Funds(2) 354.6 Security Deposits of Clearing Firms(3) 2,375.8 Limited Assessment Powers(4) 6,533.4 Minimum Total Assets Available for Default(5) $ 9,263.8 (1) Aggregate performance bond deposits by all clearing firms includes cash performance bond deposits of $5.8 billion and the market value of the securities deposited to satisfy performance bond requirements. In the event of a default, we also have the ability to use the Class A shares and membership shares pledged by members. (2) CME surplus funds represent the amount of CME’s working capital reduced by an amount necessary to support CME’s short-term operations. Our target for surplus funds is $100.0 million with amounts in excess of this target generally paid as a dividend from CME to CME Group on a quarterly basis based on prior quarter-end balances. (3) Security deposits of clearing firms include security deposits required of clearing firms, but do not include any excess deposits held by our exchange at the direction of the clearing firms. (4) In the event of a clearing firm default, if a loss continues to exist after the utilization of the assets of the defaulted firm, our surplus funds and the security deposits of non-defaulting firms, we have the right to assess all non-defaulting clearing members up to 2.75 times their existing security deposit requirements. (5) Represents the aggregate minimum resources available to satisfy any obligations not met by a defaulting firm able to clear CME, CBOT, NYMEX and COMEX products subsequent to the liquidation of the defaulting firm’s performance bond collateral. Despite these safeguards, we cannot assure you that these measures will be sufficient to protect us from a default or that we will not be materially and adversely affected in the event of a significant default. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk Although our foreign operations have expanded as a result of recent business combinations, our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk resulting from ongoing foreign operations is not expected to be material to our financial condition or operating results. We are also exposed to foreign exchange rate risk related to the equity investments noted under Equity Price Risk. Any foreign currency exchange rate risk related to these investments is reflected in the Equity Price Risk section below. 84 Equity Price Risk We hold certain investments in equity securities for strategic purposes. Investments subject to equity price risks are generally recorded as available for sale at their fair value. Equity securities whose sale is restricted for greater than 12 months are carried at original cost, net of impairment charges, until the restriction is within 12 months of expiration at which time they are recorded at fair value. Fair values for publicly-traded equity investments are based on quoted market prices. Fair values are subject to fluctuation and, consequently, the amount realized in the subsequent sale of an investment may differ significantly from its current reported value. Fluctuation in the market price of a security may result from perceived changes in the underlying economic characteristics of the issuer, the relative price of alternative investments and general market conditions. The table below summarizes our equity investments at December 31, 2009. Equity investments are included in other assets in our consolidated balance sheets. (dollars in millions) CostBasis FairValue CarryingValue UnrealizedGain (Loss),Net of Tax BM&FBOVESPA S.A. $ 262.9 $ 710.8 $ 262.9 $ 270.5 (1) TMX Group Inc. 46.0 44.4 44.4 (1.0 ) IMAREX ASA 19.0 (2) 21.8 21.8 1.7 (1) In February 2008, we exchanged 1.2 million shares of CME Group Class A common stock for 101.1 million shares in BM&FBOVESPA. The company may not sell its shares in BM&FBOVESPA for four years after the purchase date. As a result, BM&FBOVESPA stock is reported in other assets at original cost less impairment loss until within 12 months of the restriction lapsing, after which time the stock will be accounted for as an available-for-sale security. The unrealized gain is currently not recorded. In addition, the unrealized gain does not take into account an unrealized loss of $81.7 million, net of tax, resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, which has been recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) upon recognizing impairment on the investment in December 2008. (2) During the third quarter of 2009, the company recorded an other-than-temporary impairment on its investment in IMAREX ASA. This resulted in an impairment charge of $22.4 million, which reduced our cost basis from $41.4 million to $19.0 million. We do not currently hedge against equity price risk. Equity investments are assessed for other-than-temporary impairment on a quarterly basis. An assessment of whether an equity investment is other-than-temporarily impaired takes into consideration the magnitude and duration of the unrealized loss. At December 31, 2009, we determined that none of the equity investments listed above were other-than-temporarily impaired. 85",2023-12-30 20:16:41.664704

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS INTRODUCTION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is organized as follows: • Overview: Includes a discussion of our business structure; current economic and industry-wide trends relevant to our business; our current business strategy; and our primary sources of operating and non-operating revenues and expenditures. • Critical Accounting Policies: Provides an explanation of accounting policies which may have a significant impact on our financial results and the estimates, assumptions and risks associated with those policies. • Recent Accounting Pronouncements: Includes an evaluation of recent accounting pronouncements and the potential impact of their future adoption on our financial results. • Results of Operations: Includes a discussion of our 2010, 2009 and 2008 financial results and any known events or trends which are likely to impact future results. • Liquidity and Capital Resources: Includes a discussion of our future cash requirements, capital resources, significant planned expenditures and financing arrangements. On March 23, 2008, CME Group acquired Credit Market Analysis Ltd., a private company incorporated in the United Kingdom, and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (collectively, CMA). On August 22, 2008, NYMEX Holdings, Inc. (NYMEX Holdings) merged with CME Group. On March 18, 2010, Board of Trade of the City of Chicago, Inc. (CBOT) acquired a 90% ownership interest in CME Group Index Services LLC (Index Services), a joint venture with Dow Jones & Company (Dow Jones). The following Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations includes the financial results of CMA beginning March 24, 2008, the financial results of the former NYMEX Holdings beginning August 23, 2008 and the financial results of Index Services beginning March 19, 2010. References in this discussion and analysis to “we” and “our” are to CME Group Inc. (CME Group) and its consolidated subsidiaries, collectively. References to “exchange” are to Chicago Mercantile Exchange Inc. (CME), CBOT and New York Mercantile Exchange, Inc. (NYMEX), collectively. OVERVIEW Business Structure CME Group, a Delaware stock corporation, is the holding company for CME, CBOT, NYMEX and their respective subsidiaries. The holding company structure is designed to provide strategic and operational flexibility. CME Group’s Class A common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market (NASDAQ) under the ticker symbol “CME.” Our exchange consists of designated contract markets for the trading of futures and options on futures contracts as well as clearing over-the-counter contracts. Futures contracts and options on futures contracts provide investors with vehicles for protecting against, and potentially profiting from, price changes in financial instruments and physical commodities. We are a global exchange with customer access available virtually all over the world. Our customers consist of professional traders, financial institutions, individual and institutional investors, major corporations, manufacturers, producers and governments. Customers include both members of the exchange and non-members. 38 Table of Contents We offer our customers the opportunity to trade futures contracts and options on futures contracts on a range of products including those based on interest rates, equities, foreign exchange, agricultural commodities, energy, and metals. Our products provide a means for hedging, speculating and allocating assets. We identify new products by monitoring economic trends and their impact on the risk management and speculative needs of our existing and prospective customers. Our major product lines are traded through our electronic trading platform and our open outcry trading floors. These execution facilities offer our customers immediate trade execution and price transparency. In addition, trades can be executed through privately negotiated transactions that are cleared and settled through our clearing house. Our clearing house clears, settles and guarantees every futures and options contract traded through our exchange, in addition to cleared over-the-counter products, including credit default swaps and interest rate swaps. Our clearing house performance guarantee is an important function of our business. Because of this guarantee, our customers do not need to evaluate the credit of each potential counterparty or limit themselves to a selected set of counterparties. This flexibility increases the potential liquidity available for each trade. Additionally, the substitution of our clearing house as the counterparty to every transaction allows our customers to establish a position with one party and then to offset the position with another party. This contract offsetting process provides our customers with flexibility in establishing and adjusting positions and provides for performance bond efficiencies. To ensure performance of counterparties, we establish and monitor financial requirements of our clearing firms. We also establish minimum performance bond requirements for our exchange-traded products and over-the-counter products. We mark-to-market all open positions at least twice a day and require payment from clearing firms whose positions have lost value and make payments to clearing firms whose positions have gained value. For product offerings within new markets, positions are marked-to-market daily, with the capability to mark-to-market more frequently as market conditions warrant. We maintain a financial safeguard package to be used in the event of default of a clearing firm for our futures, options or cleared over-the-counter credit default swap contracts. In the unlikely event of a payment default by a clearing firm for our futures, options or cleared over-the-counter credit default swap contracts, we would first apply assets of the defaulting clearing firm to satisfy its payment obligation. These assets include the defaulting firm’s guaranty fund contributions, performance bonds and any other available assets, such as assets required for membership and any associated trading rights. In addition, we would make a demand for payment pursuant to any applicable guarantee provided to the exchange by the parent company of a clearing firm. Thereafter, if the payment default remains unsatisfied, we would use, in order, CME’s surplus funds, guaranty fund contributions of other clearing firms and funds collected through an assessment against solvent clearing firms to satisfy the deficit. Surplus funds represent the amount of CME working capital reduced by an amount necessary to support normal operations and amounts designated by CME for our interest rate swap financial safeguard package. We maintain a separate financial safeguard package to support our cleared over-the-counter interest rate swap products. This separate interest rate swaps financial safeguard package is independent of our financial safeguard package for our futures, options or cleared over-the-counter credit default swaps and is isolated to clearing firms for our interest rate swap products. This financial safeguard package includes a separate guaranty fund, risk committee and default management procedures. We have also designated an additional $100.0 million of CME working capital to be used in the event of default of one of the clearing firms for interest rate swap contracts after the defaulting clearing firm assets have been applied. Industry Trends Economic Environment. Despite the recent economic volatility, our customers continue to use our markets as an effective and transparent means to manage risk. Over the last few years, trading activity in our centralized markets has fluctuated due to the ongoing uncertainty in the financial markets, fluctuations in the availability of 39 Table of Contents credit, variations in the amount of assets under management as well as the Federal Reserve Bank’s continued zero interest rate policy. We continue to maintain quality products and services which support our customers in any economic environment. Competitive Environment. We operate in a highly competitive industry and expect competition to continue to intensify, especially after a recent consolidation of exchanges and new entrants to the markets we serve. We encounter competition in all aspects of our business. Competition is influenced by liquidity and transparency of the markets, variability in fee structures, breadth of product offerings including quality of new product development as well as efficient and innovative technology. We now face competition from other futures, securities and securities option exchanges; over-the-counter markets; clearing organizations; consortia formed by our members and large market participants; alternative trade execution facilities; technology firms, including market data distributors and electronic trading system developers; and others. Regulatory Environment. Our operations as a futures exchange have historically been subject to extensive regulation. In light of widespread difficulties across the economy, particularly acute in the latter half of 2008 and early 2009, there have been many calls for a restructuring of the regulation of financial markets. In July 2010, the Dodd-Frank Act was signed into law. The Dodd-Frank Act is a comprehensive banking and financial services reform package that includes significant changes to the oversight of the derivatives markets, both over-the-counter and exchange-traded. While we believe that the new regulations will provide opportunities for our business, the new regulations are subject to extensive rulemaking by various regulators. To the extent the regulatory environment following the implementation of the new legislation and other financial reform regulations is less beneficial for us or our customers, our business, financial condition and operating results could be negatively affected. Business Strategy Our strategy focuses on leveraging our benchmark products, enhancing our customer relations, expanding our customer base, advancing our clearing and trading technologies, and deriving benefits from our integrated clearing house as well as our scalable infrastructure. We specifically focus our strategy on capitalizing on opportunities created by increased market awareness and acceptance of derivatives, increased price volatility, technological advances and the increasing need for counterparty risk mitigation and clearing services. This strategy allows us to continue to develop into a more broadly diversified financial exchange that provides trading and clearing solutions across a wide range of products and asset classes. We believe that we can build on our competitive strengths by implementing the following strategies: • Grow our core business through expansion of our existing benchmark product lines and new product offerings as well as improvement of our customer relations in order to cross-sell our products; • Globalize our business by expanding and diversifying our worldwide customer base through strategic investments and relationships with other key exchanges around the world, which allows us to accelerate our market penetration and improve product sales channels; • Provide a comprehensive multi-asset class clearing solution to the over-the-counter market that maximizes operational efficiency, as well as expand our over-the-counter product offerings; and • Establish ourselves as the leading exchange company provider of information products and index services, which would allow us to create additional cross-listing opportunities and new opportunities for index creation. It will also allow us to create opportunities for licensing across the global market as well as expanding market data dissemination services to our global network of clients and exchange partners. Primary Sources of Revenue Clearing and transaction fees. A majority of our revenue is derived from clearing and transaction fees, which include electronic trading fees, surcharges for privately-negotiated transactions and other volume-related charges for contracts executed through our trading venues. Because clearing and transaction fees are assessed on a 40 Table of Contents per-contract basis, revenues and profitability fluctuate with changes in trading volume. In addition to the industry trends noted earlier, our revenues and trading volume tend to increase during periods of economic and geopolitical uncertainty as our customers seek to manage their exposure to, or speculate on, the market volatility resulting from uncertainty. While volume has the most significant impact on our clearing and transaction fees revenue, there are four other factors that also influence this source of revenues: • rate structure; • product mix; • trading venue; and • the percentage of trades executed by customers who are members compared with non-member customers. Rate structure. Customers benefit from volume discounts and limits on fees as part of our effort to increase liquidity in certain products. We offer various incentive programs to promote trading in various products and geographic locations. We may periodically change fees, volume discounts, limits on fees and member discounts, perhaps significantly, based on our review of operations and the business environment. For example, we have an incentive program in place to provide fee incentives to international trading firms that trade our products electronically. Product mix. We offer trading of futures and options on futures contracts on a wide-ranging set of products based on interest rates, equities, foreign exchange, agricultural commodities, energy and metals. Rates are varied by product in order to optimize revenue on existing products and to encourage trading volume upon introduction of new products. Trading venue. Our exchange is an international marketplace that brings together buyers and sellers mainly through our electronic trading platform as well as through open outcry trading on our trading floors and privately negotiated transactions. Any customer who is guaranteed by a clearing firm and who agrees to be bound by our exchange rules is able to obtain direct access to our electronic platform. Open outcry trading is conducted exclusively by our members, who may execute trades on behalf of customers or for themselves. Typically, customers executing trades through our electronic platform are charged fees for using the platform in addition to the fees assessed on all transactions executed on our exchange. Customers entering into privately negotiated transactions also incur additional charges beyond the fees assessed on all transactions. Privately negotiated transactions include block trades, which are large transactions that are executed between selected parties off the public auction market on CME Globex or the trading floor. Member/non-member mix. Generally, member customers are charged lower fees than our non-member customers. Holding all other factors constant, revenue decreases if the percentage of trades executed by members increases, and increases if the percentage of non-member trades increases. Other sources. Revenue is also derived from other sources including market data and information services, access and communication fees and various services related to our exchange and building operations. Market data and information services. We receive market data and information services revenue from the dissemination of our market data to subscribers. Subscribers can obtain access to our market data services either directly or through third-party distributors. Our service offerings include access to real-time, delayed and end-of-day quotation, trade and summary market data for our products and other data sources. Users of our basic service receive real-time quotes and pay a flat monthly fee for each screen, or device, displaying our market data. Alternatively, customers can subscribe to market data provided on a limited group of products. The fee for this service is also a flat rate per month. 41 Table of Contents Pricing for our market data services is based on the value of the service provided, our cost structure for the service and the price of comparable services offered by our competitors. Increases or decreases in our market data and information services revenue are influenced by changes in our price structure for existing market data offerings, introduction of new market data services and changes in the number of devices in use. General economic factors that affect the financial services industry, which constitutes our primary customer base, also influence revenue from our market data services. On March 18, 2010, CBOT and Dow Jones entered into an agreement to form Index Services. Index Services was formed through the contribution of CBOT’s market data business and Dow Jones’ index business. Index Services generates market data and information services revenue through licensing of its trademark indexes as well as through calculation and distribution of its market data. Access and communication fees. Access and communication fees are the connectivity charges to customers of the CME Globex platform to our market data vendors and to direct market data customers as well as charges to members and clearing firms that utilize our various telecommunications networks and communications services, including our co-location initiatives. Access fee revenue varies depending on the type of connection provided to customers. Revenue from communication fees is dependent on open outcry trading, as a significant portion relates to telecommunications on our trading floors. Other revenues. Other revenues include rent charged to third party tenants as well as ancillary charges for utilities, parking and miscellaneous services provided to tenants. We maintain three commercial buildings in Chicago’s central business district. We rent retail and office space to third party tenants, including exchange customers. We also maintain office space in New York City that is rented to third party tenants, including exchange customers. All tenants pay market rates for rent. Revenues related to our real estate operations are generally affected by market rental rates, lease renewals and business conditions in the financial services industry in which most of our tenants operate. To further diversify the range of services we offer, we have entered into processing and development agreements with other exchanges and service organizations. Prior to our merger with NYMEX Holdings in August 2008, we collected fees from NYMEX for listing energy and metal futures products on the CME Globex platform. In 2010, we entered into an agreement with BM&FBOVESPA S.A (BM&FBOVESPA) to develop a new multi-asset class electronic trading platform for their customers. We recognize revenue under this agreement as services are provided and when developed technology is delivered. Additionally, other revenues include fees for administrating our Interest Earnings Facility (IEF) program, trade order routing, and various services to members and clearing firms. We offer clearing firms the opportunity to invest cash performance bonds in our various IEF offerings. These clearing firms receive interest income, and we receive a fee based on total funds on deposit. In addition, other revenues include trading gains and losses generated by GFX Corporation (GFX), our wholly-owned subsidiary that trades foreign exchange futures contracts to enhance liquidity in our electronic markets for these products. Primary Expenses The majority of our expenses do not vary directly with changes in our trading volume. Licensing and other fee agreements expense and the majority of our employee bonuses do vary directly with trading volume. Compensation and benefits. Compensation and benefits expense is our most significant expense and includes employee wages, bonuses, stock-based compensation, benefits and employer taxes. Changes in this expense are driven by fluctuations in the number of employees, increases in wages as a result of inflation or labor market conditions, changes in rates for employer taxes and other cost increases affecting benefit plans. In addition, this expense is affected by the composition of our work force. The expense associated with our bonus and stock-based compensation plans can also have a significant impact on this expense category and may vary from year to year. 42 Table of Contents The bonus component of our compensation and benefits expense is based on our financial performance. Under the performance criteria of our annual incentive plans, the bonus funded under the plans is based on achieving certain financial performance targets established by the compensation committee of our board of directors. The compensation committee may adjust the target level of performance for material, unplanned revenue, expense or capital expenditures to meet intermediate to long-term growth opportunities. Stock-based compensation is a non-cash expense related to stock options, restricted stock and performance share grants. Stock-based compensation varies depending on the quantity and fair value of awards granted. The fair value of options is derived using the Black-Scholes model with assumptions about our dividend yield, the expected volatility of our stock price based on an analysis of implied and historical volatility, the risk-free interest rate and the expected life of the options granted. The fair value of other awards is based on the share price on the date of the grant. Amortization of purchased intangibles. This expense primarily includes amortization of intangible assets obtained in our mergers with CBOT Holdings and NYMEX Holdings as well as other asset and business acquisitions. Intangible assets subject to amortization consist primarily of customer relationships, licensing agreements, and lease-related intangible assets. Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense results from the depreciation of long-lived assets purchased, as well as the amortization of purchased and internally developed software. Other expenses. We incur additional ongoing expenses for communications, technology support services and various other activities necessary to support our operations. • Communications expense includes costs for network connections to our electronic trading platform and some market data customers; telecommunications costs of our exchange; and fees paid for access to external market data. This expense may be impacted by growth in electronic trading, our capacity requirements and changes in the number of telecommunications hubs and connections which allow customers outside the United States access to our electronic trading platform directly. • Technology support services consist of costs related to maintenance of the hardware and software required to support our technology. Our technology support services costs are driven by system capacity, functionality and redundancy requirements. • Professional fees and outside services expense includes costs of consulting services provided for major strategic and technology initiatives as well as legal and accounting fees. This expense may fluctuate as a result of changes in services required to complete initiatives and legal proceedings. • Occupancy and building operations expense consists of costs related to leased and owned property including rent, maintenance, real estate taxes, utilities and other related costs. We have significant operations located in Chicago and New York City with smaller offices in located throughout Europe, North and South America, the Middle East and Asia. Additionally, we have trading facilities in Chicago and New York City as well as data centers in various U.S. locations. • Licensing and other fee agreements expense includes license fees paid as a result of trading volume in equity index products, and royalty and broker rebates on metals and energy products, subsequent to the merger with NYMEX Holdings. This expense fluctuates with changes in equity index product volume as well as CME ClearPort volumes and fee structure changes in the agreements. • Restructuring expense includes transitional employees’ severance, retention bonuses and associated payroll taxes as well as outplacement costs and post-employment healthcare subsidies resulting from our mergers with CBOT Holdings in July 2007 and with NYMEX Holdings in August 2008. • Other expenses include marketing-related as well as general and administrative costs. Marketing, advertising and public relations expense includes media, print and other advertising costs, as well as costs associated with our product promotion. Other expenses also include litigation and customer settlements as well as impairment of operational assets. 43 Table of Contents Non-Operating Income and Expenses Income and expenses incurred through activities outside of our core operations are considered non-operating. These activities include investments in debt and equity securities for operational and strategic purposes, financing activities and our securities lending program. • Investment income represents income generated by short-term investment of excess cash, clearing firms’ cash performance bonds and guaranty fund contributions; income and net realized gains and losses from our marketable securities; gains and losses on trading securities in our non-qualified deferred compensation plans and dividend income from our strategic investments. Investment income is influenced by the availability of funds generated by operations, market interest rates and changes in the levels of cash performance bonds deposited by clearing firms. • We use derivative financial instruments for the purpose of hedging exposures to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. Any ineffective or excluded portion of our hedges is recognized in earnings immediately. • CME’s securities lending program has been suspended since November 2008. NYMEX’s securities lending program was terminated in June 2009. Under the securities lending program, we lend a portion of the securities that clearing firms deposit with us and we receive collateral in the form of cash in return. The cash is invested in bank money market mutual funds, overnight repurchase agreements, corporate debt securities or other asset-back securities to generate interest income. The balance of securities on deposit fluctuates as a result of changes in the clearing firms’ open positions and how clearing firms elect to satisfy their performance bond requirements. Securities lending interest expense represents the payment to the borrower of the security for the cash retained during the duration of the lending transaction. Net interest income from securities lending is impacted by changes in short-term interest rates and the level of demand for the securities on deposit. • Interest and other borrowing costs are associated with various short-term and long-term funding facilities. We maintain a commercial paper program with various financial institutions. In 2008, we issued short-term and long-term debt in conjunction with our merger with NYMEX Holdings. In early 2009, we refinanced part of the debt that was previously issued for the NYMEX Holdings merger. In conjunction with its formation, Index Services issued long-term debt in March 2010. Our debt is effectively fixed rate debt, but some debt-related costs fluctuate with the funding needs of our business. • Income related to our guarantee of exercise right privileges (ERPs) was a result of our merger with CBOT Holdings. Under the terms of the merger agreement, eligible holders of Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) ERPs could elect to sell us their ERP for $250,000 per privilege. Eligible holders that did not elect to sell their ERPs were entitled to a maximum guaranteed payment of $250,000 from us upon resolution of the lawsuit between CBOT and CBOE. This income represented the change in estimated fair value of our guarantee during the period, which was based in part on the expected outcome of the litigation. This litigation was resolved in December 2009. • Equity in net losses of unconsolidated subsidiaries includes income and losses from our investments in Dubai Mercantile Exchange (DME), Green Exchange Holdings, LLC, Bursa Malaysia Derivatives Berhad (Bursa Derivatives), OneChicago LLC (OneChicago) and FXMarketSpace Limited (FXMS). CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The notes to our consolidated financial statements include disclosure of our significant accounting policies. In establishing these policies within the framework of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, management must make certain assessments, estimates and choices that will result in the application of these principles in a manner that appropriately reflects our financial condition and results of operations. Critical accounting policies are those policies that we believe present the most complex or subjective measurements and have the most potential to affect our financial position and operating results. While all decisions regarding 44 Table of Contents accounting policies are important, there are certain accounting policies that we consider to be critical. These critical policies, which are presented in detail in the notes to our consolidated financial statements, relate to valuation of financial instruments, goodwill and intangible assets, derivative instruments, revenue recognition, income taxes, and internal use software costs. Valuation of financial instruments. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, or an exit price. A hierarchy exists for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the observable inputs be used when available. Observable inputs are inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on market data obtained from independent sources. Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect our assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances. We have categorized financial instruments measured at fair value into a three-level classification hierarchy. Classification is based on the reliability of inputs as follows: • Level 1—Inputs are unadjusted, quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date. Assets and liabilities carried at level 1 fair value generally include U.S. Treasury and Government agency securities, equity securities listed in active markets, and investments in publicly traded mutual funds with quoted market prices. • Level 2—Inputs are either directly or indirectly observable and corroborated by market data or are based on quoted prices in markets that are not active. Assets and liabilities carried at level 2 fair value generally include municipal bonds, corporate debt and certain derivatives. • Level 3—Inputs are unobservable and reflect management’s best estimate of what market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. Generally assets and liabilities at fair value utilizing level 3 inputs include certain other assets and liabilities with inputs that require management’s judgment. For further discussion regarding the fair value of financial assets and liabilities, see note 24 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Goodwill and intangible assets. We review goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment on an annual basis and whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Goodwill is assessed for impairment using a two-step test. In the first step, the fair value of each reporting unit is compared to its carrying amount. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying amount, no impairment exists and we are not required to perform further testing. If the carrying amount exceeds its fair value, the second step must be performed to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill. If the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, then an impairment loss is recorded in an amount equal to that excess. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. Valuation techniques we use to measure fair value include the market approach and the income approach. The market approach encompasses comparable data sets within our peer group, and the income approach includes discounted cash flow measurements using a market discount rate. Our valuation techniques could yield variable results based on changes in assumptions such as the discount rate and long-term growth rate and forecasted revenue and expense. Our annual impairment analysis indicated a fair value for CMA that was below its book value as a result of adverse economic conditions. Accordingly, in June 2010, a $19.8 million impairment loss was charged against earnings. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are assessed for impairment by comparing their fair values to their carrying values. If the carrying value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the difference. The estimate of the fair value of all intangible assets is generally determined on the basis of discounted future cash flows. In estimating the fair value, management must make assumptions 45 Table of Contents and projections regarding such items as the discount rate, long-term growth rate, forecasted revenue and expenses, and other factors. Such assumptions are subject to change as a result of changing economic and competitive conditions. Intangible assets subject to amortization are also evaluated for impairment when indicated by a change in economic or operational circumstances. The impairment testing requires management to first compare the book value of the amortizing asset to undiscounted cash flows. If the book value exceeds the undiscounted cash flows, management is then required to estimate the fair value of the assets and record an impairment loss for the excess of the carrying value over the fair value. Derivative investments. We use derivative financial instruments for the purpose of hedging exposures to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. Derivatives are recorded at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets. Changes in our derivatives’ fair values are recognized in earnings unless the instruments are accounted for as hedges. For a derivative designated as a fair value hedge, any gain or loss on the derivative is recognized in earnings in the period of change, to the extent the hedge is effective, together with the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the risk being hedged. We record the effective portions of our derivative financial instruments that are designated as cash flow hedges in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. When the hedged item affects earnings, the gain or loss included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) is transferred to the same line in the consolidated statements of income as the hedged item. Any ineffective or excluded portion of a hedge is recognized in earnings immediately. Any realized gains and losses from effective hedges are classified in the consolidated statements of income consistent with the accounting treatment of the items being hedged. Revenue recognition. Over 75% of our revenue is derived from the clearing and transaction fees we assess on each contract executed through our trading venues and cleared through our clearing house. Clearing and transaction fees are recognized as revenue when a buy and sell order are matched and when the trade is cleared. On occasion, the customer’s exchange trading privileges may not be properly entered by the clearing firm and incorrect fees are charged for the transactions in the affected accounts. When this information is corrected within the time period allowed by the exchange, a fee adjustment is provided to the clearing firm. An accrual is established for estimated fee adjustments to reflect corrections to customer exchange trading privileges. The accrual is based on the historical pattern of adjustments processed as well as specific adjustment requests. Occasionally market data customers will pay for services in a lump sum payment. When these circumstances occur, revenue is recognized as services are provided. Income taxes. Calculation of the income tax provision includes an estimate of the income taxes that will be paid for the current year as well as an estimate of income tax liabilities or benefits deferred into future years. Deferred tax assets are reviewed to determine if they will be realized in future periods. To the extent it is determined that some deferred tax assets may not be fully realized, the assets are reduced to their realizable value by a valuation allowance. The calculation of our tax provision involves uncertainty in the application of complex tax regulations. We recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the United States and other applicable tax jurisdictions using a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold based on the technical merits of the tax position taken or expected to be taken. If payment of these amounts varies from our estimate, our income tax provision would be reduced or increased at the time that determination is made. This determination may not be known for several years. Past tax audits have not resulted in tax adjustments that would result in a material change to the income tax provision in the year the audit was completed. The effective tax rate, defined as the income tax provision as a percentage of income before income taxes, will vary from year to year based on changes in tax jurisdictions, tax rates and regulations. In addition, the effective tax rate will vary with changes to income that are not subject to income tax, such as municipal interest income, and changes in expenses or losses that are not deductible, such as the utilization of foreign net operating losses. Internal use software costs. Certain costs for employees and consultants that are incurred in connection with work on development or implementation of software for our internal use are capitalized. Costs capitalized are for application development or implementation for software projects that will result in significant new functionality 46 Table of Contents and that are generally expected to cost in excess of $0.5 million. The amount capitalized is determined based on the time spent by the individuals completing the eligible software-related activity and the compensation and benefits or consulting fees incurred for these activities. Projects are monitored during the development cycle to assure that they continue to meet the capitalization criteria and that the project will be completed and placed in service as intended. Any previously capitalized costs are expensed at the time a decision is made to abandon a software project. Completed internal use software projects, as well as work-in-progress projects, are included as part of property in the consolidated balance sheets. Once complete, the accumulated costs for a particular software project are amortized over the anticipated life of the software, generally three years. Costs capitalized for internal use software will vary from year to year based on our technology-related business requirements. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 2010 Financial Highlights The comparability of our operating results for the periods presented is significantly impacted by our merger with NYMEX Holdings in August 2008 as well as the creation of Index Services in March 2010. In the discussion and analysis that follows, we have quantified the incremental revenue or expense resulting from the NYMEX transaction wherever such amounts were material and identifiable. While identified amounts may provide indications of general trends, the analysis cannot completely address the effects attributable to integration efforts. The following summarizes significant changes in our financial performance for the years presented. Year-over-Year Change (dollars in millions, except per share data) 2010 2009 2008 2010-2009 2009-2008 Total revenues $ 3,003.7 $ 2,612.8 $ 2,561.0 15 % 2 % Total expenses 1,172.6 1,023.7 978.8 15 5 Operating margin 61 % 61 % 62 % Non-operating income (expense) $ (109.2 ) $ (151.6 ) $ (334.2 ) (28 ) (55 ) Effective tax rate 45 % 43 % 43 % Net income attributable to CME Group $ 951.4 $ 825.8 $ 715.5 15 15 Diluted earnings per common share attributable to CME Group 14.31 12.41 12.13 15 2 Cash flows from operating activities 1,356.4 1,083.1 1,197.2 25 (10 ) • The increase in revenues from 2008 to 2010 was attributable to an increase in contract volume as well as an increase in market data and information services revenue, due in part to our merger with NYMEX Holdings in August 2008. • From 2008 to 2010, higher compensation and benefits, amortization of purchased intangibles as well as professional fees and outside services contributed to an increase in expenses, due in part to our merger with NYMEX Holdings in August 2008. • We experienced a decrease in non-operating income (expense) from 2008 to 2010 due to an impairment charge on our investment in BM&FBOVESPA of $274.5 million in 2008 as well as aggregate impairment charges of $46.0 million related to IMAREX ASA (IMAREX) and DME in 2009. This decrease in expense was partially offset by an increase in interest expense and other borrowing costs from 2008 to 2010 due to an increase in average debt outstanding resulting from our merger with NYMEX Holdings in August 2008. • The effective tax rate increased in 2010 compared with 2009 due to a $51.2 million charge to record the impact of our new combined state and local tax rate on our existing deferred tax liabilities. Our state and local tax rate increased due to revised state apportionment estimates resulting from annual state tax filings. The 2009 effective tax rate remained consistent with 2008. An additional valuation allowance related to unrealized capital losses increased the effective tax rate in 2009. However, this increase was offset by the favorable impact of a New York City tax law change in 2009. • Cash flows from operations are strongly correlated with trading volume. 47 Table of Contents Revenues Year-over-Year Change (dollars in millions) 2010 2009 2008 2010-2009 2009-2008 Clearing and transaction fees $ 2,486.3 $ 2,161.9 $ 2,115.4 15 % 2 % Market data and information services 395.1 331.1 279.5 19 18 Access and communication fees 45.4 45.6 43.6 — 4 Other 76.9 74.2 122.5 4 (39 ) Total Revenues $ 3,003.7 $ 2,612.8 $ 2,561.0 15 2 Clearing and Transaction Fees The following table summarizes our total contract volume, revenue and average rate per contract. Total contract volume includes contracts that are traded on our exchange and cleared through our clearing house. Contract volume also includes cleared-only CME ClearPort contracts. Volume is measured in round turns, which is considered a completed transaction which involves a purchase and an offsetting sale of a contract. Average rate per contract is determined by dividing total clearing and transaction fee revenue by total contract volume. All amounts exclude our TRAKRS, HuRLO, Swapstream, credit default swaps and interest rate swaps. Year-over-Year Change 2010 2009 2008 2010-2009 2009-2008 Total volume (in millions) 3,078.1 2,584.9 2,978.5 19 % (13 )% Clearing and transaction fees (in millions) $ 2,486.3 $ 2,161.7 $ 2,114.7 15 2 Average rate per contract 0.808 0.836 0.710 (3 ) 18 We estimate the following increases (decreases) in clearing and transaction fees based on change in total volume and change in average rate per contract. Year-over-Year Change (in millions) 2010-2009 2009-2008 Increase (decrease) due to change in total volume $ 398.5 $ (329.1 ) Increase (decrease) due to change in average rate per contract (73.9 ) 376.1 Net increase in clearing and transaction fees $ 324.6 $ 47.0 Average rate per contract is impacted by our rate structure, which includes volume-based incentives; product mix; trading venue; and the percentage of volume executed by customers who are members compared with non-member customers. Due to the relationship between average rate per contract and volume, the change in revenues attributable to changes in each is only an approximation. 48 Table of Contents Contract Volume The following table summarizes average daily contract volume. NYMEX product and CME ClearPort services volume in 2008 have been calculated for the period from August 23 through December 31, 2008. Year-over-Year Change (amounts in thousands) 2010 2009 2008 2010-2009 2009-2008 Average Daily Volume by Product Line: Interest rate 5,449 4,260 6,085 28 % (30 )% Equity 2,907 2,916 3,663 — (20 ) Foreign exchange 919 624 623 47 — Agricultural commodity 914 741 848 23 (13 ) Energy 1,662 1,492 1,348 11 11 Metal 316 225 208 40 8 Aggregate average daily volume 12,167 10,258 12,775 19 (20 ) Average Daily Volume by Venue: Electronic 10,120 8,290 10,180 22 (19 ) Open outcry 1,402 1,310 1,943 7 (33 ) Privately negotiated 198 164 208 21 (21 ) Total exchange-traded volume 11,720 9,764 12,331 20 (21 ) Total CME ClearPort 447 494 444 (10 ) 11 Aggregate average daily volume 12,167 10,258 12,775 19 (20 ) Electronic Volume as a Percentage of Average Daily Volume 83 % 81 % 80 % Interest Rate Products The following table summarizes average daily volume for our key interest rate products. Year-over-Year Change (amounts in thousands) 2010 2009 2008 2010-2009 2009-2008 Eurodollar futures 2,020 1,736 2,360 16 % (26 )% Eurodollar options 726 639 903 14 (29 ) U.S. Treasury futures and options: 10-Year 1,380 913 1,239 51 (26 ) 5-Year 546 410 715 33 (43 ) 30-Year 388 292 427 33 (32 ) 2-Year 274 201 323 37 (38 ) The increase in overall interest rate product volume in 2010 when compared with 2009 was attributable to the overall improvement in the economic environment in 2010 following the credit crisis. Specifically, in the second half of 2010, a continuing zero interest rate policy in the United States and the Federal Reserve’s announcement that it will buy additional U.S. Treasury securities to stimulate the economy led to changing expectations about interest rates as well as increased market participants’ use of these products. The change in expectations contributed to an increase in volume for longer-term U.S. Treasury products which was only partially offset by slower growth in volume for short-term Eurodollar products. We believe that the increase in overall Eurodollar products volume in 2010, when compared with 2009, resulted from uncertainty surrounding the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) due to the European credit crisis throughout early 2010. In addition, changing expectations about the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy led to increased volume for longer-dated Eurodollar products. In 2010, when compared with 2009, we believe that the increase in U.S. Treasury note futures and options volume was attributable to the additional U.S. Treasury note issuance by the U.S. government as well as rising 49 Table of Contents intermediate and long-term interest rates. In early 2010, we introduced the Ultra U.S. Treasury bond contract, which generated an average of 31,000 contracts per day since launch. We believe that the decrease in Eurodollar products volume in 2009 when compared with 2008 was attributable to the zero interest rate policy and increased risk aversion by market participants following the credit crisis within the United States. We believe this reduced certain customers’ ability or need to assume and maintain positions during 2009. We believe that the overall decline in U.S. Treasury note futures and options volume in 2009 when compared with 2008 was attributable to the credit crisis within the United States, which resulted in reduced corporate debt issuances, reduced mortgage issuances and refinancing activity, a slowdown in the U.S. Treasury cash market trading as well as the Federal Reserve Bank’s purchase of U.S. Treasury securities. The decline in 2009 when compared with 2008 was also attributable to the zero interest rate policy, which we believe reduced market participants’ need to hedge interest rate risk. Equity Products The following table summarizes average daily volume for our key equity futures and options products. Year-over-Year Change (amounts in thousands) 2010 2009 2008 2010-2009 2009-2008 E-mini S&P 500 2,300 2,284 2,597 1 % (12 )% E-mini NASDAQ 100 317 311 432 2 (28 ) Russell (volume through September 19, 2008) — — 261 — (100 ) In 2010 when compared with 2009, growth in equity products volume was relatively flat. We believe an improved economic outlook leading to increased investment in the equities market contributed to an increase in volume in 2010. This increase was offset by a decrease in volume attributable to a decline in average volatility for equity products, as measured by the CBOE Volatility Index, in 2010 when compared with 2009. We believe that equity product volume decreased in 2009 when compared with 2008 due to the decline in volatility, as measured by the CBOE Volatility Index. Average volatility decreased starting in the beginning of 2009 through the end of 2009. In addition, the decline in volume was attributable to the termination of our license to list Russell-based contracts. Foreign Exchange Products The following table summarizes average daily volume for our key foreign exchange futures and options products. Year-over-Year Change (amounts in thousands) 2010 2009 2008 2010-2009 2009-2008 Euro 367 225 223 63 % 1 % Japanese yen 131 93 133 41 (30 ) British pound 124 100 83 24 21 Australian dollar 105 68 45 55 50 Canadian dollar 91 63 46 43 36 We believe that the increase in volume in 2010, when compared with 2009, was attributable to the weakening of the Euro and British pound compared with the U.S. dollar. Uncertainty surrounding the Euro following the European credit crisis contributed to increased volatility, which led to increased trading volume for the Euro products in 2010 when compared with 2009. We also believe that the strengthening of the Yen compared with the U.S. dollar contributed to an increase in volume. In addition, our cross-selling efforts to market participants in other asset classes as well as increased global sales presence contributed to growth in volume. 50 Table of Contents In 2009 when compared with 2008, we believe that the convergence of interest rates towards zero between the European, United States and Japanese markets led to flat volume for our Euro products and a decline in volume for our Japanese yen products. The increase in volume for the British pound, Australian dollar and Canadian dollar products was attributable to a divergence between interest rates in the United States and interest rates in the British, Australian and Canadian markets. Agricultural Commodity Products The following table summarizes average daily volume for our key agricultural commodity futures and options products. Year-over-Year Change (amounts in thousands) 2010 2009 2008 2010-2009 2009-2008 Basic corn 358 259 320 38 % (19 )% Basic soybean 186 180 183 3 (1 ) Basic wheat 109 85 91 29 (7 ) We believe that the increase in average daily volume for our commodity products in 2010 when compared with 2009 was attributable to increased volatility associated with changes in global supply attributable to global weather events. In addition, increased demand for protein in emerging markets has increased demand for feedgrains. In 2009 when compared with 2008, we believe a decrease in commodity price volatility and decreased demand for commodities products as a result of the credit crisis within the United States caused the overall decline in volume for commodities products. We believe the credit crisis reduced certain customers’ ability or need to assume and maintain positions. Energy Products The following table summarizes average daily volume for our key energy futures and options products. Year-over-Year Change (amounts in thousands) 2010 2009 2008 2010-2009 2009-2008 Crude oil 853 712 738 20 % (4 )% Natural gas 489 478 519 2 (8 ) Refined products 244 194 175 26 11 Power 73 105 7 (31 ) n.m. n.m. not meaningful In 2010 when compared with 2009, we believe that the growth in volume was attributable to an improved economic outlook as well as increased liquidity within the energy futures market. We believe crude oil contract volume increased at a higher rate than natural gas contract volume due to an increase in volume generated from customers outside the United States as well as increased volatility in the crude oil market. We believe the increase in average daily volume in 2009 when compared with 2008 was due to market participants seeking to mitigate counterparty risk on their over-the-counter exposures through central counter party clearing. The table above includes volume for the period prior to our merger with NYMEX in 2008. Metal Products We believe that the increase in metal product volume in 2010 was attributable to increased investment in precious metals as an asset class during periods of uncertainty in interest rates and foreign exchange. In 2010 when compared with 2009, gold contract volume increased by 31% to an average of 0.2 million contracts per day. 51 Table of Contents In 2009 when compared with 2008, we believe metal products volume decreased, including the period prior to our merger, due to lower price volatility and decreased demand for metal products as a result of the credit crisis within the United States. In 2009 when compared with 2008, average daily volume for gold contract volume decreased by 6% to 0.2 million contracts per day. Average Rate per Contract The average rate per contract decreased in 2010 when compared with the same period in 2009 due to an increase in member trading volume, which increased faster than non-member trading in 2010. In general, members receive lower rates compared with non-members. In addition, the average rate per contract decreased due to a lower portion of equity and energy products as a percentage of total volume compared with interest rate products. As a percentage of volume, equity products volume decreased by 4% and energy product volume decreased by 1% while interest rate product volume increased by 3%. Equity and energy products have higher fees compared with interest rate products. In 2009 when compared with 2008, the average rate per contract increased due to the inclusion of a full year of volume from NYMEX products and CME ClearPort services, which had an average rate per contract of $1.512 and $2.051, respectively, in 2009. Additionally, the average rate per contract increased due to a lower portion of interest rate products as a percentage of total volume compared with equity products, which have a higher rate per contract. As a percentage of CME and CBOT volume, equity products volume increased by 2% in 2009, while interest rate products volume decreased by 4% when compared with 2008. Concentration of Revenue We bill a substantial portion of our clearing and transaction fees to our clearing firms. The majority of clearing and transaction fees received from clearing firms represent charges for trades executed and cleared on behalf of their customers. One firm represented 13% and one firm represented 12% of our clearing and transaction fees revenue in 2010. One firm represented 13% and one firm represented 11% of our clearing and transaction fees revenue in 2009. One firm represented 12% and one firm represented 10% of our clearing and transaction fees revenue in 2008. Should a clearing firm withdraw, we believe that the customer portion of the firm’s trading activity would likely transfer to another clearing firm of the exchange. Therefore, we do not believe we are exposed to significant risk from the loss of revenue received from a particular clearing firm. Other Sources of Revenue The increase in market data and information services revenue was principally due to market data and licensing revenue from Index Services, which began March 19, 2010. An increase in the basic device monthly fee in 2010 also contributed to an increase in revenues in 2010. Revenue generated from NYMEX increased by $59.2 million in 2009 when compared with 2008. In addition, revenues increased in 2009 when compared with 2008 due to additional revenue generated from CMA as well as an increase in data feed surcharges and vendor licensing fees. Year-over-year increases in screen counts generated by business combinations were partially offset by an overall decrease in screen counts for existing customers. Decreases in screen counts were due to cost-cutting initiatives at customer firms. The table below includes screen counts for CME, CBOT and NYMEX. Year-over-Year Change (dollars in millions, except monthly fee per device) 2010 2009 2008 2010-2009 2009-2008 Average estimated monthly basic device screen count 384,000 411,000 343,000 (27,000 ) 68,000 Basic device monthly fee per device $ 61 $ 55 $ 55 $ 6 $ — Estimated increase in revenues Due to an increase in monthly fee per device 27.7 — Due to an increase (decrease) in screen counts $ (17.5 ) $ 45.0 52 Table of Contents The two largest resellers of our market data represented approximately 45%, 55% and 56% of our market data and information services revenue in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Despite this concentration, we consider exposure to significant risk of revenue loss to be minimal. In the event that one of these vendors no longer subscribes to our market data, we believe the majority of that vendor’s customers would likely subscribe to our market data through another reseller. Additionally, several of our largest institutional customers that utilize services from our two largest resellers report usage and remit payment of their fees directly to us. Other revenues increased in 2010 when compared with 2009 due to $10.7 million of revenue generated from our agreement with BM&FBOVESPA to develop a new multi-asset class electronic trading platform and incremental processing services revenue generated from various strategic relationships. This was partially offset by a $6.3 million decline in trading revenues generated by GFX Corporation (GFX) resulting from lower trading activity and narrower trading margins. Other revenues decreased in 2009 compared with 2008 due to a decline in processing services revenue of $53.6 million. In 2008, we recognized processing services revenues from our trade matching agreement with NYMEX, which was terminated in August 2008 upon our merger with NYMEX. The decrease in revenues was partially offset by rental income and other building-related revenue generated from our building in New York City, which was acquired as part of our merger with NYMEX Holdings in August 2008. Expenses Year-over-Year Change (dollars in millions) 2010 2009 2008 2010-2009 2009-2008 Compensation and benefits $ 432.1 $ 351.0 $ 317.6 23 % 11 % Communications 40.6 47.0 52.3 (14 ) (10 ) Technology support services 50.5 46.2 59.6 9 (23 ) Professional fees and outside services 117.5 85.1 71.9 38 18 Amortization of purchased intangibles 128.1 125.1 98.7 2 27 Depreciation and amortization 129.9 126.3 137.3 3 (8 ) Occupancy and building operations 74.9 76.3 71.4 (2 ) 7 Licensing and other fee agreements 82.6 89.2 70.3 (7 ) 27 Restructuring (0.6 ) 5.3 4.8 (111 ) 11 Other 117.0 72.2 94.9 62 (24 ) Total Expenses $ 1,172.6 $ 1,023.7 $ 978.8 15 5 2010 Compared With 2009 Operating expenses increased by $148.9 million in 2010 when compared with 2009. The following table shows the estimated impact of key factors resulting in the increase in operating expenses. (dollars in millions) Year-Over-YearChange Change as aPercentage of2009 Expenses Salaries, benefits and employer taxes $ 42.7 4 % Bonus expense 32.7 3 CMA goodwill and trade name impairment 20.5 2 Marketing and travel expense 15.9 2 Professional fees related to Index Services 14.7 2 Other expenses, net 22.4 2 Total $ 148.9 15 % 53 Table of Contents The rise in salaries, benefits and employer taxes was attributable to an increase in average headcount due to Index Services as well as salary increases and rising healthcare costs. Our improved performance relative to our 2010 cash earnings target compared with 2009 relative to our 2009 cash earnings target led to the increase in our bonus expense. Impairment charges on goodwill and trade name related to our CMA operations in the second quarter of 2010 led to an increase in expenses in 2010. Global expansion and establishment of strategic partnerships contributed to an increase in marketing and travel expenses in 2010. The increase in expenses in 2010 was also due to professional fee expenses incurred for Index Services. This increase included $10.3 million of professional and legal fees incurred for the formation of Index Services. 2009 Compared With 2008 In 2009, operating expenses increased by $44.9 million when compared with 2008. The following table shows the estimated impact of key factors resulting in the increase (decrease) in operating expenses. (dollars in millions) Year-Over-YearChange Change as aPercentage of2008 Expenses Amortization of NYMEX purchased intangibles $ 30.1 3 % Salaries, benefits and employer taxes 28.1 3 Broker rebates 25.7 3 Legal fees associated with strategic initiatives 6.7 1 Marketing and travel expense (9.0 ) (1 ) Swapstream goodwill impairment (11.9 ) (1 ) Maintenance and support costs for e-CBOT (28.2 ) (3 ) Other expenses, net 3.4 — Total $ 44.9 5 % Amortization of purchased intangibles increased in 2009 due to our merger with NYMEX Holdings, which was completed in August 2008. An increase in average headcount as a result of our merger with NYMEX Holdings in 2008 contributed to the rise in salaries, benefits and employer taxes subsequent to our merger with NYMEX Holdings in August 2008. Licensing and other fee agreements increased in 2009 due to an increase in broker rebates on NYMEX products. Legal fees incurred to support various strategic initiatives, including our efforts to provide clearing services for credit default swaps and other over-the-counter products, led to growth in expenses in 2009 when compared with 2008. Marketing and travel expenses decreased in 2009 due to the company’s expense reduction efforts in 2009. Impairment charges recognized in 2008 on goodwill related to our Swapstream operations led to a decrease in this expense in 2009. A decrease in depreciation, maintenance and support for our CBOT metal products on e-CBOT, CBOT’s legacy electronic trading platform, led to a decrease in expenses in 2009. 54 Table of Contents Non-Operating Income (Expense) Year-over-Year Change (dollars in millions) 2010 2009 2008 2010-2009 2009-2008 Investment income $ 42.3 $ 28.5 $ 45.5 48 % (37 )% Impairment of long-term investments (2.2 ) (46.0 ) (274.5 ) (95 ) (83 ) Gains (losses) on derivative investments (2.6 ) — (8.1 ) n.m (100 ) Securities lending interest income — 2.8 38.3 (100 ) (93 ) Securities lending interest and other costs — (0.1 ) (51.7 ) (100 ) (100 ) Interest and other borrowing costs (140.3 ) (133.9 ) (56.5 ) 5 137 Guarantee of exercise rights privileges — 4.3 12.8 (100 ) (66 ) Equity in net losses of unconsolidated subsidiaries (6.4 ) (6.8 ) (31.5 ) (6 ) (79 ) Other income (expense) — (0.4 ) (8.5 ) (100 ) (95 ) Total Non-Operating $ (109.2 ) $ (151.6 ) $ (334.2 ) (28 ) (55 ) n.m not meaningful Investment Income. The increase in investment income in 2010 when compared with 2009 was attributable to a $16.0 million increase in dividend income from our investments in BM&FBOVESPA, TMX Group Inc. and Bolsa Mexicana de Valores, S.A.B. de C.V., and a $3.7 million gain resulting from the sale of various equity and debt securities. The increase was partially offset by a $4.8 million decrease in interest income as a result of lower average investment balances and lower average interest rates. In 2009, investment income declined when compared with 2008 due to decreases in market interest rates resulting from rate reductions by the Federal Open Market Committee throughout 2008. The decline due to interest rates was partially offset by an increase in the invested portion of clearing firms’ cash from performance bonds and guaranty fund contributions. In addition, we recognized $4.5 million in gains on our marketable securities related to our non-qualified deferred compensation plan in 2009 compared with losses of $8.2 million in 2008. Gains and losses from these securities are offset by an equal amount of compensation and benefits expense. Impairment of Long-Term Investments. In 2010, we determined that our investment in OneChicago was impaired based on its historical financial performance and other factors. As a result, we recognized an impairment charge of $2.2 million. At December 31, 2009 we determined our investment in DME was impaired due to the excess of our carrying value over our investment’s estimated fair value. As a result, we recognized an impairment charge of $23.6 million. In 2009, we also determined that our investment in IMAREX ASA (IMAREX) was impaired due to an extended and significant decline in the market price of its stock. As a result, we recognized an impairment charge of $22.4 million in 2009. In 2008, we determined that our investment in BM&FBOVESPA S.A. (BM&FBOVESPA) was impaired due to an extended and significant decline in the market price of its stock. As a result, we recognized an impairment loss of $274.5 million. Gains (Losses) on Derivative Investments. In the fourth quarter of 2010, we recognized an $8.6 million loss due to ineffectiveness on the interest rate swap contract used to hedge interest rate risk on our term loan. Both the swap contract and the term loan were originally scheduled to expire in August 2011. In December 2010, we approved a plan to refinance the term loan in January 2011 resulting in ineffectiveness of the hedge. In March 2010, we recognized a $6.0 million gain on derivative investments as a result of a settlement from the Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (Lehman) bankruptcy proceedings. The settlement related to an unsecured claim against Lehman as counterparty to an over-the-counter put option contract we purchased to hedge our risk of changes in the fair value of BM&FBOVESPA stock resulting from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and the Brazilian real. The net gain (loss) on derivative investments recognized in 2008 was due to the loss on the put option contract resulting from weakening of the U.S. dollar compared with the Brazilian real until its termination in 2008. 55 Table of Contents Securities Lending Income (Expense). During 2009 and 2010, CME’s securities lending program remained suspended as high volatility in the credit markets and extreme demand for U.S. Treasury securities continued. Suspension of the program resulted in a decrease in net securities lending interest from 2008 to 2010. We expect the securities lending program to remain suspended throughout 2011. Interest and Other Borrowing Costs. In 2010 when compared with 2009, interest expense increased due to the issuance of $612.5 million of 4.40% fixed rate notes due 2018. This resulted in an increase in average effective yield and total cost of borrowing. However, average debt balances have decreased in 2010 due to the reduction in overall debt levels throughout the year. The increase in expense was also attributable to a full year of interest expense recognized on the 5.75% fixed rate notes issued in February 2009. The increases in interest and other borrowing costs in 2009 when compared with 2008 were due to higher average debt levels outstanding, which were the result of debt issued in August 2008 in conjunction with the NYMEX Holdings merger. These borrowings consisted of commercial paper and short- and long-term notes. In February 2009, we terminated our revolving bridge facility. The increase in interest and other borrowing costs in 2009 was also attributable to the $7.6 million of debt issuance costs recognized for the bridge facility during 2009, including $4.6 million of accelerated costs resulting from the facility’s termination. Effective January 11, 2011, we terminated our $1.4 billion senior credit facility, including the $420.5 million term loan and entered into a new $1.0 billion multi-currency revolving senior credit facility, which matures in January 2014. We expect interest expense to decrease by $2.6 million in 2011 due to the refinancing of the senior credit facility. Year-over-Year Change (dollars in millions) 2010 2009 2008 2010-2009 2009-2008 Weighted average borrowings outstanding $ 2,668.1 $ 2,841.8 $ 1,296.1 $ (173.7 ) $ 1,545.7 Weighted average effective yield 4.96 % 4.23 % 3.58 % 0.73 % 0.65 % Total cost of borrowing 5.24 4.76 4.30 0.48 0.46 Total cost of borrowing includes interest, commitment fees, discount accretion and debt issuance costs. Guarantee of Exercise Rights Privileges. In December 2009, final approval of the settlement of the ERPs associated with our CBOT Holdings merger occurred and we reduced our liability associated with our guarantee of the ERPs to zero, which resulted in a gain in 2009. Following the resolution of the lawsuit, we also adjusted the value of the 159 ERPs that we held to the expected settlement value, which also contributed to the gain in 2009. We recognized a gain in 2008 due to a reassessment of possible outcomes of the litigation. Equity in Net Losses of Unconsolidated Subsidiaries. The termination of our investment in FXMS, our joint venture with Thomas Reuters Group PLC (Reuters), in the fourth quarter of 2008 contributed to the decrease in losses in 2009 when compared with 2008. In 2008, we recognized losses from our investment in FXMS of $26.5 million including a $15.9 million write off of our recorded investment in FXMS and our portion of the remaining capital needed to wind down operations. Income Tax Provision The following table summarizes the effective tax rate for the periods presented: 2010 2009 2008 Year-over-Year Change 2010-2009 2009-2008 Year ended December 31 44.7 % 42.6 % 42.7 % 2.1 % (0.1 )% 56 Table of Contents The increase in the effective tax rate in 2010 when compared with 2009 was attributable to a $51.2 million charge to record the impact of our new combined state and local tax rate on our existing deferred tax liabilities. The state and local tax rate increased due to revised state apportionment estimates resulting from annual state tax filings. The increase in the effective tax rate was also due to the impairment of CMA’s goodwill and trade name in the second quarter of 2010 which was not deductible. In 2009, the rate increased as a result of an additional valuation allowance of $64.4 million related to unrealized capital losses. The increase was offset by a decrease resulting from a $38.9 million reduction in net deferred tax liabilities related to a New York City tax law change enacted in 2009. In 2008, the rate reflected a $48.3 million charge to record the impact of our new combined state and local tax rate on our existing net deferred tax liabilities, partially offset by a first quarter 2008 Illinois tax law change that resulted in a $38.6 million reduction in net deferred tax liabilities. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash Requirements. Until we began our commercial paper program in mid-2007, we historically met our funding requirements with cash generated by our ongoing operations. While our cost structure is fixed in the short term, our sources of operating cash are dependent on trading volume levels. We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to cover our working capital needs, capital expenditures, and other commitments. However, it is possible that we may need to raise additional funds to finance our activities through issuances of commercial paper, future public debt offerings or by borrowing money from financial institutions. Cash will also be required for operating leases and non-cancelable purchase obligations as well as other obligations reflected as long-term liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2010. These were as follows: (in millions) OperatingLeases PurchaseObligations OtherLong-TermLiabilities Total(1) Year 2011 $ 22.5 $ 10.4 $ 36.8 $ 69.7 2012-2013 43.7 6.5 — 50.2 2014-2015 41.1 0.4 — 41.5 Thereafter 142.5 — — 142.5 Total $ 249.8 $ 17.3 $ 36.8 $ 303.9 (1) Gross unrecognized income tax liabilities, including interest and penalties, of $71.9 million for uncertain tax positions are not included in the table due to uncertainty about the date of their settlement. Operating leases include rent payments for office space in Chicago and other smaller offices in the United States and in various foreign countries. The operating lease for our headquarters in Chicago expires in November 2022. Annual minimum rental payments under this lease range from $8.5 million to $13.6 million. We also maintain an operating lease for additional office space in Chicago, which expires in November 2023. Annual minimum rental payments under this lease range from $3.9 million to $6.2 million. Purchase obligations include minimum payments due under agreements to purchase software licenses, hardware and maintenance as well as telecommunication services. Other long-term liabilities include primarily funding obligations for pension and other post-retirement benefit plans. Future capital expenditures for technology are anticipated as we continue to support our growth through investment in increased system capacity and performance and through technological initiatives on our electronic 57 Table of Contents trading platform. Each year capital expenditures are incurred for improvements to and expansion of our offices, remote data centers, telecommunications capabilities and other operating equipment. In 2011, we expect capital expenditures to total approximately $180 million. We continue to monitor our capital needs and may revise our forecasted expenditures as necessary in the future. We intend to continue to pay a regular quarterly dividend to our shareholders. The decision to pay a dividend, however, remains within the discretion of our board of directors and may be affected by various factors, including our earnings, financial condition, capital requirements, levels of indebtedness and other considerations our board of directors deems relevant as well as our debt instruments as discussed below. CME Group and its subsidiaries are also required to comply with restrictions contained in the general corporation laws of its state of incorporation which could also limit its (or their) ability to declare and pay dividends. In 2010, our quarterly dividend remained at $1.15 per share. On January 5, 2011, our board approved a change in our annual dividend policy to increase the target from approximately 30% of the prior year’s cash earnings to approximately 35% of the prior year’s cash earnings. On February 23, 2011, the board of directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of $1.40 per share payable on March 25, to shareholders of record on March 10. Assuming no changes in the number of shares outstanding, the first quarter dividend payment will total approximately $93.6 million. Sources and Uses of Cash. The following is a summary of cash provided by (used by) operating, investing and financing activities. Year-over-Year Change (dollars in millions) 2010 2009 2008 2010-2009 2009-2008 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,356.4 $ 1,083.1 $ 1,197.2 25 % (10 )% Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities (108.4 ) 544.8 (3,749.1 ) (120 ) 115 Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities (653.4 ) (1,665.2 ) 2,004.5 61 (183 ) Operating activities The increase in net cash provided by operating activities in 2010 when compared with 2009 was due to higher trading volumes and increased profitability. In 2010, net cash provided by operating activities was $404.3 million higher than net income. This increase was primarily the result of depreciation and amortization expense of $129.9 million and amortization of purchased intangibles of $128.1 million. An increase in accrued expenses also contributed to the overall increase. Net cash provided by operating activities decreased in 2009 when compared with 2008 due to decreased profitability excluding impairment charges. In 2009, net cash provided by operating activities was $257.3 million higher than net income. This increase was due primarily to $126.3 million of depreciation and amortization and $125.1 million of amortization of purchased intangibles. Investing activities The termination of the NYMEX securities lending program in 2009 as well as the decrease in proceeds from marketable securities, net of purchases, of $278.2 million, contributed to the increase in cash used for investing in 2010 when compared with 2009. The increase in cash in 2009 when compared with 2008 was due primarily to cash paid to shareholders in our merger with NYMEX Holdings in 2008 of $2.8 billion, net of cash received, and a payment of $612.0 million for the termination of certain NYMEX membership rights in conjunction with the merger. The increase in cash was also due to a $315.8 million net decrease in NYMEX securities lending program investments and a $382.4 million increase in proceeds from maturities of marketable securities, net of purchases in 2009. 58 Table of Contents Financing activities The decrease in cash used in 2010 relative to 2009 was attributable to a decrease in commercial paper repayments, net of proceeds, proceeds from our share issuance to BM&FBOVESPA as well as the termination of the NYMEX securities lending program in 2009. The decrease was partially offset by the distribution to Dow Jones of $607.5 million related to Index Services as well as an increase in share repurchases of $548.3 million. Share repurchases increased in an effort to offset most of the dilution associated with the issuance of shares to BM&FBOVESPA. The increase in cash used in 2009 relative to 2008 was due to new issuances of debt of $2.9 billion in 2008 in conjunction with our merger with NYMEX Holdings compared with net debt reductions of $900.1 million in 2009. Debt Instruments. The following table summarizes our debt outstanding as of December 31, 2010: (in millions) Par Value Term loan due 2011, interest equal to 3-month LIBOR plus 1.00%(1) $ 420.5 Fixed rate notes due August 2013, interest equal to 5.40% 750.0 Fixed rate notes due February 2014, interest equal to 5.75% 750.0 Fixed rate notes due March 2018, interest equal to 4.40%(2) 612.5 (1) In September 2008, the company entered into an interest rate swap agreement that modified the variable interest obligation associated with this loan so that the interest payable effectively became fixed at a rate of 4.72% beginning with the interest accrued after October 22, 2008. The interest rate swap agreement was terminated on January 11, 2011 when the loan was repaid. (2) In March 2010, we completed an unregistered offering of fixed rate notes due 2018. Net proceeds from the offering were used to fund a distribution to Dow Jones in conjunction with our investment in Index Services. In February 2010, we entered into a forward-starting interest rate swap agreement that modified the interest obligation associated with these notes so that the interest payable on the notes effectively became fixed at a rate of 4.46% beginning with the interest accrued after March 18, 2010. We maintained a $1.4 billion senior credit facility with various financial institutions, including the $420.5 million term loan and a $945.5 million revolving credit facility. The senior credit facility was terminated on January 11, 2011. Any commercial paper outstanding was backed by the revolving credit facility. Under our senior credit facility, we were required to maintain a consolidated net worth of at least $12.1 billion. Effective January 11, 2011, we entered into a new $1.0 billion multi-currency revolving senior credit facility with various financial institutions. The proceeds from the revolving senior credit facility can be used for general corporate purposes, which includes providing liquidity for our clearing house. As long as we are not in default under the new senior credit facility, we have the option to increase the facility from time to time by an aggregate amount of up to $1.8 billion with the consent of the agent and lenders providing the additional funds. The new senior credit facility matures in January 2014 and is voluntarily prepayable from time to time without premium or penalty. Under our new credit facility, we are required to remain in compliance with a consolidated net worth test, as defined as our consolidated shareholders’ equity as of September 30, 2010, giving effect to share repurchases made and special dividends paid during the term of the agreement (and in no event greater than $2.0 billion in aggregate), multiplied by 0.65. We maintain a 364-day fully secured, committed line of credit with a consortium of domestic and international banks to be used in certain situations by our clearing house. We may use the proceeds to provide temporary liquidity in the unlikely event of a clearing firm default, in the event of a liquidity constraint or default by a depositary (custodian for our collateral), or in the event of a temporary disruption with the domestic payments system that would delay payment of settlement variation between us and our clearing firms. Clearing firm guaranty fund contributions received in the form of U.S. Treasury securities, Government agency securities or 59 Table of Contents money market mutual fund as well as the performance bond assets of a defaulting firm can be used to collateralize the facility. The line of credit provides for borrowings of up to $1.0 billion. At December 31, 2010, guaranty fund collateral available was $2.2 billion. We have the option to request an increase in the line from $1.0 billion to $2.0 billion. In addition to the 364-day fully secured, committed line of credit, we also have the option to use the new $1.0 billion multi-currency revolving senior credit facility to provide liquidity for our clearing house in the unlikely event of default. In addition, our 364-day fully secured, committed revolving line of credit contains a requirement that CME remain in compliance with a consolidated tangible net worth test, defined as CME consolidated shareholder’s equity less intangible assets (as defined in the agreement), of not less than $125.0 million. In the event that CME elects to increase the facility, the minimum consolidated tangible net worth test would increase ratably up to $187.5 million. The indentures governing our floating and fixed rate notes, our 364-day fully secured, committed revolving line of credit for $1.0 billion and our $1.0 billion multi-currency revolving senior credit facility do not contain specific covenants that restrict the ability to pay dividends. These documents, however, do contain other customary financial and operating covenants that place restrictions on the operations of the company, which could indirectly affect the ability to pay dividends. At December 31, 2010, we have excess borrowing capacity for general corporate purposes of approximately $945.5 million. As of December 31, 2010, we were in compliance with the various covenant requirements of all our debt facilities. CME Group, as a holding company, has no operations of its own. Instead, it relies on dividends declared and paid to it by its subsidiaries in order to provide a portion of the funds which it uses to pay dividends to its shareholders. To satisfy our performance bond obligation with Singapore Exchange Limited, we may pledge CME-owned U.S. Treasury securities in lieu of, or in combination with, irrevocable letters of credit. At December 31, 2010, the letters of credit totaled $83.0 million. CME also guarantees a $5.0 million standby letter of credit for GFX. The beneficiary of this letter of credit is the clearing firm that is used by GFX to execute and maintain its futures position. The letter of credit would be utilized in the event that GFX defaults in meeting performance bond requirements to its clearing firm. The following table summarizes our credit ratings as of December 31, 2010: Rating Agency Short-TermDebt Rating Long-TermDebt Rating Outlook Standard & Poor’s A1+ AA Stable Moody’s Investors Service P1 Aa3 Stable Given our ability to pay down debt levels and refinance existing debt facilities if necessary, we expect to maintain an investment grade rating. If our ratings are downgraded due to a change in control which results in a downgrade below investment grade, we are required to make an offer to repurchase our fixed and floating rate notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements. As of December 31, 2010, we did not have any significant off-balance sheet arrangements as defined by the regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Liquidity and Cash Management. Cash and cash equivalents totaled $855.2 million at December 31, 2010 and $260.6 million at December 31, 2009. The balance retained in cash and cash equivalents is a function of 60 Table of Contents anticipated or possible short-term cash needs, prevailing interest rates, our investment policy and alternative investment choices. A majority of our cash and cash equivalents balance is invested in money market mutual funds that invest only in U.S. Treasury securities or U.S. government agency securities. Our exposure to risk is minimal given the nature of the investments. Our practice is to have our pension plan 100% funded at each year end on a projected benefit obligation basis, while also satisfying any minimum required contribution and obtaining the maximum tax deduction. Based on our actuarial projections, we estimate that a $14.1 million contribution in 2011 will allow us to meet our funding goal. However, the amount of the actual contribution is contingent on the actual rate of return on our plan assets during 2011 and the December 31, 2011 discount rate. Net current deferred tax assets of $18.3 million and $23.8 million are included in other current assets at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Total net current deferred tax assets include unrealized losses, stock-based compensation and accrued expenses. Net long-term deferred tax liabilities were $7.8 billion and $7.6 billion at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Net deferred tax liabilities are principally the result of purchase accounting for intangible assets in our various mergers including CBOT Holdings and NYMEX Holdings. We have a long-term deferred tax asset of $145.7 million included within our domestic long-term deferred tax liability. This deferred tax asset is for an unrealized capital loss incurred in Brazil related to our investment in BM&FBOVESPA. As of December 31, 2010, we do not believe that we currently meet the more-likely-than-not threshold that would allow us to fully realize the value of the unrealized capital loss. As a result, a partial valuation allowance of $64.4 million has been provided for the amount of the unrealized capital loss that exceeds potential capital gains that could be used to offset the capital loss in future periods. We also have a long-term deferred tax asset related to Brazilian taxes of $125.3 million for an unrealized capital loss incurred in Brazil related to our investment in BM&FBOVESPA. A full valuation allowance of $125.3 million has been provided because we do not believe that we currently meet the more-likely-than-not threshold that would allow us to realize the value of the unrealized capital loss in Brazil in the future. Valuation allowances of $49.4 million have also been provided for additional unrealized capital losses on various other investments. Net long-term deferred tax assets also include a $19.3 million deferred tax asset for foreign net operating losses related to Swapstream. Our assessment at December 31, 2010 was that we did not currently meet the more-likely-than-not threshold that would allow us to realize the value of acquired and accumulated foreign net operating losses in the future. As a result, the $19.3 million deferred tax assets arising from these net operating losses have been fully reserved. Each clearing firm is required to deposit and maintain specified performance bond collateral. Performance bond requirements are determined by parameters established by the risk management department of the clearing house and may fluctuate over time. We accept a variety of collateral to satisfy performance bond requirements. Cash performance bonds and guaranty fund contributions are included in our consolidated balance sheets. Clearing firm deposits, other than those retained in the form of cash, are not included in our consolidated balance sheets. The balances in cash performance bonds and guaranty fund contributions may fluctuate significantly over time. Cash performance bonds and guaranty fund contributions consisted of the following at December 31: (in millions) 2010 2009 Cash performance bonds $ 3,717.0 $ 5,834.6 Cash guaranty fund contributions 231.8 102.6 Cross-margin arrangements 79.7 10.6 Performance collateral for delivery 10.0 34.1 Total $ 4,038.5 $ 5,981.9 61 Table of Contents We are required under the Commodity Exchange Act to segregate cash and securities deposited by clearing firms on behalf of their customers. In addition, we are required to segregate all funds and securities deposited by clearing firms from exchange operating funds and marketable securities. As with cash performance bonds and guaranty fund contributions, these balances may fluctuate over time due to investment choices available to clearing firms and any change in total deposits required. The fair value of securities and IEF funds on deposit consisted of the following at December 31: (in millions) 2010 2009 Performance bonds $ 82,867.7 $ 70,511.5 Guaranty fund contributions 2,828.3 2,652.2 Cross-margin arrangements 196.8 220.5 Performance collateral for delivery 2.1 2.6 Total $ 85,894.9 $ 73,386.8 The performance bond collateral and the guaranty fund contributions include collateral for clearing firms for the futures, options and cleared over-the-counter credit default swaps as well as cleared over-the-counter interest rate swaps. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are subject to various market risks, including those caused by changes in interest rates, credit, foreign currency exchange rates, and equity prices. Interest Rate Risk Debt outstanding at December 31, 2010 consisted of fixed rate borrowings of $2.1 billion and variable rate borrowings of $420.5 million. Borrowings subject to interest rate fluctuations as of December 31, 2010 included the $420.5 million term loan due August 2011. The term loan bears interest at a floating rate equal to three-month LIBOR plus 1.00% per year. In September 2008, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement that modifies the variable interest obligation associated with this facility so that the interest payable effectively became fixed at a rate of 4.72% beginning with the interest accrued after October 22, 2008. On January 11, 2011, we terminated our senior credit facility, which included repayment of the $420.5 million term loan. In conjunction with the termination of our senior credit facility, we also terminated the interest rate swap agreement. Credit Risk Our clearing house acts as the counterparty to all trades consummated on our exchange as well as through third-party exchanges and over-the-counter markets for which we provide clearing services. As a result, we are exposed to significant credit risk of third parties, including our clearing firms. We are also exposed, indirectly, to the credit risk of customers of our clearing firms. These parties may default on their obligations due to bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, operational failure or other reasons. In order to ensure performance, we establish and monitor financial requirements for our clearing firms. We set minimum performance bond requirements for our exchange-traded and over-the-counter products, including credit default swaps and interest rate swaps. For futures and options on futures, we typically establish performance bond levels to cover at least 95% of expected price changes for a given product within a given historical period providing further quantitative and qualitative considerations based on market risk. For cleared over-the-counter credit default and interest rate swaps, we typically establish performance bond levels to cover at least 99% of expected price changes for a given product within a given historical period providing further quantitative and qualitative considerations based on market risk. We mark-to-market all open positions at least twice a day and require payment from clearing firms whose positions have lost value and make payments to 62 Table of Contents clearing firms whose positions have gained value. For product offerings within newer markets, positions are marked-to-market daily with the capability to mark-to-market more frequently as market conditions warrant. This allows our clearing house to identify quickly any clearing firms that may not be able to satisfy the financial obligations resulting from changes in the prices of their open contracts before those financial obligations become exceptionally large and jeopardize the ability of our clearing house to ensure performance of their open positions. This transparency makes it difficult for traders to hide losses or disguise unusual profits. Although we have policies and procedures to help ensure that our clearing firms can satisfy their obligations, these policies and procedures may not succeed in detecting problems or preventing defaults. We also have in place various measures intended to enable us to cover any default and maintain liquidity. We maintain a financial safeguard package for our clearing firms for futures, options and cleared over-the-counter credit default swap contracts. In the unlikely event of a payment default by a clearing firm for futures, options and cleared over-the-counter credit default swap contracts, we would first apply assets of the defaulting clearing firm to satisfy its payment obligation. These assets include the defaulting firm’s guaranty fund contributions, performance bonds and any other available assets, such as assets required for membership and any associated trading rights. In addition, we would make a demand for payment pursuant to any applicable guarantee provided to the exchange by the parent company of the clearing firm. Thereafter, if the payment default remains unsatisfied, we would use our surplus funds, guaranty fund contributions of other clearing firms and funds collected through an assessment against solvent clearing firms to satisfy the deficit. Surplus funds represent the amount of CME working capital reduced by an amount necessary to support normal operations and further reduced by $100.0 million that is designated by CME for our interest rate swap financial safeguard package. We also maintain an independent interest rate swaps financial safeguard package. In the unlikely event of a payment default by a clearing firm for cleared over-the-counter interest rate swap contracts, we would first apply the defaulting firm’s guaranty fund contributions and performance bonds to satisfy its payment obligation. Thereafter, if the payment default remains unsatisfied, we would use the $100.0 million of CME working capital that would be required to be contributed by CME in the event of a default in interest rate swaps, then the interest rate swap guaranty fund contributions of other interest rate swap clearing firms to satisfy the deficit. In addition, funds can be collected through an assessment against solvent clearing firms clearing interest rate swap contracts. We maintain a $1.0 billion 364-day fully secured, committed line of credit with a consortium of domestic and international banks to be used in certain situations by our clearing house. We have the option to request an increase in the line from $1.0 billion to $2.0 billion. We may use the proceeds to provide temporary liquidity in the unlikely event of a clearing firm default, in the event of a liquidity constraint or default by a depositary (custodian of the collateral), or in the event of a temporary disruption with the domestic payments system that would delay payment of settlement variation between us and our clearing firms. The credit agreement requires us to pledge clearing firm security deposits held by us in the form of U.S. Treasury or agency securities, as well as guaranty fund contributions in our IEF program to the line of credit custodian prior to drawing on the line. Performance bond collateral of a defaulting clearing firm may also be used to secure a draw on the line. In addition to the 364-day fully secured, committed line of credit, we also have the option to use the new $1.0 billion multi-currency revolving senior credit facility to provide liquidity for our clearing house in the unlikely event of default. Aggregate performance bond deposits for clearing firms for futures, options and cleared over-the-counter credit default swap contracts as well as cleared over-the-counter interest rate swap contracts was $86,584.7 million, including $3,717.0 million of cash performance bond deposits. A defaulting firm’s performance bond collateral can be used in the event of default of that clearing firm. 63 Table of Contents The following shows the available assets of our clearing house at December 31, 2010 in the event of a payment default by a clearing firm for futures, options and cleared over-the-counter credit default swap contract after first utilizing the defaulting firm’s available assets: (in millions) CME Clearing HouseAvailable Assets CME Surplus Funds(1) $ 221.7 Guaranty Fund Contributions(2) 2,208.1 Assessment Powers(3) 6,072.2 Minimum Total Assets Available for Default(4) $ 8,502.0 (1) CME surplus funds represent the amount of working capital reduced by an amount necessary to support normal operations and amounts designated by CME for our interest rate swap financial safeguards package. Our target for the CME surplus funds is $100.0 million with amounts in excess of this target generally paid as a dividend from CME to CME Group on a quarterly basis based on prior quarter-end balances. (2) Guaranty fund contributions of clearing firms include guaranty fund contributions required of clearing firms, but do not include any excess deposits held by our exchange at the direction of clearing firms. (3) In the event of a clearing firm default, if a loss continues to exist after the utilization of the assets of the defaulted firm, CME surplus funds and the non-defaulting clearing firms’ guaranty fund contributions, we have the right to assess all non-defaulting clearing members as defined in the rules governing the guaranty fund, up to 2.75 times their existing guaranty fund requirements. (4) Represents the aggregate minimum resources available to satisfy any obligations not met by a defaulting firm subsequent to the liquidation of the defaulting firm’s performance bond collateral. The following shows the available assets of our clearing house for the interest rate swap financial safeguard package at December 31, 2010 in the event of a payment default by a clearing firm that clears interest rate swap contracts, after first utilizing the defaulting firm’s available assets: (in millions) CME Clearing HouseAvailable Assets CME Designated Working Capital for Interest Rate Swap Contracts(1) $ 100.0 Guaranty Fund Contributions(2) 550.0 Minimum Total Assets Available for Default(3) $ 650.0 (1) CME designates $100.0 million of working capital to satisfy a clearing firm default in the event that the defaulting clearing firm’s guaranty contributions and performance bonds do not satisfy the deficit. (2) Guaranty fund contributions of clearing firms for interest rate swap contracts include guaranty fund contributions required of those clearing firms. (3) Represents the aggregate minimum resources available to satisfy any obligations not met by a defaulting firm subsequent to the liquidation of the defaulting firm’s performance bond collateral. In the event of a clearing firm default, if a loss continues to exist after the utilization of the assets of the defaulted firm, CME designated working capital and the non-defaulting firms’ guaranty fund contributions, we may have the right to assess all non-defaulting clearing members as defined in the rules governing the interest rate swap guaranty fund. Despite these safeguards, we cannot assure you that these measures will be sufficient to protect us from a default or that we will not be materially and adversely affected in the event of a significant default. 64 Table of Contents Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk Foreign Currency Transaction Risk Our exposure to foreign currency transaction risk resulting from our operations is considered minimal and is not expected to be material to our financial condition or operating results. Foreign Currency Translation Risk We have foreign currency translation risk related to the translation of our foreign subsidiaries’ assets and liabilities from their respective functional currencies to the U.S. dollar at each reporting date. Fluctuations in exchange rates may impact the amount of total assets and liabilities we report in our consolidated balance sheets. The financial statements of certain of our foreign subsidiaries are denominated in the British pound and the Brazilian real and are translated into U.S. dollars using a current exchange rate. Gains and losses resulting from this translation are recognized as a foreign currency translation adjustment within accumulated other comprehensive income, which is a component of shareholders’ equity. The translation adjustment, net of tax, for 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $(0.5) million, $2.6 million and $(95.7) million, respectively. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, 10% and 13% of our consolidated cash and cash equivalents balances were held by foreign subsidiaries whose balance sheets were translated from a foreign functional currency to U.S. dollars at each reporting date. Other Foreign Currency Risk We are also exposed to foreign exchange rate risk related to the equity investments noted under Equity Price Risk. Any foreign exchange rate risk related to these investments is reflected in the Equity Price Risk section below. Equity Price Risk We hold certain investments in equity securities for strategic purposes. Investments subject to equity price risks are generally recorded at their fair value. Equity securities whose sale is restricted for greater than 12 months are carried at original cost, net of impairment charges, until the restriction is within 12 months of expiration at which time they are recorded at fair value. Fair values for publicly-traded equity investments are based on quoted market prices. Fair values are subject to fluctuation and, consequently, the amount realized in the subsequent sale of an investment may differ significantly from its current reported value. Fluctuation in the market price of a security may result from perceived changes in the underlying economic characteristics of the issuer, the relative price of alternative investments and general market conditions. The table below summarizes our equity investments subject to equity price fluctuation at December 31, 2010. Equity investments are included in other assets in our consolidated balance sheets. (dollars in millions) CostBasis FairValue CarryingValue UnrealizedGain,Net of Tax BM&FBOVESPA S.A. $ 262.9 $ 798.8 $ 262.9 $ 323.9 (1) Bolsa Mexicana de Valores, S.A.B. de C.V. 17.3 24.5 24.5 4.4 IMAREX ASA 19.0 21.5 21.5 1.5 (1) In February 2008, we exchanged 1.2 million shares of CME Group Class A common stock for 101.1 million shares in BM&FBOVESPA. The company may not sell its shares in BM&FBOVESPA for four years after the purchase date. As a result, BM&FBOVESPA stock is reported in other assets at original cost less impairment loss until within 12 months of the restriction lapsing. 65 Table of Contents Beginning in February 2011, the stock will be accounted for as an available-for-sale security and any unrealized gain will be recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income. Prior to February 2011, an unrealized loss of $81.7 million, net of tax, resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) upon recognizing impairment on the investment in December 2008. The $81.7 million unrealized loss is not reflected in the table above. We do not currently hedge against equity price risk. Equity investments are assessed for other-than-temporary impairment on a quarterly basis. An assessment of whether an equity investment is other-than-temporarily impaired takes into consideration the magnitude and duration of the unrealized loss. At December 31, 2010, we determined that none of the equity investments listed above were other-than-temporarily impaired. 66 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 20:16:42.225526
