310764,SYK,STRYKER CORP,2002,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Results of Operations The table below outlines the components of the consolidated statements of earnings as a percentage of net sales and the year-to-year percentage change in dollar amounts: Percentage of Net Sales Percentage Change 2001 2000 1999 2001/00 2000/99 Net sales 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% 14% 9% Cost of sales: Before inventory step-up 37.0 35.6 37.6 18 3 Inventory step-up -- -- 9.4 -- -- Total cost of sales 37.0 35.6 47.0 18 (18) Gross profit 63.0 64.4 53.0 11 32 Research, development and engineering expenses 5.5 5.3 5.0 16 16 Selling, general and administrative expenses 37.9 38.7 38.4 11 10 Acquisition-related and restructuring charges (credits) -- -- 0.9 -- -- Other expense (income) 4.0 5.8 7.2 (21) (13) Earnings before income taxes and extraordinary item 15.6 14.6 1.4 21 -- Income taxes 5.1 5.0 0.5 18 -- Earnings before extraordinary item 10.4 9.7 0.9 23 -- Extraordinary loss, net of income taxes (0.2) -- -- -- -- Net earnings 10.3% 9.7% 0.9% 21 -- ==== === === The table below sets forth domestic/international and product line sales information: Net Sales (in millions) Percentage Change 2001 2000 1999 2001/00 2000/99 Domestic/international sales Domestic $1,688.4 $1,408.2 $1,228.4 20% 15% International 913.9 881.2 875.3 4 1 Total net sales $2,602.3 $2,289.4 $2,103.7 14 9 ====== ====== ====== Product line sales Orthopaedic Implants $1,442.5 $1,313.0 $1,248.2 10 5 MedSurg Equipment 978.9 829.1 733.5 18 13 Physical Therapy Services 180.9 147.3 122.0 23 21 Total net sales $2,602.3 $2,289.4 $2,103.7 14 9 ====== ====== ====== 2001 Compared with 2000 Stryker Corporation's net sales increased 14% in 2001 to $2,602.3 million from $2,289.4 million in 2000. Net sales grew by 12% as a result of increased unit volume and changes in product mix; 3% related to higher selling prices; 1% as a result of acquired businesses; and 1% related to the inclusion of freight revenue in net sales in 2001. Freight revenue was recorded as an offset to cost of sales during 2000. These increases were partially offset by a 3% decline due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company's domestic sales increased 20% in 2001 to $1,688.4 million from $1,408.2 million in 2000. The domestic sales gain is a result of higher shipments of Orthopaedic Implants, MedSurg Equipment and higher revenue from Physical Therapy Services. International sales increased 4% for the year to $913.9 million from $881.2 million in 2000 as a result of higher shipments of Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment. The impact of foreign currency comparisons on the dollar value of international sales was unfavorable by $62.1 million for the year. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, international sales increased 11% in 2001. Worldwide sales of Orthopaedic Implants were $1,442.5 million for 2001, representing an increase of 10% as a result of higher shipments of reconstructive (hip, knee and shoulder), trauma and spinal implants. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, sales of Orthopaedic Implants increased 13% in 2001. Worldwide sales of MedSurg Equipment were $978.9 million for 2001, representing an increase of 18% based on higher shipments of powered surgical instruments, endoscopic systems, hospital beds and stretchers and Leibinger craniomaxillofacial implants and image-guided surgical systems. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, sales of MedSurg Equipment increased 20% in 2001. Physical Therapy Services revenues were $180.9 million for 2001, representing an increase of 23% as a result of new physical therapy centers and higher revenue from existing centers. Cost of sales represented 37.0% of sales compared with 35.6% in 2000. The higher cost of sales percentage in 2001 resulted primarily from the change in recording of freight revenue described above and the classification of certain shipping costs as cost of sales in 2001 that had been reported in selling, general and administrative expenses in the prior year. The cost of sales percentage increased approximately 1.0% in 2001 as a result of the change in classification of freight revenue and shipping costs. Cost of sales for 2001 were also higher by approximately 0.4% due to an increase in unabsorbed manufacturing costs caused by the slowing of production in certain of the Company's manufacturing plants to reduce overall inventory levels. The Company continually assesses the overall capacity provided by its manufacturing plants relative to cost, inventory management and expected sales growth. A slight increase in Orthopaedic Implant margins was more than offset by higher sales and revenues of lower-margin MedSurg Equipment products and Physical Therapy Services. Research, development and engineering expenses increased 16% in 2001 and represented 5.5% of sales compared with 5.3% in 2000. The increase in research, development and engineering spending in 2001 resulted from continued Company-wide focus on new product development. New product introductions in 2001 included the Accolade Cemented Hip Stem, EIUS knee, T2 Intramedullary Nail System, Reflex Anterior Cervical Plate, Percutaneous Cement Delivery System, Elite Attachments for TPS, Cordless Driver II, Stryker Knee Navigation System, SDC Pro II surgical documentation system, 988 Digital Camera, Go Bed, Trio Mobile Surgery Platform and an enhanced Secure II bed. In the second quarter of 2001, the Company received marketing approval for its OP-1 Implant product in Australia and the European Union. The approved indication in Australia is for the treatment of nonunion of long bone fractures secondary to trauma for the purposes of initiating repair by new bone formation. The approved indication in Europe is for tibial nonunions of nine-month duration, secondary to trauma, in skeletally mature patients, in cases where previous treatment with autograft has failed or use of autograft is unfeasible. In the fourth quarter of 2001, the Company was granted Humanitarian Device Exemption (HDE) status for OP-1 Implant by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The approved indication in the U.S. is for use as an alternative to autograft in recalcitrant long bone nonunions where use of autograft is unfeasible and alternative treatments have failed. Under the HDE, OP-1 Implant will be made available as a humanitarian device, defined by the FDA as one intended to benefit patients by treating or diagnosing a disease or condition that affects fewer than 4,000 individuals per year in the U.S. The first commercial sales of OP-1 in Australia began in mid-May and the commercial launch of OP-1 in select markets of the European Union began in August. The first sales of OP-1 in the U.S. under the HDE began in November. The commercial launch of OP-1 did not have a significant impact on sales in 2001 and the Company cannot predict the impact on sales in future years. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 11% in 2001 and represented 37.9% of sales compared with 38.7% in 2000. The classification of certain shipping costs as cost of sales in 2001 reduced selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales by approximately 0.4% in 2001. In addition, discount expense related to the accounts receivable securitization program, which is included in selling, general and administrative expenses, declined to $5.8 million in 2001 from $7.1 million in 2000 as a result of lower discount rates. The Company recognized nonrecurring charges of $0.6 million in continuing operations relating to various acquisition-related and restructuring events in the fourth quarter of 2001 and recognized nonrecurring acquisition-related and restructuring credits of $1.0 million in 2000. The 2001 acquisition-related and restructuring charges include $2.4 million of charges, partially offset by the reversal of prior year restructuring accruals totaling $1.8 million. The $2.4 million in 2001 charges includes a $0.9 million acquisition-related charge for severance and related costs associated with the reorganization of the Company's sales structure in Italy to accommodate the integration of the business acquired from the Company's independent Italian distributor. The reorganization established a direct sales force in Italy that will distribute the Company's full product portfolio. The $0.9 million charge covers severance costs for three employees in Italy and costs to cancel contracts with discontinued agents. The reorganization of the sales structure in Italy is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2002. The 2001 charge also includes a $0.7 million charge related to the reorganization of the Company's distribution channels in Latin America and $0.8 million for severance costs for 10 employees in Europe. The $0.7 million charge reflects the cost to terminate a distributor and is based on contractual terms. Planned European workforce reductions are expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2002. The $1.8 million in credits includes $1.4 million related to a reduction in the expected costs to complete headcount reductions associated with the 2000 and 1999 reorganizations of the Company's European and Japanese distribution operations. The 2001 credits also include $0.4 million to reverse the remaining loss reserves established in Japan for discontinued ophthalmology inventories sold on a contingent basis in 1999. In 2000, the Company recognized nonrecurring credits of $1.0 million consisting of the reversal of prior year restructuring accruals totaling $7.0 million, partially offset by charges totaling $6.0 million. The $7.0 million in credits included $1.2 million related to the reorganization of Stryker's distribution channels associated with the acquisition of Howmedica and $2.7 million to reverse reserves for a distributor reorganization that was charged to operations in 1996. The credits also included $2.7 million related to a reduction in the expected costs to complete headcount reductions in Japan and $0.4 million to reverse a portion of loss reserves established in Japan for discontinued ophthalmology inventories sold on a contingent basis in 1999. The $6.0 million in 2000 restructuring charges included a $4.0 million charge to cover severance costs for 95 employees, primarily in Europe; and $1.4 million for asset write-offs, primarily for goodwill and inventory, and lease commitments associated with certain operations, principally in Europe, that were closed in the fourth quarter of 2000. The planned workforce reductions were completed in 2001, and the remaining amount of the reserve was reversed in 2001. The 2000 restructuring charges also included $0.6 million to terminate two small European distributors. Interest expense declined to $67.9 million in 2001 from $96.6 million in 2000, primarily as a result of lower outstanding debt balances. The increase in intangibles amortization to $38.4 million in 2001 from $34.7 million in 2000 relates primarily to business acquisitions during 2001 and the last half of 2000. Other income increased to $1.6 million in 2001 from other expense of $1.2 million in 2000, primarily as a result of foreign currency transaction gains in 2001 versus foreign currency transaction losses in 2000, partially offset by lower interest income. The effective income tax rate for 2001 was 33.0% compared with a 34.0% effective income tax rate in 2000. The decrease in the rate from 2000 to 2001 is attributable to the mix of operating results among the tax jurisdictions. Earnings before extraordinary item increased 23% to $271.8 million from $221.0 million in 2000; basic earnings per share before extraordinary item increased 22% to $1.38 in 2001 from $1.13 in 2000; and diluted earnings per share before extraordinary item increased 22% to $1.34 in 2001 from $1.10 in 2000. In December 2001, the Company refinanced and prepaid the remaining $642.7 million outstanding under the $1,650.0 million Senior Secured Credit Facilities established in 1998 in connection with the Howmedica acquisition. The prepayment of the 1998 Facilities resulted in the write-off of related unamortized deferred loan costs of $7.1 million, which has been reflected as an extraordinary loss of $4.8 million (net of income taxes of $2.3 million; $.02 per basic and diluted share). Net earnings were $267.0 million (basic and diluted net earnings per share of $1.36 and $1.32, respectively) compared with $221.0 million (basic and diluted net earnings per share of $1.13 and $1.10, respectively) in 2000. 2000 Compared with 1999 Stryker Corporation's net sales increased 9% in 2000 to $2,289.4 million from $2,103.7 million in 1999. Net sales grew by 9% as a result of increased unit volume and changes in product mix; 1% related to higher selling prices; and 1% as a result of acquired businesses. These increases were partially offset by a 2% decline due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company's domestic sales increased 15% in 2000 compared with 1999. The domestic sales gain is a result of higher shipments of Orthopaedic Implants, MedSurg Equipment and higher revenue from Physical Therapy Services. International sales increased 1% for the year as a result of higher shipments of Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment. The impact of foreign currency comparisons on the dollar value of international sales was unfavorable by $43.0 million for the year. Sales of discontinued products in 1999 were $7.7 million. Excluding the impact of foreign currency and discontinued products, international sales increased 7% in 2000. Worldwide sales of Orthopaedic Implants were $1,313.0 million for 2000, representing an increase of 5% as a result of higher shipments of reconstructive (hip, knee and shoulder), trauma and spinal implants. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, sales of Orthopaedic Implants increased 8% in 2000. Worldwide sales of MedSurg Equipment were $829.1 million for 2000, representing an increase of 13% based on higher shipments of powered surgical instruments, endoscopic systems, hospital beds and stretchers and Leibinger craniomaxillofacial implants and image-guided surgical systems. Excluding the impact of foreign currency and discontinued products, sales of MedSurg Equipment increased 14% in 2000. Physical Therapy Services revenues were $147.3 million for 2000, representing an increase of 21% as a result of new physical therapy centers and higher revenues from existing centers. Cost of sales represented 35.6% of sales compared with 47.0% in 1999. The higher cost of sales percentage in 1999 resulted from $198.2 million of additional nonrecurring cost of sales for inventory sold in 1999 that was stepped-up to fair value in connection with the acquisition of Howmedica, compared with no inventory step-up included in 2000 cost of sales. Excluding the nonrecurring cost of sales charges for inventory step-up, cost of sales would have declined from 37.6% of sales in 1999 to 35.6% in 2000. The decline is primarily the result of the realization of cost savings from cost reduction plans implemented at former Howmedica manufacturing plants and of slightly higher selling prices in 2000. Research, development and engineering expenses increased 16% in 2000 and represented 5.3% of sales compared with 5.0% in 1999. The increase in research, development and engineering spending in 2000 resulted from continued Company-wide focus on new product development. New product introductions in 2000 included Crossfire Highly Crosslinked Polyethylene for Howmedica implants, the Scorpio TS Revision Knee System, Stryker Instruments' TPS U2 drill, the Steri-Shield T4 Personal Protection System, the Stryker Navigation System, the Antigrade/Retrograde intramedullary nail, the OPUS spinal system, resorbable craniomaxillofacial plates and screws and, in certain international markets, Simplex P bone cement with Tobramycin. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 10% in 2000 and represented 38.7% of sales compared with 38.4% in 1999. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales were comparable in both years after considering the inclusion of $7.1 million in 2000 and $0.6 million in 1999 of discount expense related to the accounts receivable securitization program established in November 1999. The Company recognized nonrecurring credits of $1.0 million in continuing operations relating to various acquisition-related and restructuring events in the fourth quarter of 2000 and recognized nonrecurring acquisition-related charges of $18.9 million in 1999. The 2000 acquisition-related and restructuring credits include the reversal of prior year restructuring accruals totaling $7.0 million, partially offset by charges totaling $6.0 million. The $7.0 million in credits includes $1.2 million related to the reorganization of Stryker's distribution channels associated with the acquisition of Howmedica and $2.7 million to reverse reserves for a distributor reorganization that was charged to operations in 1996. The credits also include $2.7 million related to a reduction in the expected costs to complete headcount reductions in Japan and $0.4 million to reverse a portion of loss reserves established for discontinued ophthalmology inventories sold on a contingent basis. Both of these credits represent the reversal of charges originally taken in connection with the 1999 reorganization of the Company's Japanese distribution operation and the discontinuance of distribution of ophthalmology products in Japan. The $6.0 million in 2000 restructuring charges includes a $4.0 million charge to cover severance costs for 95 employees, primarily in Europe. Approximately 10% of the planned workforce reductions were completed in December 2000, with the remaining reductions substantially completed in 2001. The 2000 restructuring charges also include $1.4 million for asset write-offs, primarily for goodwill and inventory, and lease commitments associated with certain operations, principally in Europe, that were closed in the fourth quarter of 2000. The 2000 restructuring charges also include $0.6 million to terminate two small European distributors. In 1999, the Company recognized nonrecurring acquisition-related charges of $18.9 million, consisting of $14.2 million to reorganize Stryker's Japanese distribution operation and to discontinue the distribution of ophthalmology products in Japan and $4.7 million to complete the reorganization of Stryker's distribution channels to accommodate the Howmedica integration. Interest expense declined to $96.6 million in 2000 from $122.6 million in 1999, primarily as a result of lower outstanding debt balances. The increase in intangibles amortization to $34.7 million in 2000 from $33.9 million in 1999 relates primarily to business acquisitions during 2000. Other income declined from $4.8 million in 1999 to other expense of $1.2 million in 2000 primarily as a result of foreign currency transaction losses. The effective income tax rate for 2000 was 34.0% compared with a 34.9% effective income tax rate in 1999. The decrease in the rate from 1999 to 2000 is attributable to the mix of operating results among the tax jurisdictions. Net earnings were $221.0 million (basic and diluted net earnings per share of $1.13 and $1.10, respectively) compared with $19.4 million (basic and diluted net earnings per share of $.10) in 1999. Excluding nonrecurring items in both years, net earnings in 2000 increased 37% to $220.3 million from $160.5 million in 1999; basic net earnings per share increased 36% to $1.13 in 2000 from $.83 in 1999; and diluted net earnings per share increased 36% to $1.10 in 2000 from $.81 in 1999. Liquidity and Capital Resources The Company's working capital at December 31, 2001 increased $80.1 million to $459.7 million from $379.6 million at December 31, 2000. The working capital increase is due primarily to the reduction in current maturities of long-term debt of $134.3 million, partially offset by increases in income tax liabilities and accrued expenses. The reduction in current maturities of long-term debt is due to the establishment of a new revolving credit facility (as described in more detail below) in December 2001, which does not require principal repayments in 2002. Accounts receivable days sales outstanding, excluding the effect of the securitization program, decreased 10 days to 59 days at the end of 2001 from 69 days at December 31, 2000. The lower days sales outstanding at December 31, 2001 is the result of improved collection efforts as well as an increase in the allowance for bad debts to provide for potential exposures in Latin America and Europe. Days sales in inventory decreased to 138 days at December 31, 2001 from 166 days at December 31, 2000. The lower days sales in inventory at December 31, 2001 is primarily the result of improved inventory management. The Company generated cash of $468.3 million from operations in 2001 compared with $331.8 million in 2000. The generation of cash in 2001 is the result of strong cash earnings (net earnings plus noncash adjustments) and increases in accrued expenses, income tax liabilities and accounts payable. These increases were partially offset by increases in accounts receivable, inventories and deferred charges and payments of $11.2 million attributable to acquisition-related and restructuring charges and acquisition purchase liabilities. In 2001, the Company used cash of $161.9 million for capital expenditures, $43.0 million for business acquisitions and $15.7 million for the payment of dividends. Capital expenditures included $87.8 million to terminate a synthetic lease and purchase the Company's Mahwah, New Jersey, manufacturing and distribution facility. Business acquisitions include $27.2 million paid to Pfizer Inc., for final settlement of a working capital adjustment relating to the Howmedica purchase price. In December 2001, the Company established $1,000.0 million in Unsecured Credit Facilities. These Facilities replaced the $1,650.0 million Senior Secured Credit Facilities that were established in 1998 in conjunction with the acquisition of Howmedica. The Unsecured Credit Facilities include a $250.0 million 364-day revolving credit agreement and a $750.0 million five-year, nonamortizing, revolving credit agreement. A total of $730.5 million was drawn under the new Credit Facilities, of which $642.7 million prepaid the debt outstanding under the 1998 Facilities and $87.8 million was used to terminate the Company's synthetic lease and purchase its Mahwah, New Jersey, manufacturing and distribution facility. In addition to the refinancing, the Company borrowed $205.3 million under credit facilities to fund cash flow needs at various times during 2001 and made repayments of $568.7 million against credit facilities during 2001. Total debt declined by $289.9 million during 2001. In November 1999, the Company established a securitization facility under which certain domestic accounts receivable are sold on an ongoing basis to a special-purpose subsidiary that in turn may sell up to a $130.0 million interest in such receivables to a third party. The accounts receivable securitization facility was established to reduce the Company's overall cost of borrowing. The accounts receivable securitization facility provided $2.7 million of proceeds during 2001, with the program-to-date proceeds totaling $130.0 million as of December 31, 2001. The proceeds have been used to reduce the Company's long-term debt. The Company had $50.1 million in cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2001. The Company also had outstanding borrowings totaling $722.6 million at that date. Current maturities of long-term debt at December 31, 2001 are $1.7 million and will decrease to $0.2 million in 2003 and $0.1 million in 2004. The Company's $250.0 million 364-day revolving credit agreement expires in December 2002 and is renewable at the Company's and the lenders' discretion. The Company's $750.0 million five-year, nonamortizing, revolving credit agreement expires in December 2006. The Company believes its cash on hand as well as anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to fund future operating and capital requirements and required debt repayments. Should additional funds be required, the Company had $346.2 million of additional borrowing capacity available under all of its existing credit facilities at December 31, 2001. Other Matters The Company finalized its plan to integrate Howmedica and Stryker in 1999. As the integration plan evolved and was implemented during 1999, the Company made certain adjustments to the purchase liabilities recorded in the preliminary purchase price allocation. The additional purchase liabilities recorded in connection with the acquisition of Howmedica totaled $126.5 million. At December 31, 2001, there were $4.1 million in additional purchase liabilities remaining to be paid out. Certain obligations, such as those related to lease commitments for facility closures, will result in payments extending to 2008. The Company distributes its products throughout the world. As a result, the Company's financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets. The Company's operating results are exposed to changes in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the Japanese yen and European currencies, in particular the euro and the British pound. When the U.S. dollar strengthens against foreign currencies, the dollar value of foreign currency sales declines. When the U.S. dollar weakens, the opposite situation occurs. The Company manufactures its products in the United States, France, Germany, Ireland, Switzerland, Canada and Puerto Rico and incurs the costs to manufacture in the applicable local currencies. This worldwide deployment of factories serves to partially mitigate the impact of currency exchange rate changes on the Company's cost of sales. The Company enters into forward currency exchange contracts to mitigate the impact of currency fluctuations on transactions denominated in nonfunctional currencies, thereby limiting risk to the Company that would otherwise result from changes in exchange rates. These nonfunctional currency exposures principally relate to intercompany payables arising from intercompany purchases of manufactured products. The periods of the forward currency exchange contracts correspond to the periods of the exposed transactions, with realized gains and losses included in the measurement and recording of transactions denominated in the nonfunctional currencies. At December 31, 2001, the Company had outstanding forward currency exchange contracts to purchase $97.4 million and sell $72.1 million of various currencies (principally U.S. dollars and euros) with maturities principally ranging from 30 to 180 days. At December 31, 2000, the Company had outstanding forward currency exchange contracts to purchase $82.7 million and sell $33.8 million of various currencies (principally U.S. dollars and euros) with maturities ranging from 30 to 180 days. The estimated fair value of forward currency exchange contracts represents the measurement of the contracts at month-end spot rates as adjusted for amortized forward points. A hypothetical 10% change in exchange rates for these currencies would change the 2001 fair value by approximately $1.4 million and would have changed the 2000 fair value by approximately $1.6 million. The Company's exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to its borrowings and the accounts receivable securitization facility. The Company manages the interest rate risk on its borrowings through interest rate swap agreements, which have fixed the base rate on a $550.0 million notional amount of the $717.2 million of variable-rate borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2001. If market interest rates for similar borrowings had averaged 1% more than they did in 2001, the Company's 2001 interest expense, after considering the effects of its interest rate swaps, would have increased, and earnings before income taxes and extraordinary item would have decreased by $2.8 million. By comparison, if market interest rates had averaged 1% less than they did during 2001, the Company's 2001 interest expense, after considering the effects of its interest rate swaps, would have decreased, and earnings before income taxes and extraordinary item would have increased by $2.8 million. If market interest rates for the accounts receivable securitization facility had averaged 1% more than they did in 2001, the Company's discount expense would have increased, and earnings before income taxes and extraordinary item would have decreased by $1.3 million. By comparison, if market interest rates had averaged 1% less than they did in 2001, the Company's discount expense would have decreased, and earnings before income taxes and extraordinary item would have increased by $1.3 million. These amounts are determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on the Company's borrowing cost, interest rate swap agreements and accounts receivable securitization facility without any actions by management to mitigate its exposure to such changes. The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties on the above instruments, but does not anticipate nonperformance by any of the counterparties. As of January 1, 2001, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended by Statements No. 137 and No. 138. The Statements require the Company to recognize all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value. Derivatives that are not hedges must be adjusted to fair value through earnings. If a derivative is a hedge, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in the fair value of derivatives are either offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets, liabilities or firm commitments through earnings or recognized in accumulated other comprehensive gain (loss) until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. The Company's interest rate swap agreements effectively convert a portion of its variable-rate borrowings to a fixed-rate basis through 2003, thus reducing the impact of changes in interest rates on future interest expense. Approximately 77% of the Company's outstanding variable-rate borrowings as of December 31, 2001 have been hedged through the designation of interest rate swap agreements classified as cash flow hedges. Upon adoption of the Statements on January 1, 2001, the Company recognized a gain from the cumulative effect of an accounting change of $3.5 million in accumulated other comprehensive gain (loss) related to the interest rate swap agreements. A loss of $22.0 million attributable to a decrease in the fair value of interest rate swap agreements was recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive gain (loss) in 2001. If in the future the interest rate swap agreements were determined to be ineffective, or were terminated before the contractual termination dates, or if it became probable that the hedged variable cash flows associated with the variable-rate borrowings would stop, the Company would be required to reclassify into earnings all or a portion of the unrealized gains (losses) on cash flow hedges included in accumulated other comprehensive gain (loss). Interest rate differentials to be paid or received as a result of interest rate swaps are recognized as an adjustment of interest expense related to the designated borrowings. Based on the maturities of the Company's interest rate swap agreements, interest expense for the year ending December 31, 2002 is expected to increase by $8.2 million through the recognition of amounts included as unrealized losses on cash flow hedges at December 31, 2001. The Company uses yen-denominated floating-rate borrowings to protect a portion of the value of its investment in its subsidiary in Japan. Realized and unrealized gains and losses from this hedge are not included in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings, but are recorded as foreign currency translation adjustments within accumulated other comprehensive gain (loss) in stockholders' equity. Net gains (losses) of $5.8 million, $7.7 million and ($7.4) million attributable to the yen-denominated floating-rate borrowings hedge were recorded as foreign currency translation adjustments in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. In June 2001, the FASB issued Statement No. 141, Business Combinations and Statement No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Statement No. 141 requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001. Statement No. 142 prohibits the amortization of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and requires the Company to evaluate these intangibles for impairment on an annual basis. It is effective for business combinations completed after June 30, 2001. The Company began applying the provisions of Statement No. 142 to acquisitions completed subsequent to June 30, 2001. The goodwill recorded as a result of those acquisitions is not being amortized. For goodwill and intangible assets arising from business combinations completed before July 1, 2001, the Company is required to apply the provisions of Statement No. 142 beginning on January 1, 2002. In accordance with the Statement provisions, an assembled workforce intangible asset with an unamortized balance of $5.5 million will be reclassified from other intangibles to goodwill at that date. Application of the nonamortization provisions of the Statement in the year ending December 31, 2002 is expected to reduce intangibles amortization by approximately $16 million and increase net earnings by approximately $11 million ($.05 per diluted share). In the first quarter of 2002, the Company will perform the initial impairment tests of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets as of January 1, 2002. The Company will test for impairment using the two-step process prescribed in Statement No. 142. The first step is a screen for potential impairment. The second step, if necessary, measures the amount of the impairment. Any impairment charge resulting from these initial impairment tests will be reflected as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the first quarter of 2002. The Company has not yet determined what effect the tests will have on its consolidated results of operations or financial position. The Company will perform a subsequent impairment test in the fourth quarter of 2002 and then at least annually thereafter. As discussed in Liquidity and Capital Resources, the Company established $1,000.0 million in Unsecured Credit Facilities in December 2001. These Facilities replaced the $1,650.0 million Secured Senior Credit Facilities that were established in 1998 in conjunction with the acquisition of Howmedica. Interest expense for 2002 is expected to be reduced by approximately $9 million as a result of the refinancing. As a result of changed conditions in the insurance industry, including less favorable experience factors within the orthopaedic industry, the Company's cost for insurance coverage will increase substantially in 2002. The increase in insurance premiums will offset the $9 million in interest expense savings from the December 2001 debt refinancing. ITEM 7A.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Results of Operations The table below outlines the components of the consolidated statements of earnings as a percentage of net sales and the year-to-year percentage change in dollar amounts: Percentage of Net Sales Percentage Change 2002 2001 2000 2002/01 2001/00 Net sales 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% 16% 14% Cost of sales 36.9 37.0 35.6 15 18 Gross profit 63.1 63.0 64.4 16 11 Research, development and engineering expenses 4.7 5.5 5.3 -- 16 Selling, general and administrative expenses 38.7 37.9 38.7 18 11 Restructuring and acquisition-related charges 0.6 -- -- -- -- Other expense (income) 2.3 4.0 5.8 (33) (21) Earnings before income taxes and extraordinary item 16.8 15.6 14.6 25 21 Income taxes 5.3 5.1 5.0 20 18 Earnings before extraordinary item 11.5 10.4 9.7 27 23 Extraordinary loss, net of income taxes -- (0.2) -- -- -- Net earnings 11.5% 10.3% 9.7% 29 21 ==== ==== ==== The table below sets forth domestic/international and product line sales information: Net Sales (in millions) Percentage Change 2002 2001 2000 2002/01 2001/00 Domestic/international sales Domestic $1,973.7 $1,688.4 $1,408.2 17% 20% International 1,037.9 913.9 881.2 14 4 Total net sales $3,011.6 $2,602.3 $2,289.4 16 14 ====== ====== ====== Product line sales Orthopaedic Implants $1,704.8 $1,447.2 $1,315.6 18 10 MedSurg Equipment 1,105.3 974.2 826.5 13 18 Physical Therapy Services 201.5 180.9 147.3 11 23 Total net sales $3,011.6 $2,602.3 $2,289.4 16 14 ====== ====== ====== 2002 Compared with 2001 Stryker Corporation's net sales increased 16% in 2002 to $3,011.6 million from $2,602.3 million in 2001. Net sales grew by 11% as a result of increased unit volume and changes in product mix; 3% related to higher selling prices; and 2% as a result of acquired businesses. Domestic sales were $1,973.7 million for 2002, representing an increase of 17% as a result of strong shipments of Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment and higher revenue from Physical Therapy Services. The July 1, 2002, acquisition of the Surgical Dynamics Inc. spinal implant business (SDI) from Tyco International Ltd. added $22.8 million to domestic sales for 2002. International sales were $1,037.9 million for 2002, representing an increase of 14% as a result of higher shipments of Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment. The acquisition of SDI added $2.5 million to international sales for 2002. The impact of foreign currency comparisons to the dollar value of international sales was favorable by $13.7 million for 2002. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, international sales increased 12% in 2002. Worldwide sales of Orthopaedic Implants were $1,704.8 million for 2002, representing an increase of 18% as a result of higher shipments of reconstructive (hip, knee and shoulder), trauma and spinal implants. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, sales of Orthopaedic Implants increased 17% in 2002. Worldwide sales of MedSurg Equipment were $1,105.3 million for 2002, representing an increase of 13% as a result of higher shipments of powered surgical instruments, endoscopic systems, hospital beds and stretchers and Leibinger craniomaxillofacial implants and image-guided surgical systems. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, sales of MedSurg Equipment increased 13% in 2002. Physical Therapy Services revenues were $201.5 million for 2002, representing an increase of 11% as a result of new physical therapy centers and higher revenue from existing centers. Cost of sales represented 36.9% of sales compared with 37.0% in 2001. The slightly lower cost of sales percentage in 2002 is due to an increase in the absorption of fixed manufacturing costs caused by increased production at certain of the Company's manufacturing plants to meet current demand and higher sales growth for the higher margin Orthopaedic Implant products, offset partially by higher product obsolescence resulting from product launches. While research, development and engineering expenses in 2002 were consistent with prior year amounts, they decreased to 4.7% of sales from 5.5% in 2001. Research, development and engineering spending was affected in 2002 by the commercial launch of the osteogenic protein-1 (OP-1) product, which occurred in various markets in the second and fourth quarters of 2001. Following the launch, in 2002 Stryker Biotech recorded a greater proportion of its expenses as cost of sales and selling, general and administrative expenses, compared with 2001 when this division classified substantially all of its costs as research, development and engineering. Increased spending from the Company's continued focus on new product development partially offset the decreased research, development and engineering expenses related to Stryker Biotech. New product introductions in 2002 included ScorpioFlex knee for the United States market, Super Secur-Fit Plus hip for the Japanese market, Trident Ceramic Acetabular Hip System in Canada, Xia II Spinal System, System 5 heavy-duty, battery-powered system, TPS Saber Drill, SDC Pro 2 surgical DVD documentation system, PainPump2, Precision System for percutaneous cement delivery, fluoroscopic software module for the Stryker Navigation System and Go Bed +. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 18% in 2002 and represented 38.7% of sales compared with 37.9% in 2001. The increase in selling, general and administrative expense is partially due to an increase in sales commission expense as a result of the 16% increase in net sales in 2002. In addition, the Company incurred an $8.9 million increase in insurance costs during 2002. The change in classification of certain Stryker Biotech expenses, as discussed above, also contributed to the increase in selling, general and administrative expenses. Discount expense related to the accounts receivable securitization program, which is included in selling, general and administrative expenses, declined to $2.7 million in 2002 from $5.8 million in 2001 as a result of lower discount rates. The Company recognized charges of $17.2 million in continuing operations ($11.5 million net of income taxes) relating to restructuring and acquisition-related items in the third quarter of 2002 and restructuring and acquisition-related charges of $0.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2001. The 2002 restructuring and acquisition-related items include a charge of $21.0 million ($14.1 million net of income taxes) for employment-related costs to close the Company's Rutherford, New Jersey manufacturing facility, partially offset by a credit of $3.8 million ($2.6 million net of income taxes) to reverse certain Howmedica restructuring and acquisition-related costs to reflect actual final payments required. The $21.0 million restructuring charge relates to the shutdown agreement reached between the Company and the employee bargaining unit to close the Howmedica Osteonics implant manufacturing facility in Rutherford, New Jersey which was ratified by the members of the I.U.E.-CWA Local 485 on August 23, 2002. Under the agreement, laid-off employees will receive significantly more benefits than they would have under the Collective Bargaining Agreement that was set to expire on August 31, 2002. In addition, at least 80 qualified employees from the Rutherford facility will be offered employment at the new Howmedica Osteonics facility in Mahwah, New Jersey. The charge covers employment-related severance costs for approximately 400 employees. The Company expects the Rutherford facility to be closed over the next 12 months with final severance payments to be made in 2004. As Howmedica Osteonics prepares to permanently cease manufacturing in Rutherford, it will transition production to its facilities in Mahwah, New Jersey as well as Cork and Limerick, Ireland. In the fourth quarter of 2001, the Company recognized charges of $0.6 million in continuing operations related to various restructuring and acquisition-related events. The 2001 restructuring and acquisition-related charges included $2.4 million of charges, partially offset by the reversal of prior year restructuring accruals totaling $1.8 million. See the following comparison of 2001 results to 2000 results for additional information. Interest expense declined to $40.3 million in 2002 from $67.9 million in 2001, primarily as a result of lower outstanding debt balances. The decrease in intangibles amortization to $28.9 million in 2002 from $38.4 million in 2001 is primarily the result of the Company's adoption of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, which prohibits the amortization of goodwill. If the nonamortization provisions of Statement No. 142 had been applied in the prior year, amortization expense for 2001 would have been reduced by $18.1 million and net earnings would have increased by $12.1 million ($.06 per diluted share). Other expense was $0.5 million in 2002, compared with $1.6 million of other income in 2001 due to foreign currency transaction losses in the current year versus gains in the prior year, partially offset by higher interest income. The effective income tax rate was 31.8% in 2002 compared with 33.0% in 2001. The Company's effective income tax rate for the year was reduced from 33.0% to 31.8% in the fourth quarter of 2002, thereby reducing income tax expense by $6.1 million, primarily as a result of increased manufacturing in lower tax jurisdictions such as Ireland and Puerto Rico. Earnings before extraordinary item increased 27% to $345.6 million from $271.8 million in 2001; basic earnings per share before extraordinary item increased 27% to $1.75 in 2002 from $1.38 in 2001; and diluted earnings per share before extraordinary item increased 27% to $1.70 in 2002 from $1.34 in 2001. In December 2001, the Company refinanced and prepaid the remaining $642.7 million outstanding under the $1,650.0 million Senior Secured Credit Facilities established in 1998 in connection with the Howmedica acquisition. The prepayment of the 1998 Facilities resulted in the write-off in 2001 of related unamortized deferred loan costs of $7.1 million, which was reflected as an extraordinary loss of $4.8 million (net of income taxes of $2.3 million; $.02 per basic and diluted share). Net earnings were $345.6 million (basic and diluted net earnings per share of $1.75 and $1.70, respectively) compared with $267.0 million (basic and diluted net earnings per share of $1.36 and $1.32, respectively) in 2001. Excluding nonrecurring items that include the impact of the restructuring and acquisition-related items on 2002 and 2001 and the impact of the change in goodwill amortization and the extraordinary loss on 2001, net earnings in 2002 were $357.1 million, representing a 26% increase over net earnings of $284.3 million in 2001. Diluted net earnings per share increased 25% to $1.75 compared with $1.40 in 2001. The reconciliations, including related earnings per share amounts, of reported net earnings to adjusted net earnings before nonrecurring items are as follows: Years ended December 31 (in millions) 2002 2001 % Change Reported net earnings $345.6 $267.0 29 Restructuring and acquisition-related items 11.5 0.4 -- Goodwill and assembled workforce amortization -- 12.1 -- Extraordinary loss -- 4.8 -- Adjusted net earnings before nonrecurring items $357.1 $284.3 26 ==== ==== Basic net earnings per share: Reported basic net earnings per share $1.75 $1.36 29 Restructuring and acquisition-related items $.06 -- -- Goodwill and assembled workforce amortization -- $.06 -- Extraordinary loss -- $.02 -- Adjusted basic net earnings per share before nonrecurring items $1.81 $1.45 25 Diluted net earnings per share: Reported diluted net earnings per share $1.70 $1.32 29 Restructuring and acquisition-related items $.06 -- -- Goodwill and assembled workforce amortization -- $.06 -- Extraordinary loss -- $.02 -- Adjusted diluted net earnings per share before nonrecurring items $1.75 $1.40 25 2001 Compared with 2000 Stryker Corporation's net sales increased 14% in 2001 to $2,602.3 million from $2,289.4 million in 2000. Net sales grew by 12% as a result of increased unit volume and changes in product mix; 3% related to higher selling prices; 1% as a result of acquired businesses; and 1% related to the inclusion of freight revenue in net sales in 2001. Freight revenue was recorded as an offset to cost of sales during 2000. These increases were partially offset by a 3% decline due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company's domestic sales increased 20% in 2001 to $1,688.4 million from $1,408.2 million in 2000. The domestic sales gain was the result of higher shipments of Orthopaedic Implants, MedSurg Equipment and higher revenue from Physical Therapy Services. International sales increased 4% for the year to $913.9 million from $881.2 million in 2000 as a result of higher shipments of Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment. The impact of foreign currency comparisons on the dollar value of international sales was unfavorable by $62.1 million for the year. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, international sales increased 11% in 2001. Worldwide sales of Orthopaedic Implants were $1,447.2 million for 2001, representing an increase of 10% as a result of higher shipments of reconstructive (hip, knee and shoulder), trauma and spinal implants. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, sales of Orthopaedic Implants increased 13% in 2001. Worldwide sales of MedSurg Equipment were $974.2 million for 2001, representing an increase of 18% based on higher shipments of powered surgical instruments, endoscopic systems, hospital beds and stretchers and Leibinger craniomaxillofacial implants and image-guided surgical systems. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, sales of MedSurg Equipment increased 20% in 2001. Physical Therapy Services revenues were $180.9 million for 2001, representing an increase of 23% as a result of new physical therapy centers and higher revenue from existing centers. Cost of sales represented 37.0% of sales compared with 35.6% in 2000. The higher cost of sales percentage in 2001 resulted primarily from the change in recording of freight revenue described above and the classification of certain shipping costs as cost of sales in 2001 that had been reported in selling, general and administrative expenses in the prior year. The cost of sales percentage increased approximately 1.0% in 2001 as a result of the change in classification of freight revenue and shipping costs. Cost of sales for 2001 was also higher by approximately 0.4% due to an increase in unabsorbed manufacturing costs caused by the slowing of production in certain of the Company's manufacturing plants to reduce overall inventory levels. The Company continually assesses the overall capacity provided by its manufacturing plants relative to cost, inventory management and expected sales growth. A slight increase in Orthopaedic Implant margins was more than offset by higher sales and revenues of lower-margin MedSurg Equipment products and Physical Therapy Services. Research, development and engineering expenses increased 16% in 2001 and represented 5.5% of sales compared with 5.3% in 2000. The increase in research, development and engineering spending in 2001 resulted from continued Company-wide focus on new product development. New product introductions in 2001 included the Accolade Cemented Hip Stem, EIUS knee, T2 Intramedullary Nail System, Reflex Anterior Cervical Plate, Percutaneous Cement Delivery System, Elite Attachments for TPS, Cordless Driver II, Stryker Knee Navigation System, SDC Pro 2 surgical documentation system, 988 Digital Camera, Go Bed, Trio Mobile Surgery Platform and an enhanced Secure II bed. In the second quarter of 2001, the Company received marketing approval for its OP-1 product in Australia and the European Union. The approved indication in Australia was for the treatment of nonunion of long bone fractures secondary to trauma for the purposes of initiating repair by new bone formation. The approved indication in Europe was for tibial nonunions of nine-month duration, secondary to trauma, in skeletally mature patients, in cases where previous treatment with autograft has failed or use of autograft is unfeasible. In the fourth quarter of 2001, the Company was granted Humanitarian Device Exemption (HDE) status for OP-1 by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The approved indication in the United States was for use as an alternative to autograft in recalcitrant long bone nonunions where use of autograft is unfeasible and alternative treatments have failed. Under the HDE, OP-1 has been made available as a humanitarian device, defined by the FDA as one intended to benefit patients by treating or diagnosing a disease or condition that affects fewer than 4,000 individuals per year in the United States The first commercial sales of OP-1 in Australia began in mid-May 2001 and the commercial launch of OP-1 in select markets of the European Union began in August. The first sales of OP-1 in the United States under the HDE began in November. The commercial launch of OP-1 did not have a significant impact on sales in 2001. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 11% in 2001 and represented 37.9% of sales compared with 38.7% in 2000. The classification of certain shipping costs as cost of sales in 2001 reduced selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales by approximately 0.4% in 2001. In addition, discount expense related to the accounts receivable securitization program, which was included in selling, general and administrative expenses, declined to $5.8 million in 2001 from $7.1 million in 2000 as a result of lower discount rates. The Company recognized charges of $0.6 million in continuing operations relating to various restructuring and acquisition-related events in the fourth quarter of 2001 and recognized restructuring and acquisition-related credits of $1.0 million in 2000. The 2001 restructuring and acquisition-related charges include $2.4 million of charges, partially offset by the reversal of prior year restructuring accruals totaling $1.8 million. The $2.4 million in 2001 charges included a $0.9 million acquisition-related charge for severance and related costs associated with the reorganization of the Company's sales structure in Italy to accommodate the integration of the business acquired from the Company's independent Italian distributor. The reorganization established a direct sales force in Italy that distributes the Company's full product portfolio. The $0.9 million charge covered severance costs for three employees in Italy and costs to cancel contracts with discontinued agents. The reorganization of the sales structure in Italy was completed in the first quarter of 2002. The 2001 charge also included a $0.7 million charge related to the reorganization of the Company's distribution channels in Latin America and $0.8 million for severance costs for 10 employees in Europe. The $0.7 million charge reflected the cost to terminate a distributor and was based on contractual terms. Planned European workforce reductions were completed in the first quarter of 2002. The $1.8 million in credits included $1.4 million related to a reduction in the expected costs to complete headcount reductions associated with the 2000 and 1999 reorganizations of the Company's European and Japanese distribution operations. The 2001 credits also included $0.4 million to reverse the remaining loss reserves established in Japan for discontinued ophthalmology inventories sold on a contingent basis in 1999. In 2000, the Company recognized credits of $1.0 million, consisting of the reversal of prior year restructuring accruals totaling $7.0 million, partially offset by charges totaling $6.0 million. The $7.0 million in credits included $1.2 million related to the reorganization of Stryker's distribution channels associated with the acquisition of Howmedica and $2.7 million to reverse reserves for a distributor reorganization that was charged to operations in 1996. The credits also included $2.7 million related to a reduction in the expected costs to complete headcount reductions in Japan and $0.4 million to reverse a portion of loss reserves established in Japan for discontinued ophthalmology inventories sold on a contingent basis in 1999. The $6.0 million in 2000 restructuring charges included a $4.0 million charge to cover severance costs for 95 employees, primarily in Europe; $1.4 million for asset write-offs, primarily for goodwill and inventory, and lease commitments associated with certain operations, principally in Europe, that were closed in the fourth quarter of 2000. The planned workforce reductions were completed in 2001, and the remaining amount of the reserve was reversed in 2001. The 2000 restructuring charges also included $0.6 million to terminate two small European distributors. Interest expense declined to $67.9 million in 2001 from $96.6 million in 2000, primarily as a result of lower outstanding debt balances. The increase in intangibles amortization to $38.4 million in 2001 from $34.7 million in 2000 related primarily to business acquisitions during 2001 and the second half of 2000. Other income increased to $1.6 million in 2001 from other expense of $1.2 million in 2000, primarily as a result of foreign currency transaction gains in 2001 versus foreign currency transaction losses in 2000, partially offset by lower interest income. The effective income tax rate for 2001 was 33.0% compared with a 34.0% effective income tax rate in 2000. The decrease in the rate from 2000 to 2001 was attributable to the mix of operating results among the tax jurisdictions. Earnings before extraordinary item increased 23% to $271.8 million in 2001 from $221.0 million in 2000; basic earnings per share before extraordinary item increased 22% to $1.38 in 2001 from $1.13 in 2000; and diluted earnings per share before extraordinary item increased 22% to $1.34 in 2001 from $1.10 in 2000. In December 2001, the Company refinanced and prepaid the remaining $642.7 million outstanding under the $1,650.0 million Senior Secured Credit Facilities established in 1998 in connection with the Howmedica acquisition. The prepayment of the 1998 Facilities resulted in the write-off of related unamortized deferred loan costs of $7.1 million, which was reflected as an extraordinary loss of $4.8 million (net of income taxes of $2.3 million; $.02 per basic and diluted share). Net earnings were $267.0 million (basic and diluted net earnings per share of $1.36 and $1.32, respectively) compared with $221.0 million (basic and diluted net earnings per share of $1.13 and $1.10, respectively) in 2000. Liquidity and Capital Resources The Company's working capital at December 31, 2002 decreased $15.9 million to $443.8 million from $459.7 million at December 31, 2001. The working capital decrease is due primarily to lower cash balances, additional liabilities resulting from restructuring and acquisition-related items recorded during 2002 and increases in other accrued liabilities, partially offset by increases in accounts receivable and inventories. The additional liabilities from restructuring and acquisition-related items is the result of the aforementioned pending closure of the Company's Rutherford, New Jersey manufacturing facility. Other accrued liabilities increased in 2002 as a result of higher obligations for third-party sales agent commissions, third-party royalties, non-income based taxes and general increases in other accrued liabilities. Accounts receivable days sales outstanding, excluding the effect of the Company's $130.0 million accounts receivable securitization program, decreased 1 day to 58 days at December 31, 2002 from 59 days at December 31, 2001. The lower days sales outstanding at December 31, 2002 is the result of improved collection efforts as well as an increase in the allowance for bad debts to provide for potential exposures in Europe and Latin America. Days sales in inventory decreased 12 days to 126 days at December 31, 2002 from 138 days at December 31, 2001. The lower days sales in inventory is primarily the result of improved inventory management and higher provisions for product obsolescence as a result of product launches. The Company generated cash of $503.9 million from operations in 2002 compared with $468.3 million in 2001. The generation of cash in 2002 is the result of strong cash earnings (net earnings plus noncash adjustments) and increases in accrued expenses and income tax liabilities and decreases in the accounts receivable and inventory days mentioned previously. These items were partially offset by increases in deferred charges and accounts receivable from increased sales and payments of $8.4 million attributable to restructuring and acquisition-related liabilities and acquisition purchase liabilities. In 2002, the Company used cash of $173.6 million for business and product line acquisitions, $139.0 million for capital expenditures and $19.7 million for the payment of dividends. Business and product line acquisitions include $135.0 million paid to Tyco International Ltd. in the third quarter to acquire SDI, $14.0 million paid to Curis, Inc. to eliminate all royalties payable on future sales of OP-1 and $10.0 million paid to Pain Concepts, Inc. to acquire the DEKOMPRESSOR product line (as further discussed in Other Matters). In addition to the borrowings used to fund business and product line acquisitions, the Company borrowed an additional $438.0 million under its existing credit facilities to fund cash flow needs during 2002 and made repayments of $836.6 million against the credit facilities. Total borrowings declined by $220.9 million after adjusting for the effect of foreign currency translation. In 2002, the Company used cash of $139.0 million for capital expenditures, including $17.9 million related to the construction of Phase II of the Company's Mahwah, New Jersey manufacturing and distribution facility. In addition, the Company spent $14.3 million for the expansion of the Company's Cork, Ireland manufacturing facility and $8.8 million for improvements to the Company's newly leased Endoscopy manufacturing facility in San Jose, California. The Company had $37.8 million in cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2002. The Company also had outstanding borrowings totaling $501.7 million at that date. Current maturities of long-term debt at December 31, 2002 are $10.7 million and will decrease to $0.2 million in 2004 and $0.2 million in 2005. The Company's $250.0 million 364-day revolving credit agreement expires in December 2003 and is renewable at the Company's and the lenders' discretion. The Company's $750.0 million five-year, nonamortizing, revolving credit agreement expires in December 2006. The Company believes its cash on hand as well as anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to fund future operating and capital requirements and required debt repayments. Should additional funds be required, the Company had $589.8 million of additional borrowing capacity available under all of its existing credit facilities at December 31, 2002. The Company's future contractual obligations for agreements with initial terms greater than one year are summarized as follows: Payment Period 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 Thereafter Long-term debt $10.7 $0.2 $0.2 $487.1 $0.2 $3.3 Operating leases 40.0 31.5 22.7 16.8 13.4 45.3 The Company's additional borrowing capacity, along with the expected expiration period of the commitments, are summarized as follows: Amount of Commitment Total Expiration Per Period Amount Less than In excess of Committed 1 year 1 year Lines of credit $581.6 $326.1 $255.5 Standby letters of credit 8.2 -- 8.2 Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. On an on-going basis, management evaluates these estimates. Estimates are based on historical experience, when available, and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Management believes that an understanding of the following critical accounting policies is important in obtaining an overall understanding of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Inventory Reserves: The Company maintains reserves for excess and obsolete inventory resulting from the potential inability to sell its products at prices in excess of current carrying costs. The markets in which the Company operates are highly competitive, with new products and surgical procedures introduced on an on-going basis. Such marketplace changes may cause the Company's products to become obsolete. The Company makes estimates regarding the future recoverability of the costs of these products and records a provision for excess and obsolete inventories based on historical experience, expiration of sterilization dates and expected future trends. If actual product life cycles, product demand or acceptance of new product introductions are less favorable than projected by management, additional inventory write-downs may be required, which could unfavorably affect future operating results. Income Taxes: The Company operates in multiple tax jurisdictions both inside and outside the United States. Accordingly, management must determine the appropriate allocation of income in accordance with local law for each of these jurisdictions. Tax audits associated with the allocation of this income and other complex issues that may arise require an extended period of time to resolve and may result in income tax adjustments if changes to the income allocation are required between jurisdictions with different tax rates. The Company believes its income tax accruals are adequate to cover exposures related to such potential changes in income allocation between tax jurisdictions. To the extent additional information becomes available, such accruals are adjusted to reflect revised probable outcomes. Impairment of Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangibles: The Company follows the provisions of FASB Statement No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in determining the amount, if any, by which the Company's goodwill may be impaired in value. The Company uses the two-step process prescribed in Statement No. 142. The first step is a screen for potential impairment. The second step, if necessary, measures the amount of the impairment. Inherent in the two-step process are certain assumptions and estimates necessary to determine fair values for reportable units, as defined in Statement No. 142. Should actual results or changes in future expectations differ from those projected by management, goodwill impairment charges may be required which could unfavorably affect future operating results. See Other Matters for further discussion regarding the adoption of Statement No. 142. Other Matters The Company distributes its products throughout the world. As a result, the Company's financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets. The Company's operating results are primarily exposed to changes in exchange rates among the United States dollar and the Japanese yen and European currencies, particularly the euro and the British pound. When the United States dollar strengthens against foreign currencies, the dollar value of foreign currency sales declines. When the United States dollar weakens, the opposite situation occurs. The Company manufactures its products in the United States, France, Germany, Ireland, Switzerland, Canada and Puerto Rico and incurs the costs to manufacture in the applicable local currencies. This worldwide deployment of factories serves to partially mitigate the impact of currency exchange rate changes on the Company's cost of sales. The Company has certain investments in net assets in international locations that are not hedged that are subject to translation gains and losses due to changes in foreign currencies. For the year ended December 31, 2002, the strengthening of foreign currencies increased the value of these investments in net assets by $79.4 million. This gain reduced the previously recorded cumulative loss from weakening of foreign currencies that is deferred and recorded as a separate component of stockholders' equity. As of January 1, 2001, the Company adopted FASB Statement No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended by Statements No. 137 and No. 138. The Statements require the Company to recognize all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value. Derivatives that are not hedges must be adjusted to fair value through earnings. If a derivative is a hedge, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in the fair value of derivatives are either offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets, liabilities or firm commitments through earnings or recognized in accumulated other comprehensive gain (loss) until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. The Company enters into forward currency exchange contracts to mitigate the impact of currency fluctuations on transactions denominated in nonfunctional currencies, thereby limiting risk to the Company that would otherwise result from changes in exchange rates. These nonfunctional currency exposures principally relate to intercompany payables arising from intercompany purchases of manufactured products. The periods of the forward currency exchange contracts correspond to the periods of the exposed transactions, with realized gains and losses included in the measurement and recording of transactions denominated in the nonfunctional currencies. At December 31, 2002, the Company had outstanding forward currency exchange contracts to purchase $82.0 million and sell $97.7 million of various currencies (principally United States dollars and euros) with maturities ranging principally from 30 to 180 days. At December 31, 2001, the Company had outstanding forward currency exchange contracts to purchase $97.4 million and sell $72.1 million of various currencies (principally United States dollars and euros) with maturities ranging principally from 30 to 180 days. The estimated fair value of forward currency exchange contracts represents the measurement of the contracts at month-end spot rates as adjusted for amortized forward points. A hypothetical 10% change in exchange rates for these currencies would change the 2002 fair value by approximately $0.5 million and would have changed the 2001 fair value by approximately $1.4 million. The Company's exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to its borrowings and the accounts receivable securitization facility. The Company manages the interest rate risk on its borrowings through interest rate swap agreements, which have fixed the base rate on a $250.0 million notional amount of the $486.9 million of variable-rate borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2002. If market interest rates for similar borrowings had averaged 1% more than they did in 2002, the Company's 2002 interest expense, after considering the effects of its interest rate swaps, would have increased, and earnings before income taxes would have decreased by $1.1 million. By comparison, if market interest rates had averaged 1% less than they did during 2002, the Company's 2002 interest expense, after considering the effects of its interest rate swaps, would have decreased, and earnings before income taxes would have increased by $1.1 million. If market interest rates for the accounts receivable securitization facility had averaged 1% more than they did in 2002, the Company's discount expense would have increased, and earnings before income taxes would have decreased by $1.3 million. By comparison, if market interest rates had averaged 1% less than they did in 2002, the Company's discount expense would have decreased, and earnings before income taxes would have increased by $1.3 million. These amounts are determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on the Company's borrowing cost, interest rate swap agreements and accounts receivable securitization facility without any actions by management to mitigate its exposure to such changes. The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties on the above instruments, but does not anticipate nonperformance by any of the counterparties. The Company's interest rate swap agreements effectively convert a portion of its variable-rate borrowings to a fixed-rate basis through 2003, thus reducing the impact of changes in interest rates on future interest expense. Approximately 51% of the Company's outstanding variable-rate borrowings as of December 31, 2002 have been hedged through the designation of interest rate swap agreements classified as cash flow hedges. A gain of $9.3 million attributable to changes in the fair value of interest rate swap agreements was recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive gain (loss) in 2002. If in the future the interest rate swap agreements were determined to be ineffective or were terminated before the contractual termination dates, or if it became probable that the hedged variable cash flows associated with the variable-rate borrowings would stop, the Company would be required to reclassify into earnings all or a portion of the unrealized losses on cash flow hedges included in accumulated other comprehensive gain (loss). Interest rate differentials to be paid or received as a result of interest rate swaps are recognized as an adjustment of interest expense related to the designated borrowings. Based on the maturities of the Company's interest rate swap agreements, interest expense for the year ending December 31, 2003 is expected to be $9.2 million higher than the interest cost on the variable-rate borrowings through the recognition of amounts included as unrealized losses on cash flow hedges at December 31, 2002. The Company uses yen-denominated floating-rate borrowings to protect a portion of the value of its investment in its subsidiary in Japan. Realized and unrealized gains and losses from this hedge are not included in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings, but are recorded as foreign currency translation adjustments within accumulated other comprehensive gain (loss) in stockholders' equity. Net gains (losses) of ($1.6) million, $5.8 million and $7.7 million attributable to the yen-denominated floating-rate borrowings hedge were recorded as foreign currency translation adjustments in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. As of January 1, 2002, the Company adopted the provisions of FASB Statement No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, related to acquisitions completed before July 1, 2001. Statement No. 142 prohibits the amortization of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives and requires the Company to evaluate these intangibles for impairment on an annual basis. In accordance with the Statement's provisions, an assembled workforce intangible asset with an unamortized balance of $5.5 million as of January 1, 2002 was reclassified from other intangibles to goodwill. In the first quarter of 2002, the Company completed the initial impairment test of goodwill and, in the fourth quarter of 2002, completed the required annual impairment test of goodwill as prescribed by Statement No. 142, and determined that recorded goodwill was not impaired and no goodwill write-down was necessary. In October 2002, the Company purchased the DEKOMPRESSOR product line from Pain Concepts, Inc., at a total cost of $10.0 million giving the Company access to intellectual property and other commercial rights relating to the design and manufacture of certain medical devices. Intangible assets acquired, principally patents, are being amortized over 17 years. The Company is contingently liable for potential future milestone payments of up to $42.5 million, primarily based on future sales growth over the next five years. On October 1, 2002, the Company entered into an agreement with Curis, Inc., which eliminated all royalties payable to Curis relating to future Stryker sales of OP-1. Under terms of the agreement, the Company made a one-time cash payment of $14.0 million to Curis. The payment was allocated to existing patents and is being amortized over 15 years. On July 1, 2002, the Company acquired SDI from Tyco International Ltd., for $135.0 million in cash. The acquisition expands the Company's spinal product line by adding interbody spinal cages for the United States market as well as other thoracolumbar and cervical spinal fixation devices. The acquisition was funded using existing credit facilities. The acquisition of SDI was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. The results of operations for the acquired business are included in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements beginning July 1, 2002. The acquisition of SDI added $25.3 million to the Company's sales for the second half of 2002. SDI had sales of $55.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 and sales of $33.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2002. The purchase price of $135.0 million in cash and liabilities assumed has been preliminarily allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition. Based on the preliminary purchase price allocation, $87.1 million of the purchase price was allocated to patent licensing agreements to be amortized over their remaining life of 8 years, $12.4 million to inventory, $38.0 million to deferred tax assets related to future tax deductions, $5.1 million to other tangible assets and $7.6 million to liabilities assumed. Immediately after the acquisition was consummated, management of the Company began to implement an integration plan to combine Stryker and SDI. In conjunction with the integration plan, the Company has recorded additional purchase liabilities of $3.6 million, which were included in the preliminary purchase price allocation. The additional purchase liabilities include $3.1 million for severance and related costs and $0.5 million for contractual obligations. The severance and related costs are provided for workforce reductions covering 37 SDI employees. The workforce reductions were completed during the fourth quarter of 2002 with severance payments to be made through the third quarter of 2003. The Company's pro forma consolidated financial results did not differ significantly as a result of the SDI acquisition. In July 2002, the FASB issued Statement No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities. The Statement addresses the timing of recognition and the related measurement of the costs of one-time termination benefits such as those associated with the closing of the Rutherford facility. Under the provisions of Statement No. 146, the employment-related closing costs for Rutherford would be recognized over the 12-month closing period. Statement No. 146 is effective for exit activities initiated after December 31, 2002, with early application allowed. The Company initiated the actions related to Rutherford in June 2002 and did not adopt the provisions of Statement No. 146 when recording the costs of the Rutherford closing. Accordingly, the actual employment-related costs of the closing were expensed, upon union approval of the shutdown agreement, in the third quarter of 2002. In November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 45, Guarantor's Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others. Interpretation No. 45 changes current practice in accounting for, and disclosure of, guarantees. Interpretation No. 45 will require that certain guarantees be recorded as liabilities at fair value on the Company's balance sheet. Current practice requires that liabilities related to guarantees be recorded only when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable, as those terms are defined in FASB Statement No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies. Interpretation No. 45 also requires a guarantor to make significant new disclosures, even when the likelihood of making any payments under the guarantee is remote, which is another change from current practice. The disclosure requirements of Interpretation No. 45 are effective immediately and are included in Note 14, ""Contingencies"" to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The initial recognition and measurement provisions are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002. The Company has not yet determined what effect, if any, the new recognition and measurement provisions will have on the Company's future financial results. In December 2002, the FASB issued Statement No. 148, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation - Transition and Disclosure - an amendment of FASB Statement No. 123. Statement No. 148 amends Statement No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair-value based method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation. In addition, Statement No. 148 amends the disclosure requirements of Statement No. 123 to require disclosure in interim financial statements regarding the method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results. The Company does not intend to adopt a fair-value based method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation until a final standard is issued by the FASB that addresses concerns related to applicability of current option pricing models to non-exchange traded employee stock option plans.

310764,SYK,STRYKER CORP,2005,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Executive Level Overview Stryker Corporation (the ""Company"" or ""Stryker"") is a leader in the worldwide orthopaedic market and is one of the world's largest medical device companies. Stryker delivers results through a wide range of capabilities including joint replacements, trauma, spine and micro implant systems, orthobiologics, powered surgical instruments, surgical navigation systems and endoscopic products as well as patient handling and emergency medical equipment. Stryker also provides outpatient physical therapy services in the United States. The Company segregates its operations into two reportable business segments: Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment. The Orthopaedic Implants segment sells orthopaedic reconstructive (hip, knee and shoulder), trauma, spine and micro implant systems, bone cement and the bone growth factor osteogenic protein-1 (OP-1). The MedSurg Equipment segment sells powered surgical instruments, surgical navigation systems, endoscopic products, medical video imaging equipment and hospital beds and stretchers. The Other category includes Physical Therapy Services and corporate administration, interest expense and interest income. Domestic sales accounted for 65% of total revenues in 2004. Most of the Company's products are marketed directly to more than 6,000 hospitals and to doctors and other health-care facilities by approximately 2,350 sales and marketing personnel in the United States. Stryker primarily maintains separate and dedicated sales forces for each of its principal product lines to provide focus and a high level of expertise to each medical specialty served. International sales accounted for 35% of total revenues in 2004. The Company's products are sold in more than 100 countries through more than 1,750 local dealers and direct sales forces. Local dealer support and direct sales are coordinated by approximately 1,900 local and regional sales and marketing personnel. Stryker distributes its products through sales subsidiaries and branches with offices located in Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hong Kong, India, Italy, Japan, Korea, Mexico, The Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Singapore, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan and the United Kingdom. Stryker exports products to dealers and to customers in Africa, Bangladesh, China, the CIS (former Soviet Union), Cyprus, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Korea, Latin America, Malaysia, the Middle East, the Philippines, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, Vietnam and Yugoslavia. The Company's business is generally not seasonal in nature; however, the number of orthopaedic implant surgeries is lower during the summer months. 21 In the third quarter of 2004, the Company completed its acquisition, by merger, of all of the outstanding stock of SpineCore, Inc. (SpineCore), for an upfront payment of $120.0 million in cash plus certain transaction costs. SpineCore is a developer of artificial lumbar and cervical discs. Terms of the transaction also include milestone and royalty payments of up to an additional $240.0 million upon the achievement of commercialization of SpineCore's products in the United States, which is not expected to occur before 2008. This acquisition is expected to enhance the Company's presence in the spinal implant market, an important growth area within its Orthopaedic Implants segment. Additional details, including the financial statement impact resulting from the acquisition, are included in Results of Operations. Outlook for 2005 The Company's outlook for 2005 continues to be optimistic regarding the markets it participates in and the underlying growth rates in orthopaedic procedures. The Company expects diluted net earnings per share for 2005 to approximate $1.74, excluding the anticipated impact from the recognition of the cost of employee stock options as more fully described in Other Matters. The financial expectations for 2005 include a net sales increase of approximately 15% as a result of strong growth in shipments of Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment, favorable foreign currency exchange rate movements and higher revenue from Physical Therapy Services. If foreign currency exchange rates hold at current levels, the Company anticipates a favorable impact on net sales in the first quarter and full year of 2005 of approximately $15 million and $75 million, respectively. Excluding the effect of foreign currency exchange rates, the Company expects sales growth of approximately 13% in 2005, which is comparable to the 14% sales growth, excluding the effect of foreign currency exchange rates, reported for the full year of 2004. The Company has paid off substantially all previously outstanding borrowings under its existing credit facilities and eliminated the amounts previously outstanding under its accounts receivable securitization facility and expects to generate cash earnings (net earnings plus noncash adjustments) in excess of its needs to fund future working capital requirements. The Company anticipates investing in future business growth, including business and product line acquisitions to supplement its current product offerings, loaner instrumentation for surgical implants in support of new product launches and future building expansions, including manufacturing facility expansions for certain divisions. Results of Operations The table below outlines the components of the consolidated statements of earnings as a percentage of net sales and the year-to-year percentage change in dollar amounts: Percentage of Net Sales Percentage Change 2004 2003 2002 2004/2003 2003/2002 Net sales 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% 18% 20% Cost of sales 35.4 36.2 36.9 15 18 Gross profit 64.6 63.8 63.1 19 22 Research, development and engineering expenses 5.0 5.0 4.7 17 27 Selling, general and administrative expenses 38.8 39.1 38.7 17 22 Intangibles amortization 1.1 1.3 1.0 5 57 Purchased in-process research and development 2.8 -- -- -- -- Restructuring and acquisition-related items -- -- 0.6 -- (100) Operating income 16.9 18.5 18.2 7 23 Other expense (income) 0.1 0.5 1.4 (82) (54) Earnings before income taxes 16.8 18.0 16.8 10 29 Income taxes 5.9 5.5 5.3 26 24 Net earnings 10.9% 12.5% 11.5% 3 31 ==== ==== ==== 22 The table below sets forth domestic/international and product line sales information: Net Sales (in millions) Percentage Change 2004 2003 2002 2004/2003 2003/2002 Domestic/international sales: Domestic $2,753.0 $2,333.4 $1,973.7 18% 18% International 1,509.3 1,291.9 1,037.9 17 24 Total net sales $4,262.3 $3,625.3 $3,011.6 18 20 ====== ====== ====== Product line sales: Orthopaedic Implants $2,562.5 $2,192.5 $1,798.3 17 22 MedSurg Equipment 1,454.9 1,209.8 1,011.8 20 20 Physical Therapy Services 244.9 223.0 201.5 10 11 Total net sales $4,262.3 $3,625.3 $3,011.6 18 20 ====== ====== ====== The table below sets forth additional sales growth information for significant products within the Company's Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment product lines on both a reported basis and excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates: Percentage Change 2004/2003 2003/2002 Constant Constant Reported Currency Reported Currency Worldwide Orthopaedic Implants sales: Hips 14% 9% 20% 14% Knees 18 14 18 13 Trauma 17 11 25 15 Spine 18 15 40 35 Micro implants 16 12 11 4 Worldwide MedSurg Equipment sales: Powered surgical instruments and surgical navigation systems 17 15 21 17 Endoscopic products and medical video imaging equipment 21 20 21 19 Patient handling and emergency medical equipment 25 23 12 10 23 2004 Compared with 2003 Stryker Corporation's net sales increased 18% in 2004 to $4,262.3 million from $3,625.3 million in 2003. Net sales grew by 13% as a result of increased unit volume and changes in product mix; 3% due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates; and 2% related to higher selling prices. Domestic sales were $2,753.0 million for 2004, representing an increase of 18% as a result of strong shipments of Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment and higher revenue from Physical Therapy Services. International sales were $1,509.3 million for 2004, representing an increase of 17% as a result of higher shipments of Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment. The impact of foreign currency comparisons to the dollar value of international sales was favorable by $120.8 million for 2004. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, international sales increased 7% in 2004. Worldwide sales of Orthopaedic Implants were $2,562.5 million for 2004, representing an increase of 17% as a result of higher shipments of reconstructive, trauma, spine and micro implant systems, bone cement and the bone growth factor OP-1. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, sales of Orthopaedic Implants increased 13% for the year. Sales of hip implant systems increased 14% during the year, 9% excluding changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Sales growth for hip products slowed during 2004 primarily due to tougher comparables resulting from the launch of the Trident ceramic-on-ceramic hip system in the United States in the second quarter of 2003. Sales of knee implant systems increased 18% during the year, 14% excluding changes in foreign currency exchange rates, due to strong growth in Scorpio and Duracon knee systems in the United States. Sales of trauma implant systems increased 17% during the year, 11% excluding changes in foreign currency exchange rates, as a result of the full-scale launch of the Gamma3 Hip Fracture System in the United States, Japan and Europe in 2004. Strong growth in the Company's T2 Nailing System, both in the United States and internationally, also drove trauma sales growth in 2004. Sales of spinal implant systems increased 18% during the year, 15% excluding changes in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily due to strong sales growth of cervical and interbody products in the United States. Sales of micro implant systems increased 16% during the year, 12% excluding changes in foreign currency exchange rates, as a result of solid worldwide sales of craniomaxillofacial products. Worldwide sales of MedSurg Equipment were $1,454.9 million for 2004, representing an increase of 20% as a result of higher shipments of powered surgical instruments and surgical navigation systems, endoscopic products, and patient handling and emergency medical equipment. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, sales of MedSurg Equipment increased 18% for the year. Sales of powered surgical instruments and surgical navigation systems increased 17% during the year, 15% excluding changes in foreign currency exchange rates, due to strong sales growth in heavy-duty powered instruments, interventional pain products and surgical navigation systems both domestically and in Europe. Sales of endoscopic products increased 21% during the year, 20% excluding changes in foreign currency exchange rates, as a result of solid growth in medical video imaging equipment and sports medicine products in the United States. Sales of patient handling and emergency medical equipment increased 25% during the year, 23% excluding changes in foreign currency exchange rates, due to strong growth in hospital beds and emergency medical equipment both domestically and in the international markets. Physical Therapy Services revenues were $244.9 million for 2004, representing an increase of 10% with 6% of the growth resulting from new physical therapy centers and 4% of the increase coming from higher revenues at existing centers. Cost of sales represented 35.4% of sales in 2004 compared with 36.2% in 2003. The lower cost of sales percentage in 2004 is partially due to increased average selling prices for the Company's products and improved manufacturing efficiencies at several of the Company's manufacturing and distribution facilities, including its recently completed Mahwah, New Jersey, manufacturing and distribution facility, and lower purchase prices of raw materials, including cobalt chromium and titanium alloys. Research, development and engineering expenses represented 5.0% of sales in both 2004 and 2003. These expenses increased 17% in 2004 to $211.0 million. The higher spending level is the result of final development spending in advance of the Company's product launches in 2004 and continued focus on new product 24 development for anticipated future product launches, together with, beginning in the third quarter of 2004, spending associated with the continued development of products acquired from SpineCore. New product introductions in 2004 in the Orthopaedic Implants segment included the Restoration Modular Hip System in the United States and Europe, the Triathlon Knee System in the United States and Europe, the Scorpio NRG knee and CentPillar hip systems in the Japanese market, a worldwide launch of the OASYS posterior cervical fixation system and a full-scale launch of the Gamma3 Hip Fracture System in the United States, Japan and Europe. The Triathlon system represents the Company's evolutionary design developed to more closely reproduce natural knee motion and to provide mobility with stability through more than 150 degrees of flexion. Within the MedSurg Equipment segment, new product introductions in 2004 included a new video platform with the 1088 High Definition Camera, the first fully digital, high-definition, progressive-scan medical video camera, and the new M-Series stretcher, designed to fit the needs of acute care and specialty surgical care facilities. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 17% in 2004 and represented 38.8% of sales compared with 39.1% in 2003. The 17% increase in selling, general and administrative expenses is partially due to an increase in sales commission expense as a result of the 18% increase in net sales in 2004, increased meeting costs and higher amortization expense associated with loaner instrument sets. In addition, the Company incurred a $12.1 million increase in insurance costs during 2004 resulting from increased premiums charged by third-party insurers and its wholly owned captive insurance company established in 2003 as more fully described in Other Matters. The purchased in-process research and development charge of $120.8 million recorded in the third quarter of 2004 relates to the acquisition of SpineCore, a development stage company. At the date of the acquisition, the artificial lumbar and cervical spinal disc implant technologies acquired were in preliminary stages of clinical studies in the United States and had not yet reached technological feasibility. The upfront payment of $120.0 million, plus certain transaction costs, was allocated to assets acquired, purchased in-process research and development and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition. Interest expense declined to $6.8 million in 2004 from $22.6 million in 2003, primarily as a result of lower outstanding debt balances. The effective income tax rate was 35.0% in 2004. The reported effective income tax rate for 2004 reflects the nondeductibility for U.S. income tax purposes of the purchased in-process research and development charge recognized pursuant to the aforementioned acquisition of SpineCore. Excluding this nondeductible charge, the Company's effective income tax rate was reduced to 30.0% in 2004 compared with 30.5% in 2003 primarily as a result of increased manufacturing in lower tax jurisdictions such as Ireland and Puerto Rico. Net earnings increased 3% to $465.7 million from $453.5 million in 2003; basic net earnings per share increased 2% to $1.16 in 2004 from $1.14 in 2003; and diluted net earnings per share increased 3% to $1.14 in 2004 from $1.11 in 2003. Excluding the impact of the $120.8 million purchased in-process research and development charge recorded in the third quarter of 2004, adjusted net earnings increased 29% from $453.5 million in 2003 to $586.5 million in 2004; adjusted basic net earnings per share increased 28% from $1.14 in 2003 to $1.46 in 2004; and adjusted diluted net earnings per share increased 29% from $1.11 in 2003 to $1.43 in 2004. This adjusted financial measure does not replace the presentation of the Company's reported financial results stated under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The Company has provided this supplemental non-GAAP financial measure because it provides meaningful information regarding the Company's results on a consistent and comparable basis for the periods presented. Management uses this non-GAAP financial measure for reviewing the operating results of its business segments and for analyzing potential future business trends in connection with its budget process. In addition, the Company believes investors will utilize this information to evaluate period-to-period results and to better understand potential future operating results. The Company encourages investors and other users of these financial statements to review its Consolidated Financial Statements and other publicly filed reports in their entirety and to not rely solely on any single financial measure. The reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial measure is as follows (in millions): 25 2004 2003 % Change Reported net earnings $465.7 $453.5 3% Purchased in-process research and development 120.8 -- -- Adjusted net earnings $586.5 $453.5 29 ==== ==== Basic net earnings per share: Reported basic net earnings per share $1.16 $1.14 2 Purchased in-process research and development $.30 -- -- Adjusted basic net earnings per share $1.46 $1.14 28 Diluted net earnings per share: Reported diluted net earnings per share $1.14 $1.11 3 Purchased in-process research and development $.29 -- -- Adjusted diluted net earnings per share $1.43 $1.11 29 2003 Compared with 2002 Stryker Corporation's net sales increased 20% in 2003 to $3,625.3 million from $3,011.6 million in 2002. Net sales grew by 12% as a result of increased unit volume and changes in product mix; 5% due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates; 2% related to higher selling prices; and 1% as a result of acquired businesses. Domestic sales were $2,333.4 million for 2003, representing an increase of 18% as a result of strong shipments of Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment and higher revenue from Physical Therapy Services. International sales were $1,291.9 million for 2003, representing an increase of 24% as a result of higher shipments of Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment. The impact of foreign currency comparisons to the dollar value of international sales was favorable by $145.9 million for 2003. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, international sales increased 10% in 2003. Worldwide sales of Orthopaedic Implants were $2,192.5 million for 2003, representing an increase of 22% as a result of higher shipments of reconstructive, trauma, spine and micro implant systems, bone cement and the bone growth factor OP-1. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, sales of Orthopaedic Implants increased 16% for the year. Sales of hip implant systems increased 20% during the year, 14% excluding changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Sales growth for hip products was primarily driven by the launch of the Trident ceramic-on-ceramic hip system in the United States in the second quarter of 2003. Sales of knee implant systems increased 18% during the year, 13% excluding changes in foreign currency exchange rates, due to strong growth in Scorpio and Duracon knee systems in the United States and in Scorpio systems in Japan and the Pacific region. Sales of trauma implant systems increased 25% during the year, 15% excluding changes in foreign currency exchange rates, as a result of strong growth in the intramedullary nail product portfolio in the United States, led by the T2 Nailing System, and strong growth in hip fracture and external fixation products in Japan. Sales of spinal implant systems increased 40% during the year, 35% excluding changes in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily due to incremental sales of interbody cages resulting from the third quarter 2002 acquisition of Surgical Dynamics Inc. in the United States and strong domestic and international growth in thoracolumbar implant products. Worldwide sales of MedSurg Equipment were $1,209.8 million for 2003, representing an increase of 20% as a result of higher shipments of powered surgical instruments and surgical navigation systems, endoscopic products, and patient handling and emergency medical equipment. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, sales of MedSurg Equipment increased 16% for the year. Sales of powered surgical instruments and surgical navigation systems increased 21% during the year, 17% excluding changes in foreign currency exchange rates, due to strong sales growth in heavy-duty powered instruments, micro-powered tools and interventional pain products both domestically and in Europe and domestic sales growth of the DEKOMPRESSOR discectomy probe acquired in the fourth quarter of 2002. Sales of endoscopic products increased 21% during the year, 19% excluding changes in foreign currency exchange rates, as a result of strong growth in medical video imaging 26 equipment and arthroscopic products in the United States. Sales of patient handling and emergency medical equipment increased 12% during the year, 10% excluding changes in foreign currency exchange rates, due to strong domestic growth in hospital beds and emergency medical equipment. Physical Therapy Services revenues were $223.0 million for 2003, representing an increase of 11% with 8% of the growth resulting from new physical therapy centers and 3% of the increase coming from higher revenues at existing centers. Cost of sales represented 36.2% of sales compared with 36.9% in 2002. The lower cost of sales percentage in 2003 was due to the faster sales growth in the higher margin Orthopaedic Implants business and an increase in the absorption of fixed manufacturing costs caused by increased production at certain of the Company's manufacturing plants to meet current demand. Research, development and engineering expenses represented 5.0% of sales in 2003 compared with 4.7% in 2002. The higher spending level was the result of final development spending in advance of the Company's product launches in 2003 and continued focus on new product development for anticipated future product launches. New product introductions in 2003 included the Trident Ceramic Acetabular System, Simplex P with Tobramycin Bone Cement and the CORE platform of micro-powered surgical instruments in the United States market and the System 5 heavy-duty, battery-powered surgical instruments in Europe. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 22% in 2003 and represented 39.1% of sales compared with 38.7% in 2002. The 22% increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was partially due to an increase in sales commission expense as a result of the 20% increase in net sales in 2003. In addition, the Company incurred a $14.0 million increase in insurance costs during 2003 resulting from increased premiums charged by third-party insurers and a wholly owned captive insurance company established in 2003 as more fully described in Other Matters. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales in 2003 was primarily due to higher distribution costs associated with the increased sales mix of Orthopaedic Implants, increased amortization of loaner instrument sets, the increase in insurance costs and higher advertising costs associated with the Company's previously announced patient education campaign. The increase in intangibles amortization to $45.4 million in 2003 from $28.9 million in 2002 was primarily the result of the increased intangible assets recorded as a result of the July 1, 2002 acquisition of the Surgical Dynamics Inc. spinal implant business (SDI) from Tyco International Ltd. In addition, the Company recorded a $6.5 million charge related to a trademark impairment resulting from a branding initiative adopted by the Company in the fourth quarter of 2003. The branding initiative is intended to improve the Company's customers' and other stakeholders' overall awareness of Stryker's capabilities. The charge is included in intangibles amortization in the consolidated statements of earnings. The Company recognized charges of $17.2 million ($11.5 million net of income taxes) related to restructuring and acquisition-related items in the third quarter of 2002. The 2002 restructuring and acquisition-related items included a charge of $21.0 million ($14.1 million net of income taxes) for employment-related costs to close the Company's Rutherford, New Jersey, manufacturing facility, partially offset by a credit of $3.8 million ($2.6 million net of income taxes) to reverse certain Howmedica acquisition-related costs to reflect actual final payments required. Interest expense declined to $22.6 million in 2003 from $40.3 million in 2002, primarily as a result of lower outstanding debt balances. Other income was $3.8 million in 2003, compared with $0.5 million of other expense in 2002 due to foreign currency transaction gains in the current year compared to losses in the prior year and higher interest income. The effective income tax rate was 30.5% in 2003 compared with 31.8% in 2002. The Company's effective income tax rate for 2003 was reduced primarily as a result of increased manufacturing in lower tax jurisdictions such as Ireland and Puerto Rico. 27 Net earnings increased 31% to $453.5 million from $345.6 million in 2002; basic net earnings per share increased 31% to $1.14 in 2003 from $.87 in 2002; and diluted net earnings per share increased 31% to $1.11 in 2003 from $.85 in 2002. Excluding the impact of the restructuring and acquisition-related items for the year ended December 31, 2002, adjusted net earnings increased 27% from $357.1 million in 2002 to $453.5 million in 2003. Adjusted basic net earnings per share increased 27% from $.90 in 2002 to $1.14 in 2003. Adjusted diluted net earnings per share increased 26% from $.88 in 2002 to $1.11 in 2003. This adjusted financial measure does not replace the presentation of the Company's reported financial results stated under GAAP. The Company has provided this supplemental non-GAAP financial measure because it provides meaningful information regarding the Company's results on a consistent and comparable basis for the periods presented. Management uses this non-GAAP financial measure for reviewing the operating results of its business segments and for analyzing potential future business trends in connection with its budget process. In addition, the Company believes investors will utilize this information to evaluate period-to-period results and to better understand potential future operating results. The Company believes that the economic nature of the restructuring charge and the acquisition-related credit were sufficiently unique that similar items were not recorded in the prior two fiscal years, nor were they reasonably likely to recur within two years. In addition, the Company believes that the financial impact of each of these individual items was insignificant by the end of 2004. The Company encourages investors and other users of these financial statements to review its Consolidated Financial Statements and other publicly filed reports in their entirety and to not rely solely on any single financial measure. The reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial measure is as follows (in millions): 2003 2002 % Change Reported net earnings $453.5 $345.6 31% Restructuring charge -- 14.1 -- Acquisition-related credit -- (2.6) -- Adjusted net earnings $453.5 $357.1 27 ==== ==== Basic net earnings per share: Reported basic net earnings per share $1.14 $.87 31 Restructuring charge -- $.04 -- Acquisition-related credit -- ($.01) -- Adjusted basic net earnings per share $1.14 $.90 27 Diluted net earnings per share: Reported diluted net earnings per share $1.11 $.85 31 Restructuring charge -- $.03 -- Acquisition-related credit -- ($.01) -- Adjusted diluted net earnings per share $1.11 $.88 26 Liquidity and Capital Resources The Company's working capital at December 31, 2004 increased $465.9 million to $1,029.1 million from $563.2 million at December 31, 2003. The increase in working capital resulted from growth in the Company's overall business and the use of cash earnings to fully repay amounts outstanding under the Company's accounts receivable securitization program and to fund increases in accounts receivable, inventory, prepaid expenses and loaner instrumentation for surgical implants. Accounts payable and other accrued liabilities increased in 2004 as a result of the growth in the business, higher obligations for sales commissions, royalties, non-income-based taxes, increased reserves for legal claims and assessments and increases in other accrued liabilities. Accounts receivable days sales outstanding, excluding the effect of amounts outstanding ($0 at December 31, 2004 and $150.0 million at December 31, 2003) under the Company's $200.0 million accounts receivable securitization facility, was 58 days at both December 31, 2004 and 2003. Days sales in inventory increased 2 days to 122 days at December 31, 2004 from 120 days at December 31, 2003. The higher days sales in inventory is partially due to increased inventories to support 2004 and anticipated 2005 product launches. 28 The Company generated cash of $593.3 million from operations in 2004 compared with $648.5 million in 2003. The reduction in cash from operations in 2004 compared to the prior year is primarily due to the repayment of all amounts previously outstanding under the accounts receivable securitization facility representing an operating cash usage of $150.0 million in 2004 compared with an operating cash source of $20.0 million in 2003. The generation of cash of $593.3 million in 2004 is the result of cash earnings and increases in accounts payable, current income taxes payable and accrued expenses. These items were partially offset by the aforementioned repayment of amounts outstanding under the accounts receivable securitization facility and increases in loaner instrumentation and accounts receivable from increased sales. In 2004, the Company used cash of $144.7 million for acquisitions, $187.8 million for capital expenditures and $28.0 million for the payment of dividends. During 2004, the Company repaid the remaining $15.5 million of debt outstanding under the Company's Unsecured Credit Facility from the Howmedica acquisition. Total borrowings declined by $16.1 million after adjusting for the effects of foreign currency translation. In 2004, the Company used cash of $187.8 million for capital expenditures, including $36.1 million related to the expansion of the Company's manufacturing facility in West Lebanon, New Hampshire, and $20.7 million related to the construction of the Company's new manufacturing facilities in Portage, Michigan. The Company had $349.4 million in cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2004. The Company also had outstanding borrowings totaling $10.0 million at that date. Current maturities of long-term debt at December 31, 2004 are $9.3 million. The Company believes its cash on hand, as well as anticipated cash flows from operations, will be sufficient to fund future operating capital requirements, future manufacturing facility construction and other capital expenditures and future acquisitions to supplement its current product offerings. Should additional funds be required, the Company had $826.0 million of additional borrowing capacity available under all of its existing credit facilities, including the Company's $750.0 million five-year, nonamortizing, revolving credit agreement that expires in December 2006. In addition, the Company had $200.0 million of eligible accounts receivable that could be sold through its accounts receivable securitization facility at December 31, 2004. The Company's future contractual obligations for agreements with initial terms greater than one year, including agreements to purchase materials in the normal course of business, are summarized as follows (in millions): Payment Period 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 Thereafter Long-term debt $9.3 $0.0 $0.7 $0.0 $0.0 $0.0 Operating leases 51.0 44.0 37.4 29.0 19.3 49.6 Unconditional purchase obligations 230.2 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 The Company's additional borrowing capacity, along with the expected expiration period of the commitments, is summarized as follows (in millions): Amount of Commitment Total Expiration Per Period Amount Less than In excess of Committed 1 year 1 year Unsecured revolving credit agreement and other lines of credit $826.0 $99.9 $726.1 Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Management evaluates these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Estimates are based on historical experience, when available, and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the 29 circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Management believes that of its significant accounting policies (see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), an understanding of the following critical accounting policies is important in obtaining an overall understanding of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses in the collection of accounts receivable. The Company makes estimates regarding the future ability of its customers to make required payments based on historical credit experience and expected future trends. If actual customer financial conditions are less favorable than projected by management, additional accounts receivable write-offs may be necessary, which could unfavorably affect future operating results. Inventory Reserves The Company maintains reserves for excess and obsolete inventory resulting from the potential inability to sell its products at prices in excess of current carrying costs. The markets in which the Company operates are highly competitive, with new products and surgical procedures introduced on an ongoing basis. Such marketplace changes may cause some of the Company's products to become obsolete. The Company makes estimates regarding the future recoverability of the costs of these products and records a provision for excess and obsolete inventories based on historical experience, expiration of sterilization dates and expected future trends. If actual product life cycles, product demand or acceptance of new product introductions are less favorable than projected by management, additional inventory write-downs may be required, which could unfavorably affect future operating results. Income Taxes The Company operates in multiple tax jurisdictions both inside and outside the United States. Accordingly, management must determine the appropriate allocation of income to each of these jurisdictions. Tax audits associated with the allocation of this income and other complex issues may require an extended period of time to resolve and may result in income tax adjustments if changes to the income allocation are required between jurisdictions with different tax rates. Because tax adjustments in certain jurisdictions can be significant, the Company records accruals representing management's best estimate of the probable resolution of these matters. To the extent additional information becomes available, such accruals are adjusted to reflect the revised estimated probable outcome. Other Matters The Company distributes its products throughout the world. As a result, the Company's financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets. The Company's operating results are primarily exposed to changes in exchange rates among the United States dollar and the Japanese yen and European currencies, in particular the euro and the British pound. When the United States dollar weakens against foreign currencies, the dollar value of sales denominated in foreign currencies increases. When the United States dollar strengthens, the opposite situation occurs. The Company manufactures its products in the United States, France, Germany, Ireland, Switzerland, Canada and Puerto Rico and incurs the costs to manufacture in the applicable local currencies. This worldwide deployment of factories serves to partially mitigate the impact of currency exchange rate changes on the Company's cost of sales. The Company enters into forward currency exchange contracts to mitigate the impact of currency fluctuations on transactions denominated in nonfunctional currencies, thereby limiting risk to the Company that would otherwise result from changes in exchange rates. These nonfunctional currency exposures principally relate 30 to intercompany receivables and payables arising from intercompany purchases of manufactured products. The periods of the forward currency exchange contracts correspond to the periods of the exposed transactions, with realized gains and losses included in the measurement and recording of transactions denominated in the nonfunctional currencies. At December 31, 2004, the Company had outstanding forward currency exchange contracts to purchase $137.7 million and sell $173.1 million of various currencies (principally United States dollars and euros) with maturities ranging principally from 30 to 180 days. The estimated fair value of forward currency exchange contracts represents the measurement of the contracts at month-end spot rates as adjusted by current forward points. A hypothetical 10% change in exchange rates for these currencies would change the December 31, 2004 fair value by approximately $6.1 million. The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties on its outstanding forward currency exchange contracts but does not anticipate nonperformance by any of the counterparties. The Company has certain investments in net assets in international locations that are not hedged. These investments are subject to translation gains and losses due to changes in foreign currencies that are deferred and recorded as a separate component of stockholders' equity. For the year ended December 31, 2004, the strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar increased the value of these investments in net assets, and the related deferred gain in stockholders' equity, by $102.2 million to $209.9 million. The Company is partially self-insured for product liability claims. In 2003, the Company established a wholly owned captive insurance company in the United States to manage its self-insured retention limits. The captive insurance company provides insurance reserves for estimated liabilities for product claims incurred but not reported based on actuarially determined liabilities. The actuarial valuations are based on historical information along with certain assumptions about future events. In December 2003, the Company announced that its subsidiary Physiotherapy Associates, Inc., and Stryker received a subpoena from the United States Attorney's Office in Boston, Massachusetts, in connection with a Department of Justice investigation of Physiotherapy Associates' billing and coding practices. Physiotherapy Associates provides physical, occupational and speech therapy services to patients through 428 outpatient centers in the United States as of December 31, 2004 and represented 6% of Stryker's net sales for each of the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003. Revenues derived from billings to U.S. federal health-care programs approximated 14% of Physiotherapy Associates' revenues during these periods. The Company is fully cooperating with the Department of Justice regarding this matter. On October 22, 2004, the President of the United States signed the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the Act). The Act creates a temporary incentive for United States corporations to repatriate accumulated income earned in foreign jurisdictions by providing an 85% dividends-received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations. The deduction is subject to a number of limitations, and significant uncertainty remains about the way to interpret numerous provisions in the Act. Due to these factors, the Company is not yet in a position to determine whether, and to what extent, it might repatriate foreign earnings that have not yet been remitted to the United States. Based on its current analysis, the Company may repatriate up to $800.0 million, with a related income tax expense and liability of up to $56.0 million. The Company plans to finalize its assessment after Congress or the Treasury Department provides additional clarifying language on key elements of the repatriation provision. In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued a revision to Statement No. 123, Share-Based Payment. This revision supersedes Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and its related implementation guidance. This revision requires companies to recognize the cost of stock options based on the grant-date fair value pursuant to their employee stock option plans over the period during which the recipient is required to provide services in exchange for the options, typically the vesting period. Pursuant to the requirements of the Statement, the Company plans to adopt the provisions of the standard during the third quarter of 2005 using the modified-retrospective transition method provided in the Statement. Under this method, the Company will restate all prior periods presented on a consistent basis. The Company does not believe the adoption of this Statement will have a material impact on the trend of net earnings or net earnings per share. 31 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk are included in the Results of Operations and Other Matters sections of the Company's Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition on pages 21 through 27 and 29 through 30, respectively.",2023-12-30 18:42:54.194991
310764,SYK,STRYKER CORP,2006,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Executive Level Overview Stryker Corporation (the Company or Stryker) is one of the world's leading medical technology companies with the most broadly based range of products in orthopaedics and a significant presence in other medical specialties. Stryker works with respected medical professionals to help people lead more active and more satisfying lives. The Company's products include implants used in joint replacement, trauma, craniomaxillofacial and spinal surgeries; biologics; surgical, neurologic, ear, nose & throat and interventional pain equipment; endoscopic, surgical navigation, communications and digital imaging systems; as well as patient handling and emergency medical equipment. Stryker also provides outpatient physical therapy services in the United States. The Company segregates its operations into two reportable business segments: Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment. The Orthopaedic Implants segment sells orthopaedic reconstructive (hip, knee and shoulder), trauma, spinal and micro implant systems, bone cement and the bone growth factor OP-1. The MedSurg Equipment segment sells surgical equipment; surgical navigation systems; endoscopic, communications, and digital imaging systems; as well as patient handling and emergency medical equipment. The Other category includes Physical Therapy Services and corporate administration, interest expense and interest income. Domestic sales accounted for 65% of total revenues in 2005. Most of the Company's products are marketed directly to more than 6,000 hospitals and to doctors and other health-care facilities by approximately 2,800 sales and marketing personnel in the United States. Stryker primarily maintains separate and dedicated sales forces for each of its principal product lines to provide focus and a high level of expertise to each medical specialty served. International sales accounted for 35% of total revenues in 2005. The Company's products are sold in more than 100 countries through both Company-owned sales subsidiaries and branches and third-party dealers and distributors. The Company's business is generally not seasonal in nature; however, the number of orthopaedic implant surgeries is lower during the summer months. In the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company completed the repatriation of $722 million of foreign earnings under the provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act (the Act). The Act provided a temporary incentive for United States companies to repatriate accumulated income earned in foreign jurisdictions at a reduced income tax cost. Additional details, including the financial statement impact resulting from the repatriation of funds, are included in Results of Operations. In the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company acquired, by merger, all of the outstanding stock of PlasmaSol Corp. (PlasmaSol). PlasmaSol has developed a technology that should allow Stryker to provide sterilization equipment for use with certain of its MedSurg Equipment products. The cost of the transaction totaled approximately $17.5 million including an upfront cash payment plus the assumption of certain liabilities. In the first quarter of 2005, the Company acquired, by merger, eTrauma.com Corp. (eTrauma) for approximately $50.0 million in cash plus certain transaction costs. The acquisition expanded the Company's digital imaging equipment product offerings within its MedSurg Equipment segment by adding eTrauma's proprietary Picture Archive and Communications Systems (PACS) image management and viewing software. In the third quarter of 2004, the Company completed its acquisition, by merger, of all of the outstanding stock of SpineCore, Inc. (SpineCore), for an upfront payment of $120.0 million in cash plus certain transaction costs. SpineCore is a developer of artificial lumbar and cervical discs. Terms of the transaction also include milestone and royalty payments of up to an additional $240.0 million upon the achievement of commercialization of SpineCore's products in the United States, which is not expected to occur before 2008. This acquisition is 24 expected to enhance the Company's presence in the spinal implant market, an important growth area within its Orthopaedic Implants segment. Additional details, including the financial statement impacts resulting from these acquisitions, are included in Results of Operations. Outlook for 2006 The Company's outlook for 2006 continues to be optimistic regarding underlying growth rates in orthopaedic procedures and the Company's broadly based range of products in orthopaedics and other medical specialties, despite the potential for increased pricing pressure on Orthopaedic Implants products in the United States, Japan and certain other foreign markets. The Company projects diluted earnings per share of $2.02 in 2006, including the recognition of the cost of employee stock options as described in Other Matters. The projection represents a 21% increase over adjusted restated diluted net earnings per share of $1.67 in 2005 calculated as follows: Adjusted restated diluted net earnings per share for 2005: Reported diluted net earnings per share $1.64 Deduct stock option compensation expense - fair value method $(.08) Restated diluted net earnings per share $1.57 Adjustments: Purchased in-process research and development $.04 Income taxes on repatriation of foreign earnings $.07 Adjusted restated diluted net earnings per share $1.67 The purchased in-process research and development charge and the additional income taxes on the repatriation of foreign earnings are more fully described in Results of Operations. The financial forecast for 2006 includes a net sales increase in the range of 11% to 14% as a result of growth in shipments of Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment and higher revenue from Physical Therapy Services, offset by unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate movements. If foreign currency exchange rates hold near current levels, the Company anticipates an unfavorable impact on net sales of approximately 2% to 3% in the first quarter of 2006 and an unfavorable impact on net sales of approximately 1% to 2% for the full year of 2006. Excluding the effect of foreign currency exchange rates, the Company expects annual net sales growth in the range of 12% to 15% in 2006, which is comparable to the 14% sales growth, excluding the effect of foreign currency exchange rates, reported for the full year of 2005. 25 Results of Operations The table below outlines the components of the consolidated statements of earnings as a percentage of net sales and the year-to-year percentage change in dollar amounts: Percentage of Net Sales Percentage Change 2005 2004 2003 2005/2004 2004/2003 Net sales 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% 14% 18% Cost of sales 35.2 35.4 36.2 13 15 Gross profit 64.8 64.6 63.8 15 19 Research, development and engineering expenses 5.7 5.0 5.0 33 17 Selling, general and administrative expenses 37.2 38.8 39.1 10 17 Intangibles amortization 1.0 1.1 1.3 2 5 Purchased in-process research and development 0.3 2.8 -- (87) -- Operating income 20.5 16.9 18.5 39 7 Other income (expense) 0.1 (0.1) (0.5) -- (82) Earnings before income taxes 20.6 16.8 18.0 40 10 Income taxes 6.7 5.9 5.5 31 26 Net earnings 13.9% 10.9% 12.5% 45 3 The table below sets forth domestic/international and product line sales information: Net Sales (in millions) Percentage Change 2005 2004 2003 2005/2004 2004/2003 Domestic/international sales: Domestic $3,165.6 $2,753.0 $2,333.4 15% 18% International 1,705.9 1,509.3 1,291.9 13 17 Total net sales $4,871.5 $4,262.3 $3,625.3 14 18 Product line sales: Orthopaedic Implants $2,855.1 $2,562.5 $2,192.5 11 17 MedSurg Equipment 1,753.8 1,454.9 1,209.8 21 20 Physical Therapy Services 262.6 244.9 223.0 7 10 Total net sales $4,871.5 $4,262.3 $3,625.3 14 18 26 The table below sets forth additional sales growth information for significant products within the Company's Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment product lines on both a reported basis and a constant currency basis, which excludes the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates: Percentage Change 2005/2004 2004/2003 Constant Constant Reported Currency Reported Currency Worldwide Orthopaedic Implants sales: Hips 4% 4% 14% 9% Knees 14 13 18 14 Trauma 15 16 17 11 Spine 17 17 18 15 Micro implants 12 12 16 12 Worldwide MedSurg Equipment sales: Surgical equipment and surgical navigation systems 16 16 17 15 Endoscopic, communications and digital imaging systems 24 24 21 20 Patient handling and emergency medical equipment 23 22 25 23 2005 Compared with 2004 Stryker Corporation's net sales increased 14% in 2005 to $4,871.5 million from $4,262.3 million in 2004. Net sales grew by 12% as a result of increased unit volume and changes in product mix, 1% related to higher selling prices and 1% due to acquisitions. Domestic sales were $3,165.6 million for 2005, representing an increase of 15% as a result of higher shipments of Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment and higher revenue from Physical Therapy Services. International sales were $1,705.9 million for 2005, representing an increase of 13% as a result of higher shipments of Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment. The impact of foreign currency comparisons to the dollar value of international sales was favorable by $11.5 million for 2005. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, international sales increased 12% in 2005. Worldwide sales of Orthopaedic Implants were $2,855.1 million for 2005, representing an increase of 11% as a result of higher shipments of reconstructive, trauma, spinal and micro implant systems; bone cement; and the bone growth factor OP-1. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, sales of Orthopaedic Implants increased 11% for the year. Hip Implant Systems: Sales of hip implant systems increased 4% during the year, and also 4% excluding changes in foreign currency exchange rates, due to growth in the Trident hip system in Europe and the Pacific region and in Accolade cementless hip products and Restoration Modular Hip System revision hips in the United States, partially offset by lower sales of the Trident ceramic-on-ceramic hip system and hip fracture products in the United States. Knee Implant Systems: Sales of knee implant systems increased 14% during the year, 13% excluding changes in foreign currency exchange rates, due to strong growth in the recently launched Triathlon Knee System in the United States, Europe and the Pacific region as well as the Scorpio knee system in Europe, Japan and the Pacific region. 27 Trauma Implant Systems: Sales of trauma implant systems increased 15% during the year, 16% excluding changes in foreign currency exchange rates, as a result of the full-scale launch of the Gamma3 Hip Fracture System in the United States, Japan and Europe in the second half of 2004. Strong growth in the Company's T2 Nailing System, both in the United States and internationally, also drove trauma sales growth in 2005. Spinal Implant Systems: Sales of spinal implant systems increased 17% during the year, and also 17% excluding changes in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily due to strong sales growth of interbody devices in the United States led by sales of the recently launched AVS spacer products as well as solid worldwide growth in cervical and thoraco-lumbar product sales. Micro Implant Systems: Sales of micro implant systems increased 12% during the year, and also 12% excluding changes in foreign currency exchange rates, as a result of strong worldwide sales of implant products for hand indications and solid domestic sales of products for neuro indications. Worldwide sales of MedSurg Equipment were $1,753.8 million for 2005, representing an increase of 21% as a result of higher shipments of surgical equipment; surgical navigation systems; endoscopic, communications and digital imaging systems; as well as patient handling and emergency medical equipment. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, sales of MedSurg Equipment increased 20% for the year. Surgical Equipment and Surgical Navigation Systems: Sales of surgical equipment and surgical navigation systems increased 16% during the year, and also 16% excluding changes in foreign currency exchange rates, due to strong worldwide sales growth in the System 5 heavy-duty powered systems, interventional pain products, SteriShield personal protection systems and surgical navigation products as well as strong sales growth in the Neptune operating waste management system in the United States. Endoscopic, Communications and Digital Imaging Systems: Sales of endoscopic, communications and digital imaging systems increased 24% during the year, and also 24% excluding changes in foreign currency exchange rates, as a result of strong growth in medical video imaging equipment, led by growth of digital imaging equipment and the 1088 High Definition Camera, and strong growth in general surgery products in the United States, partially offset by slower growth in arthroscopy in the United States resulting from the discontinuance of allograft products during the year. Patient Handling and Emergency Medical Equipment: Sales of patient handling and emergency medical equipment increased 23% during the year, 22% excluding changes in foreign currency exchange rates, due to strong sales growth in hospital and maternity beds and emergency medical equipment in the United States and solid growth in stretcher sales in the United States. Physical Therapy Services revenues were $262.6 million for 2005, representing an increase of 7% with all of the growth coming from new physical therapy centers. Cost of sales represented 35.2% of sales in 2005 compared with 35.4% in 2004. The lower cost of sales percentage in 2005 is partially due to increased average selling prices for the Company's products and lower excess and obsolete inventory costs associated with discontinued products partially offset by faster sales growth in the lower margin MedSurg Equipment segment and higher growth in royalty costs relative to sales growth. Research, development and engineering expenses represented 5.7% of sales in 2005 compared with 5.0% in 2004. These expenses increased 33% in 2005 to $279.8 million. The higher spending level is the result of the Company's continued focus on new product development for anticipated future product launches and continued investments in new technologies, together with, beginning in the third quarter of 2004, spending associated with the continued development of products acquired from SpineCore. New product introductions in 2005 in the Orthopaedic Implants segment included X3 Polyethylene, the Company's next-generation highly crosslinked polyethylene featuring a higher level of strength and wear reduction in both hip and knee replacements, and the posterior-stabilized version of the Triathlon Knee System in the United States, Europe, Canada and the Pacific region. Within the MedSurg Equipment segment, new product introductions in 2005 included the Maestro drill which expanded the Company's line of micro powered instruments for spine; neurology; and ear, nose and throat applications. 28 Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 10% in 2005 and represented 37.2% of sales compared with 38.8% in 2004. The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales in 2005 is due to lower meeting costs and slower growth in advertising costs and insurance premiums relative to the Company's growth in net sales. These decreases are partially offset by an increase in sales commission expense as a result of the 14% growth in net sales in 2005 in addition to higher amortization expense associated with loaner instrument sets. The purchased in-process research and development charge of $15.9 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2005 relates to the acquisition of PlasmaSol, a private, development-stage company. At the date of the acquisition, the sterilization technology acquired had not yet been approved for sale by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and, therefore, had not yet reached technological feasibility. The purchase price of $17.5 million was preliminarily allocated to assets acquired primarily for deferred tax assets associated with acquired net operating losses and purchased in-process research and development based on their fair value at the date of acquisition. The purchased in-process research and development charge of $120.8 million recorded in the third quarter of 2004 relates to the acquisition of SpineCore, a private, development-stage company. At the date of the acquisition, the artificial lumbar and cervical spinal disc implant technologies acquired were in preliminary stages of clinical studies in the United States and had not yet reached technological feasibility. The upfront payment of $120.0 million, plus certain transaction costs, was allocated to assets acquired, purchased in-process research and development and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition. Interest expense, which is included in other income (expense), increased to $7.7 million in 2005 from $6.8 million in 2004, primarily as a result of increased borrowings in Europe to complete the repatriation of foreign earnings in the fourth quarter of 2005. Interest income, which is included in other income (expense), increased to $13.3 million in 2005 from $4.7 million in 2004, primarily due to increased cash and marketable securities balances throughout the year. The effective income tax rate was 32.7% for the year ended December 31, 2005 and 35.0% for the year ended December 31, 2004. The reported effective income tax rate for 2005 reflects a charge of $27.4 million to recognize the income tax expense and related liability associated with the repatriation of $722 million of foreign earnings under the provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act completed in the fourth quarter. The reported effective income tax rate for 2005 also reflects the nondeductibility, for income tax purposes, of the $15.9 million purchased in-process research and development charge associated with the PlasmaSol acquisition. The reported effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2004 reflects the nondeductibility, for income tax purposes, of the $120.8 million purchased in-process research and development charge associated with the SpineCore acquisition. Excluding the impact of income taxes on the repatriation of foreign earnings in 2005 and the impact of the purchased in-process research and development charges in 2005 and 2004, the Company's effective income tax rate was reduced to 29.5% in 2005 compared with 30.0% in 2004, primarily as a result of increased manufacturing in lower tax jurisdictions. Net earnings in 2005 increased 45% to $675.2 million from $465.7 million in 2004; basic net earnings per share increased 44% to $1.67 in 2005 from $1.16 in 2004; and diluted net earnings per share increased 44% to $1.64 in 2005 from $1.14 in 2004. Excluding the impacts of the charges to write off purchased in-process research and development in 2005 and 2004 and to recognize income tax expense associated with the repatriation of foreign earnings in 2005, adjusted net earnings increased 23% to $718.5 million in 2005 from $586.5 million in 2004. Adjusted basic net earnings per share increased 22% to $1.78 in 2005 from $1.46 in 2004, and adjusted diluted net earnings per share increased 22% to $1.75 in 2005 from $1.43 in 2004. This adjusted financial measure does not replace the presentation of the Company's reported financial results stated under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The Company has provided this supplemental non-GAAP financial measure because it provides meaningful information regarding the Company's results on a consistent and comparable basis for the periods presented. Management uses this non-GAAP financial measure for reviewing the operating results of its business segments and for analyzing potential future business trends in connection with its budget process. In addition, the Company believes investors will utilize this information to evaluate period-to-period results and to better understand potential future operating results. The 29 Company encourages investors and other users of these financial statements to review its Consolidated Financial Statements and other publicly filed reports in their entirety and not to rely solely on any single financial measure. The reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial measure is as follows (in millions): 2005 2004 % Change Reported net earnings $675.2 $465.7 45% Purchased in-process research and development 15.9 120.8 (87) Income taxes on repatriation of foreign earnings 27.4 -- -- Adjusted net earnings $718.5 $586.5 23 Basic net earnings per share: Reported basic net earnings per share $1.67 $1.16 44 Purchased in-process research and development $.04 $.30 (87) Income taxes on repatriation of foreign earnings $.07 -- -- Adjusted basic net earnings per share $1.78 $1.46 22 Diluted net earnings per share: Reported diluted net earnings per share $1.64 $1.14 44 Purchased in-process research and development $.04 $.29 (86) Income taxes on repatriation of foreign earnings $.07 -- -- Adjusted diluted net earnings per share $1.75 $1.43 22 2004 Compared with 2003 Stryker Corporation's net sales increased 18% in 2004 to $4,262.3 million from $3,625.3 million in 2003. Net sales grew by 13% as a result of increased unit volume and changes in product mix, 3% due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and 2% related to higher selling prices. Domestic sales were $2,753.0 million for 2004, representing an increase of 18% as a result of higher shipments of Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment and higher revenue from Physical Therapy Services. International sales were $1,509.3 million for 2004, representing an increase of 17% as a result of higher shipments of Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment. The impact of foreign currency comparisons to the dollar value of international sales was favorable by $120.8 million for 2004. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, international sales increased 7% in 2004. Worldwide sales of Orthopaedic Implants were $2,562.5 million for 2004, representing an increase of 17% as a result of higher shipments of reconstructive, trauma, spinal and micro implant systems; bone cement; and the bone growth factor OP-1. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, sales of Orthopaedic Implants increased 13% for the year. Hip Implant Systems: Sales of hip implant systems increased 14% during the year, 9% excluding changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Sales growth for hip products slowed during 2004 primarily due to tougher comparables resulting from the launch of the Trident ceramic-on-ceramic hip system in the United States in the second quarter of 2003. Knee Implant Systems: Sales of knee implant systems increased 18% during the year, 14% excluding changes in foreign currency exchange rates, due to strong growth in Scorpio and Duracon knee systems in the United States. Trauma Implant Systems: Sales of trauma implant systems increased 17% during the year, 11% excluding changes in foreign currency exchange rates, as a result of the full-scale launch of the Gamma3 Hip Fracture System in the United States, Japan and Europe in 2004. Strong growth in the Company's T2 Nailing System, both in the United States and internationally, also drove trauma sales growth in 2004. 30 Spinal Implant Systems: Sales of spinal implant systems increased 18% during the year, 15% excluding changes in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily due to strong sales growth of cervical and interbody products in the United States. Micro Implant Systems: Sales of micro implant systems increased 16% during the year, 12% excluding changes in foreign currency exchange rates, as a result of strong sales of implant products for hand indications and solid domestic sales of implant products for neuro indications. Worldwide sales of MedSurg Equipment were $1,454.9 million for 2004, representing an increase of 20% as a result of higher shipments of surgical equipment; surgical navigation systems; endoscopic, communications and digital imaging systems; as well as patient handling and emergency medical equipment. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, sales of MedSurg Equipment increased 18% for the year. Surgical Equipment and Surgical Navigation Systems: Sales of surgical equipment and surgical navigation systems increased 17% during the year, 15% excluding changes in foreign currency exchange rates, due to strong sales growth in heavy-duty powered instruments, interventional pain products and surgical navigation systems both domestically and in Europe. Endoscopic, Communications and Digital Imaging Systems: Sales of endoscopic, communications and digital imaging systems increased 21% during the year, 20% excluding changes in foreign currency exchange rates, as a result of solid growth in digital imaging equipment and sports medicine products in the United States. Patient Handling and Emergency Medical Equipment: Sales of patient handling and emergency medical equipment increased 25% during the year, 23% excluding changes in foreign currency exchange rates, due to strong growth in hospital beds and emergency medical equipment both domestically and in the international markets. Physical Therapy Services revenues were $244.9 million for 2004, representing an increase of 10%, with 6% of the growth resulting from new physical therapy centers and 4% of the increase coming from higher revenues at existing centers. Cost of sales represented 35.4% of sales in 2004 compared with 36.2% in 2003. The lower cost of sales percentage in 2004 is partially due to increased average selling prices for the Company's products and improved manufacturing efficiencies at several of the Company's manufacturing and distribution facilities, including its Mahwah, New Jersey, manufacturing and distribution facility, and lower purchase prices of raw materials, including cobalt chromium and titanium alloys. Research, development and engineering expenses represented 5.0% of sales in both 2004 and 2003. These expenses increased 17% in 2004 to $211.0 million. The higher spending level is the result of final development spending in advance of the Company's product launches in 2004 and continued focus on new product development for anticipated future product launches, together with, beginning in the third quarter of 2004, spending associated with the continued development of products acquired from SpineCore. New product introductions in 2004 in the Orthopaedic Implants segment included the Restoration Modular Hip System in the United States and Europe; the Triathlon Knee System in the United States and Europe; the Scorpio NRG knee and CentPillar hip systems in Japan; a worldwide launch of the OASYS posterior cervical fixation system; and a full-scale launch of the Gamma3 Hip Fracture System in the United States, Japan and Europe. The Triathlon Knee System represents the Company's evolutionary design developed to more closely reproduce natural knee motion and to provide mobility with stability through more than 150 degrees of flexion. Within the MedSurg Equipment segment, new product introductions in 2004 included a new video platform with the 1088 High Definition Camera, the first fully digital, high-definition, progressive-scan medical video camera, and the new M-Series stretcher, designed to fit the needs of acute care and specialty surgical care facilities. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 17% in 2004 and represented 38.8% of sales compared with 39.1% in 2003. The 17% increase in selling, general and administrative expenses is partially due to an increase in sales commission expense as a result of the 18% increase in net sales in 2004, increased meeting costs and higher amortization expense associated with loaner instrument sets. In addition, the Company incurred 31 a $12.1 million increase in insurance costs during 2004 resulting from increased premiums charged by third-party insurers and its wholly owned captive insurance company established in 2003 as more fully described in Other Matters. The purchased in-process research and development charge of $120.8 million recorded in the third quarter of 2004 relates to the acquisition of SpineCore. Interest expense, which is included in other income (expense), declined to $6.8 million in 2004 from $22.6 million in 2003, primarily as a result of lower outstanding debt balances. The effective income tax rate was 35.0% in 2004. The reported effective income tax rate for 2004 reflects the nondeductibility, for income tax purposes, of the purchased in-process research and development charge associated with the SpineCore acquisition. Excluding the effect of this nondeductible charge, the Company's effective income tax rate was reduced to 30.0% in 2004 compared with 30.5% in 2003, primarily as a result of increased manufacturing in lower tax jurisdictions. Net earnings in 2004 increased 3% to $465.7 million from $453.5 million in 2003; basic net earnings per share increased 2% to $1.16 in 2004 from $1.14 in 2003; and diluted net earnings per share increased 3% to $1.14 in 2004 from $1.11 in 2003. Excluding the impact of the $120.8 million purchased in-process research and development charge recorded in 2004, adjusted net earnings increased 29% to $586.5 million in 2004 from $453.5 million in 2003. Adjusted basic net earnings per share increased 28% to $1.46 in 2004 from $1.14 in 2003, and adjusted diluted net earnings per share increased 29% to $1.43 in 2004 from $1.11 in 2003. The reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial measure, as previously described, is as follows (in millions): 2004 2003 % Change Reported net earnings $465.7 $453.5 3% Purchased in-process research and development 120.8 -- -- Adjusted net earnings $586.5 $453.5 29 Basic net earnings per share: Reported basic net earnings per share $1.16 $1.14 2 Purchased in-process research and development $.30 -- -- Adjusted basic net earnings per share $1.46 $1.14 28 Diluted net earnings per share: Reported diluted net earnings per share $1.14 $1.11 3 Purchased in-process research and development $.29 -- -- Adjusted diluted net earnings per share $1.43 $1.11 29 Liquidity and Capital Resources The Company's working capital at December 31, 2005 increased $592.2 million to $1,621.3 million from $1,029.1 million at December 31, 2004. The increase in working capital resulted from growth in the Company's overall business and the use of cash earnings to fund increases in accounts receivable, inventories and prepaid expenses. Accrued liabilities increased in 2005 as a result of the growth in the business, higher obligations for acquisitions, sales commissions, royalties, dividends and increases in other accrued liabilities. Accounts receivable days sales outstanding was 54 days at December 31, 2005 compared with 58 days at December 31, 2004. Days sales in inventory decreased 8 days to 114 days at December 31, 2005 from 122 days at December 31, 2004. The decrease in days sales outstanding and days sales in inventory at December 31, 2005 is primarily due to improved asset management. 32 The Company generated cash of $863.8 million from operations in 2005 compared with $593.3 million in 2004. The increase in cash from operations in 2005 compared with the prior year is primarily due to higher net earnings in 2005 and the elimination of amounts outstanding under the accounts receivable securitization facility representing an operating cash usage of $150.0 million in 2004 along with the improvements in days sales outstanding and days sales in inventory. In 2005, the Company used cash of $271.7 million for capital expenditures, including $50.9 million for the expansion of the company's manufacturing facility in Lebanon, New Hampshire; $41.5 million related to the implementation of ERP systems at multiple manufacturing and distribution facilities; $27.3 million for the construction of the Company's new manufacturing facilities in Portage, Michigan; and $20.1 million for the Company's new manufacturing facility in Neuchâtel, Switzerland. In addition, the Company used cash of $59.7 million for acquisitions and $36.2 million for the payment of dividends; it also purchased and sold marketable securities. These securities, which are classified as available-for-sale investments in accordance with the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, totaled $565.3 million at December 31, 2005. In the first quarter of 2005, the Company acquired eTrauma for approximately $50.0 million in cash plus certain transaction costs. The acquisition of eTrauma was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. The results of operations for the acquired business are included in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements from the date of the acquisition and did not materially impact the Company's reported operating results. Pro forma consolidated results of operations would not differ significantly as a result of the eTrauma acquisition. The purchase price for eTrauma has been preliminarily allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition. Based on the preliminary purchase price allocation, $22.0 million was allocated to identifiable intangibles, to be amortized over their remaining lives of 5 to 8 years, and $31.6 million was allocated to goodwill. Immediately after the acquisition was consummated, management of the Company began to implement an integration plan to combine Stryker and eTrauma. In conjunction with the integration plan, the Company recorded additional purchase liabilities for severance and related costs of $0.3 million, which were included in the purchase price allocation. The Company had $491.2 million in cash and cash equivalents and $565.3 million in marketable securities at December 31, 2005. The Company also had outstanding borrowings totaling $231.6 million at that date. Current maturities of long-term debt at December 31, 2005 were $47.4 million. The Company believes its cash on hand and marketable securities, as well as anticipated cash flows from operations, will be sufficient to fund future operating capital requirements; future manufacturing facility construction and other capital expenditures; future business and product line acquisitions to supplement its current product offerings; loaner instrumentation for surgical implants in support of new product launches; and required debt repayments. In November 2005, the Company established a $1,000.0 million Unsecured Credit Facility, which replaced the previously outstanding $750.0 million Unsecured Credit Facility. The new facility, which expires in November 2010, includes a senior term loan with an original principal amount of €190.0 million and a senior 5-year nonamortizing, revolving credit agreement with a maximum amount of $1,000.0 million, less any outstanding amount of the senior term loan. A total of €190.0 million was drawn under the senior term loan to facilitate the repatriation of foreign earnings and remains outstanding at December 31, 2005. Should additional funds be required, the Company had $842.1 million of additional borrowing capacity available under all of its existing credit facilities, including the Company's $1,000.0 million Unsecured Credit Facility. In addition, the Company had $200.0 million of eligible accounts receivable that could be sold through its accounts receivable securitization facility at December 31, 2005. 33 The Company's future contractual obligations for agreements with initial terms greater than 1 year, including agreements to purchase materials in the normal course of business, are summarized as follows (in millions): Payment Period 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Thereafter Long-term debt $47.4 $48.2 $47.3 $47.3 $41.4 $0.0 Operating leases 51.2 42.9 35.4 26.0 17.1 48.4 Unconditional purchase obligations 165.7 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 The Company's additional borrowing capacity, along with the expected expiration period of the commitments, is summarized as follows (in millions): Amount of Commitment Total Expiration Per Period Amount Less than In excess of Committed 1 year 1 year Unsecured revolving credit agreement and other lines of credit $842.1 $112.8 $729.3 Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Management evaluates these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Estimates are based on historical experience, when available, and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Management believes that of its significant accounting policies (see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), an understanding of the following critical accounting policies is important in obtaining an overall understanding of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses in the collection of accounts receivable. The Company makes estimates regarding the future ability of its customers to make required payments based on historical credit experience and expected future trends. If actual customer financial conditions are less favorable than projected by management, additional accounts receivable write-offs may be necessary, which could unfavorably affect future operating results. Inventory Reserves The Company maintains reserves for excess and obsolete inventory resulting from the potential inability to sell its products at prices in excess of current carrying costs. The markets in which the Company operates are highly competitive, with new products and surgical procedures being introduced on an ongoing basis. Such marketplace changes may cause some of the Company's products to become obsolete. The Company makes estimates regarding the future recoverability of the costs of these products and records a provision for excess and obsolete inventories based on historical experience, expiration of sterilization dates and expected future trends. If actual product life cycles, product demand or acceptance of new product introductions are less favorable than projected by management, additional inventory write-downs may be required, which could unfavorably affect future operating results. 34 Income Taxes The Company operates in multiple tax jurisdictions both inside and outside the United States. Accordingly, management must determine the appropriate allocation of income to each of these jurisdictions. Tax audits associated with the allocation of this income and other complex issues, including inventory transfer pricing and product royalty arrangements, may require an extended period of time to resolve and may result in income tax adjustments if changes to the income allocation are required between jurisdictions with different tax rates. Because tax adjustments in certain jurisdictions can be significant, the Company records accruals representing management's best estimate of the probable resolution of these matters. These income tax accruals are included within the income taxes liability in the consolidated balance sheets. To the extent additional information becomes available, such accruals are adjusted to reflect the revised estimated probable outcome. Other Matters The Company distributes its products throughout the world. As a result, the Company's financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets. The Company's operating results are primarily exposed to changes in exchange rates among the United States dollar and the Japanese yen and European currencies, in particular the euro and the British pound. When the United States dollar weakens against foreign currencies, the dollar value of sales denominated in foreign currencies increases. When the United States dollar strengthens, the opposite situation occurs. The Company manufactures its products in the United States, France, Germany, Ireland, Switzerland, Canada and Puerto Rico and incurs the costs to manufacture in the applicable local currencies. This worldwide deployment of factories serves to partially mitigate the impact of currency exchange rate changes on the Company's cost of sales. The Company enters into forward currency exchange contracts to mitigate the impact of currency fluctuations on transactions denominated in nonfunctional currencies, thereby limiting risk to the Company that would otherwise result from changes in exchange rates. These nonfunctional currency exposures principally relate to intercompany receivables and payables arising from intercompany purchases of manufactured products. The periods of the forward currency exchange contracts correspond to the periods of the exposed transactions, with realized gains and losses included in the measurement and recording of transactions denominated in the nonfunctional currencies. At December 31, 2005, the Company had outstanding forward currency exchange contracts to purchase $131.6 million and sell $92.1 million of various currencies (principally United States dollars and euros) with maturities ranging principally from 30 to 180 days. The estimated fair value of forward currency exchange contracts represents the measurement of the contracts at month-end spot rates as adjusted by current forward points. A hypothetical 10% change in exchange rates for these currencies would change the December 31, 2005 fair value by approximately $0.2 million. The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties on its outstanding forward currency exchange contracts but does not anticipate nonperformance by any of the counterparties. The Company has certain investments in net assets in international locations that are not hedged. These investments are subject to translation gains and losses due to changes in foreign currencies that are deferred and recorded as a separate component of shareholders' equity. For the year ended December 31, 2005, the weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar decreased the value of these investments in net assets, and the related deferred gain in shareholders' equity, by $192.9 million to $17.0 million. The Company is partially self-insured for product liability claims and utilizes a wholly owned captive insurance company in the United States to manage its self-insured retention limits. The captive insurance company provides insurance reserves for estimated liabilities for product claims incurred but not reported based on actuarially determined liabilities. The actuarial valuations are based on historical information along with certain assumptions about future events. 35 In December 2003, the Company announced that it and its subsidiary Physiotherapy Associates, Inc., received a subpoena from the United States Attorney's Office in Boston, Massachusetts, in connection with a Department of Justice investigation of Physiotherapy Associates' billing and coding practices. In March 2005, the Company announced that it received a subpoena from the United States Department of Justice requesting documents for the period January 2002 through the present relating to ""any and all consulting contracts, professional service agreements, or remuneration agreements between Stryker Corporation and any orthopedic surgeon, orthopedic surgeon in training, or medical school graduate using or considering the surgical use of hip or knee joint replacement/reconstruction products manufactured or sold by Stryker Corporation."" The Company is fully cooperating with the Department of Justice regarding these matters. In December 2004, the FASB issued a revision to Statement No. 123, Share-Based Payment. This revision supersedes Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and its related implementation guidance. On April 14, 2005, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission adopted a new rule allowing companies to delay the required adoption date of the revised Statement to their first fiscal year beginning after June 15, 2005. Based on this ruling, the Company will adopt the provisions of the revised Statement effective January 1, 2006 rather than July 1, 2005 as initially required by the revised Statement. The revised Statement requires companies to recognize the cost of stock options based on the grant-date fair value determined under their employee stock option plans over the period during which the recipient is required to provide services in exchange for the options, typically the vesting period. The Company plans to adopt the provisions of the revised Statement using the modified-retrospective transition method provided in the revised Statement. Under this method, the Company will restate all prior periods presented on a consistent basis, based on the pro forma expense previously disclosed under Statement No. 123. As a result, the Company's net earnings for 2005, 2004 and 2003 will be reduced by $31.6 million, $25.7 million and $19.1 million, respectively, or $.08, $.06, and $.04 per diluted share, respectively. The Company does not believe the adoption of the revised Statement will have a material impact on the trend of net earnings or net earnings per share. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk are included in the Results of Operations and Other Matters sections of the Company's Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition on pages 25 through 31 and 34 through 35, respectively. 36",2023-12-30 18:42:57.269018
310764,SYK,STRYKER CORP,2007,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Throughout this discussion, references are made to the following financial measures: ""constant currency,"" ""adjusted net earnings,"" ""adjusted basic net earnings per share"" and ""adjusted diluted net earnings per share."" These financial measures do not replace the presentation of Stryker Corporation's (the Company or Stryker) reported financial results under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The Company has provided these supplemental non-GAAP financial measures because they provide meaningful information regarding the Company's results on a consistent and comparable basis for the periods presented. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures for reviewing the operating results of its business segments, for analyzing potential future business trends in connection with its budget process and bases certain annual bonus plans on these non-GAAP financial measures. In order to measure the Company's sales performance on a constant currency basis, it is necessary to remove the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates which affects the comparability and trend of sales. In order to measure the Company's earnings performance on a consistent and comparable basis, it is necessary to exclude certain items that affect the comparability of operating results and the trend of earnings. These items include purchased in-process research and development charges recorded in 2006, 2005 and 2004 and the additional income taxes associated with the repatriation of foreign earnings recorded in 2005. Additional details regarding the nature, determination and financial statement impact of these items are included in Results of Operations. Given the nature of these items, management believes that excluding them from certain financial metrics is more representative of the Company's past and potential future operational performance. In addition, the Company believes investors will utilize this information to evaluate period-to-period results on a comparable basis and to better understand potential future operating results. The Company encourages investors and other users of these financial statements to review its Consolidated Financial Statements and other publicly filed reports in their entirety and not to rely solely on any single financial measure. Executive Level Overview Stryker is one of the world's leading medical technology companies with the most broadly based range of products in orthopaedics and a significant presence in other medical specialties. Stryker works with respected medical professionals to help people lead more active and more satisfying lives. The Company's products include implants used in joint replacement, trauma, craniomaxillofacial and spinal surgeries; biologics; surgical, neurologic, ear, nose & throat and interventional pain equipment; endoscopic, surgical navigation, communications and digital imaging systems; as well as patient handling and emergency medical equipment. Stryker also provides outpatient physical therapy services in the United States. - 25 - The Company segregates its operations into two reportable business segments: Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment. The Orthopaedic Implants segment sells orthopaedic reconstructive (hip, knee and shoulder), trauma, spinal and craniomaxillofacial implant systems, bone cement and the bone growth factor OP-1. The MedSurg Equipment segment sells surgical equipment; surgical navigation systems; endoscopic, communications and digital imaging systems; as well as patient handling and emergency medical equipment. The Other category includes Physical Therapy Services and corporate administration, interest expense and interest and marketable securities income. Domestic sales accounted for 66% of total revenues in 2006. Most of the Company's products are marketed directly to doctors, hospitals and other health-care facilities by approximately 3,200 sales and marketing personnel in the United States. Stryker primarily maintains separate and dedicated sales forces for each of its principal product lines to provide focus and a high level of expertise to each medical specialty served. International sales accounted for 34% of total revenues in 2006. The Company's products are sold in more than 100 countries through both Company-owned sales subsidiaries and branches as well as third-party dealers and distributors. The Company's business is generally not seasonal in nature; however, the number of orthopaedic implant surgeries is lower during the summer months. In the first quarter of 2006, the Company acquired all of the outstanding stock of Sightline Technologies Ltd. (Sightline), a private, development-stage company, for an upfront payment of $50.0 million in cash plus certain transaction costs and the assumption of certain liabilities. Sightline is a developer of flexible endoscopes that should improve insertion and sterilization during colonoscopy procedures. This acquisition is expected to enhance the Company's presence in the gastrointestinal and other markets within its MedSurg Equipment segment. In the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company acquired, by merger, all of the outstanding stock of PlasmaSol Corp. (PlasmaSol). PlasmaSol has developed a technology that should allow Stryker to provide sterilization equipment for use with certain of its MedSurg Equipment products. The cost of the transaction totaled $17.5 million including an upfront cash payment plus the assumption of certain liabilities. In the first quarter of 2005, the Company acquired, by merger, all of the outstanding stock of eTrauma.com Corp. (eTrauma) for $50.0 million in cash plus certain transaction costs. The acquisition expanded the Company's digital imaging equipment product offerings within its MedSurg Equipment segment by adding eTrauma's proprietary Picture Archive and Communications Systems (PACS) image management and viewing software. In the third quarter of 2004, the Company acquired, by merger, all of the outstanding stock of SpineCore, Inc. (SpineCore), for an upfront payment of $120.0 million in cash plus certain transaction costs. SpineCore is a developer of artificial lumbar and cervical discs. This acquisition is expected to enhance the Company's presence in the spinal implant market, an important growth area within its Orthopaedic Implants segment. Additional details, including the financial statement impacts resulting from these acquisitions, are included in Results of Operations. On December 31, 2006, the Company adopted the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement No. 158, Employers' Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans - an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R). The Statement requires an entity to recognize, on its balance sheet, an asset or liability reflecting the funded status of defined benefit postretirement plans as the difference between the projected benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets with changes continuing to be reflected in the accumulated other comprehensive gain (loss) component of shareholders' equity net of related income taxes. This Statement does not change the calculation of the amount of net periodic benefit cost included in net earnings. As a result of the adoption of the Statement, the funded status of the Company's defined benefit pension plans resulted in the recognition, in the Company's December 31, 2006 consolidated balance sheet, of an - 26 - additional $22.8 million liability with corresponding changes in accumulated other comprehensive gain (loss) and deferred income taxes. The adoption of the Statement did not require a restatement of prior periods. Effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted the provisions of FASB Statement No. 123 (revised), Share-Based Payment. The revised Statement requires companies to measure the cost of employee stock options based on the grant-date fair value and recognize that cost over the period during which a recipient is required to provide services in exchange for the options, typically the vesting period. The Company adopted the provisions of the revised Statement using the modified-retrospective transition method provided in the revised Statement. Under this method, the Company restated all prior periods presented on a consistent basis, based on the pro forma expense previously disclosed. Additional details, including the financial statement impact resulting from this adoption, are included in Results of Operations. In the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company completed the repatriation of $722 million of foreign earnings under the provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act (the Act). The Act provided a temporary incentive for United States companies to repatriate accumulated income earned in foreign jurisdictions at a reduced income tax cost. Additional details, including the financial statement impact resulting from the repatriation of funds, are included in Results of Operations. Outlook for 2007 The Company's outlook for 2007 continues to be optimistic regarding underlying growth rates in orthopaedic procedures and the Company's broadly based range of products in orthopaedics and other medical specialties, despite the potential for increased pricing pressure in certain markets. The Company projects that diluted net earnings per share for 2007 will approximate $2.42, representing a 28% increase over diluted net earnings per share of $1.89 for the year ended December 31, 2006. Excluding the impact of the charge to write off purchased in-process research and development associated with the acquisition of Sightline in 2006, as more fully described in Results of Operations, the Company projects that diluted net earnings per share for 2007 will increase 20% over adjusted diluted net earnings per share of $2.02 for the year ended December 31, 2006. The financial forecast for 2007 includes a constant currency net sales increase in the range of 11% to 13% as a result of growth in shipments of Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment which is comparable to the 11% constant currency net sales increase reported for the full year of 2006. If foreign currency exchange rates hold near current levels, the Company anticipates a favorable impact on net sales of approximately 1% to 2% in the first quarter of 2007 and a favorable impact on net sales of approximately 0% to 1% for the full year of 2007. - 27 - Results of Operations The table below outlines the components of the consolidated statements of earnings as a percentage of net sales and the year-to-year percentage change in dollar amounts: Percentage of Net Sales Percentage Change 2006 2005 2004 2006/2005 2005/2004 Net sales 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% 11% 14% Cost of sales 34.2 35.3 35.5 8 14 Gross profit 65.8 64.7 64.5 13 15 Research, development and engineering expenses 6.0 5.8 5.0 14 32 Selling, general and administrative expenses 38.1 38.0 39.5 11 10 Intangibles amortization 0.8 1.0 1.1 (11) 2 Purchased in-process research and development 1.0 0.3 2.8 231 (87) Operating income 19.9 19.5 16.0 13 39 Other income (expense) 0.5 0.1 (0.1) 556 -- Earnings before income taxes 20.4 19.6 15.9 16 41 Income taxes 6.0 6.4 5.6 5 31 Net earnings 14.4% 13.2% 10.3% 21 46 The table below sets forth domestic/international and product line sales information: Net Sales (in millions) Percentage Change 2006 2005 2004 2006/2005 2005/2004 Domestic/international sales: Domestic $3,556.8 $3,165.6 $2,753.0 12% 15% International 1,848.8 1,705.9 1,509.3 8 13 Total net sales $5,405.6 $4,871.5 $4,262.3 11 14 Product line sales: Orthopaedic Implants $3,110.1 $2,849.5 $2,556.2 9 11 MedSurg Equipment 2,037.1 1,759.4 1,461.2 16 20 Physical Therapy Services 258.4 262.6 244.9 (2) 7 Total net sales $5,405.6 $4,871.5 $4,262.3 11 14 - 28 - The table below sets forth additional sales growth information for significant products within the Company's Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment product lines on both a reported basis and a constant currency basis: Percentage Change 2006/2005 2005/2004 Constant Constant Reported Currency Reported Currency Worldwide Orthopaedic Implants sales: Hips 2% 2% 4% 4% Knees 12 12 14 14 Trauma 13 14 17 17 Spine 18 18 17 17 Craniomaxillofacial 16 16 8 7 Worldwide MedSurg Equipment sales: Surgical equipment and surgical navigation systems 12 12 16 16 Endoscopic, communications and digital imaging systems 19 19 24 24 Patient handling and emergency medical equipment 18 17 23 22 2006 Compared with 2005 Stryker Corporation's net sales increased 11% in 2006 to $5,405.6 million from $4,871.5 million in 2005. Net sales grew by 10% as a result of increased unit volume and changes in product mix and 1% as a result of higher selling prices. Domestic sales were $3,556.8 million for 2006, representing an increase of 12% as a result of higher shipments of Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment. International sales were $1,848.8 million for 2006, representing an increase of 8% as a result of higher shipments of Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment. The impact of foreign currency comparisons to the dollar value of international sales was unfavorable by $5.2 million for 2006. On a constant currency basis, international sales increased 9% in 2006. Worldwide sales of Orthopaedic Implants were $3,110.1 million for 2006, representing an increase of 9%, on both a reported and constant currency basis, as a result of higher shipments of reconstructive, trauma, spinal and craniomaxillofacial implant systems; bone cement; and the bone growth factor OP-1. Hip Implant Systems: Sales of hip implant systems increased 2% during the year on both a reported and constant currency basis. In the United States, sales growth was driven by sales of the recently launched X3 polyethylene and increased sales in Accolade cementless hip products and Restoration Modular Hip System revision hip products, partially offset by declines in sales of other hip systems. Solid growth in the Trident Hip System, Accolade cementless hip products and Restoration Modular Hip System revision hip products in Europe as well as solid growth in Accolade cementless hip products and the Trident Hip System in the Pacific region also contributed to the sales growth in hip implant systems. Knee Implant Systems: Sales of knee implant systems increased 12% during the year, on both a reported and constant currency basis, due to strong growth in the Triathlon Knee System in the United States, Europe and the Pacific region and solid growth in the Scorpio Knee System in most international markets, partially offset by slower growth in Japan as a result of government imposed price cuts. - 29 - Trauma Implant Systems: Sales of trauma implant systems increased 13% during the year, 14% on a constant currency basis, as a result of strong worldwide sales growth in the Gamma3 Hip Fracture System and strong sales growth in the T2 Nailing System in the United States and Europe, partially offset by slower growth in Japan as a result of the price cuts. Spinal Implant Systems: Sales of spinal implant systems increased 18% during the year, on both a reported and constant currency basis, primarily due to strong worldwide sales growth of interbody devices led by sales of the AVS vertebral spacer system as well as solid worldwide sales growth in thoraco-lumbar products. Craniomaxillofacial Implant Systems: Sales of craniomaxillofacial implant systems increased 16% during the year, on both a reported and constant currency basis, as a result of strong domestic sales growth led by products for neurologic indications and craniomaxillofacial implants. Worldwide sales of MedSurg Equipment were $2,037.1 million for 2006, representing an increase of 16%, on both a reported and constant currency basis, as a result of higher shipments of surgical equipment; surgical navigation systems; endoscopic, communications and digital imaging systems; as well as patient handling and emergency medical equipment. Surgical Equipment and Surgical Navigation Systems: Sales of surgical equipment and surgical navigation systems increased 12% during the year, on both a reported and constant currency basis, due to strong domestic sales growth in surgical navigation systems and operating room equipment and solid domestic sales growth in interventional pain products. Strong sales growth in powered surgical instruments outside the United States also led to the Company's sales growth. Endoscopic,Communications and Digital Imaging Systems: Sales of endoscopic, communications and digital imaging systems increased 19% during the year, on both a reported and constant currency basis, as a result of strong worldwide sales growth in medical video imaging equipment led by the recently launched 1188 HD Camera and related accessories as well as imaging and communications products. Strong worldwide sales growth in general surgery products also contributed to the Company's sales growth. Patient Handling and Emergency Medical Equipment: Sales of patient handling and emergency medical equipment increased 18% during the year, 17% on a constant currency basis, due to strong sales growth in hospital bed products in the United States, Latin America and Canada, strong domestic sales growth in emergency medical equipment as well as solid stretcher sales growth in Europe and Latin America. Physical Therapy Services revenues were $258.4 million for 2006, representing a decrease of 2% primarily due to lower revenues from existing centers. Cost of sales represented 34.2% of sales in 2006 compared with 35.3% in 2005. The lower cost of sales percentage in 2006 is primarily due to lower excess and obsolete inventory costs as a result of fewer comparative product introductions during the year and reduced royalty costs related to the expiration of certain royalty agreements partially offset by faster sales growth in the lower margin MedSurg Equipment segment. Research, development and engineering expenses represented 6.0% of sales in 2006 compared with 5.8% in 2005. These expenses increased 14% in 2006 to $324.6 million. The higher spending level is the result of the Company's continued focus on new product development for anticipated future product launches and continued investments in new technologies. New product introductions in 2006 for the Orthopaedic Implants segment included the LFIT Anatomic Femoral Heads with X3 polyethylene liners which address range of motion and dislocation potential and the AVS AS Spacer which is used for anterior lumbar interbody fusion. Within the MedSurg Equipment segment, new product introductions in 2006 included the 1188 HD Camera and related accessories, the next generation of Stryker 3-Chip HD Cameras, the System 6 heavy duty power system and the Precision Oscillating Tip Saw which features a stationary blade shaft with an oscillating tip. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 11% in 2006 and represented 38.1% of sales compared with 38.0% in 2005. The slight increase in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of - 30 - sales in 2006 is due to higher sales-related costs, primarily compensation, loaner instrumentation amortization and sample expenses, partially offset by decreases in insurance costs and slower growth in discretionary spending. The purchased in-process research and development charge of $52.7 million recorded in the first quarter of 2006 relates to the acquisition of Sightline. At the date of the acquisition, the flexible endoscope technologies acquired had not yet reached technological feasibility. The upfront payment of $50.0 million, plus certain transaction costs and the assumption of certain liabilities, was preliminarily allocated to assets acquired, purchased in-process research and development and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition. The purchased in-process research and development charge of $15.9 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2005 relates to the acquisition of PlasmaSol. At the date of the acquisition, the sterilization technology acquired had not yet been approved for sale by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and, therefore, had not yet reached technological feasibility. The purchase price of $17.5 million was allocated to assets acquired, primarily for deferred income tax assets associated with acquired net operating losses, and purchased in-process research and development based on their fair value at the date of acquisition. The Company believes that the technologies acquired in both the Sightline and PlasmaSol acquisitions will result in the introduction of new products and additional future sales. However, factors including regulatory delays, safety concerns or patent disputes could delay the introduction or marketing of these potential new products. Additionally, unanticipated issues may arise during current and future clinical trials that could delay or terminate a product's development prior to regulatory approval. The Company may experience an unfavorable impact on its operating results if it is unable to capitalize on those efforts by attaining the proper FDA approval. As of December 31, 2006, the Company has not encountered significant issues and expects completion of the development and initial commercialization of the flexible endoscope technologies and the sterilization technologies in 2007 and 2008, respectively. As a result of the adoption of FASB Statement No. 123 (revised) requiring the expensing of stock options, the Company's operating income for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 was reduced by $56.2 million and $48.7 million, respectively, and the Company's net earnings for the same periods were reduced by $36.5 million and $31.6 million, respectively. Basic and diluted net earnings per share for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 were reduced by $.09 and $.08, respectively. Interest and marketable securities income, which is included in other income (expense), increased to $41.4 million in 2006 from $13.3 million in 2005, primarily as a result of increased cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities balances compared to the year earlier period. Interest expense, which is included in other income (expense), increased to $9.5 million in 2006 from $7.7 million in 2005, primarily as a result of borrowings in Europe to complete the repatriation of foreign earnings in the fourth quarter of 2005. The Company's effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2006 was 29.5% as compared to an effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2005 of 32.6%. The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2006 reflects the impact of the nondeductibility for income tax purposes of the purchased in-process research and development charge associated with the acquisition of Sightline. The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2005 reflects the impact of the nondeductibility for income tax purposes of the purchased in-process research and development charge associated with the acquisition of PlasmaSol as well as the income taxes associated with the repatriation of foreign earnings. After considering these factors, the Company's reported effective income tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 are lower than the United States statutory income tax rate primarily as a result of manufacturing in lower tax, international jurisdictions. Net earnings in 2006 increased 21% to $777.7 million from $643.6 million in 2005; basic net earnings per share increased 20% to $1.91 in 2006 from $1.59 in 2005; and diluted net earnings per share increased 20% to $1.89 in 2006 from $1.57 in 2005. Excluding the impacts of the charges to write off purchased in-process research and development in 2006 and 2005 and to recognize the income tax expense associated with the repatriation of foreign earnings in 2005, adjusted net earnings increased 21% to $830.4 million in 2006 from $686.9 million in 2005. Adjusted basic net - 31 - earnings per share increased 20% to $2.04 in 2006 from $1.70 in 2005, and adjusted diluted net earnings per share increased 21% to $2.02 in 2006 from $1.67 in 2005. The reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures are as follows (in millions except per share amounts): 2006 2005 % Change Reported net earnings $777.7 $643.6 21% Purchased in-process research and development 52.7 15.9 231 Income taxes on repatriation of foreign earnings -- 27.4 -- Adjusted net earnings $830.4 $686.9 21 Basic net earnings per share: Reported basic net earnings per share $1.91 $1.59 20 Purchased in-process research and development $.13 $.04 225 Income taxes on repatriation of foreign earnings -- $.07 -- Adjusted basic net earnings per share $2.04 $1.70 20 Weighted-average basic shares outstanding 406.5 403.7 Diluted net earnings per share: Reported diluted net earnings per share $1.89 $1.57 20 Purchased in-process research and development $.13 $.04 225 Income taxes on repatriation of foreign earnings -- $.07 -- Adjusted diluted net earnings per share $2.02 $1.67 21 Weighted-average diluted shares outstanding 411.8 410.8 The weighted-average basic and diluted shares outstanding used in the calculation of these non-GAAP financial measures are the same as the weighted-average shares outstanding used in the calculation of the reported per share amounts. 2005 Compared with 2004 Stryker Corporation's net sales increased 14% in 2005 to $4,871.5 million from $4,262.3 million in 2004. Net sales grew by 12% as a result of increased unit volume and changes in product mix, 1% related to higher selling prices and 1% due to acquisitions. Domestic sales were $3,165.6 million for 2005, representing an increase of 15% as a result of higher shipments of Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment and higher revenue from Physical Therapy Services. International sales were $1,705.9 million for 2005, representing an increase of 13% as a result of higher shipments of Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment. The impact of foreign currency comparisons to the dollar value of international sales was favorable by $11.5 million for 2005. On a constant currency basis, international sales increased 12% in 2005. Worldwide sales of Orthopaedic Implants were $2,849.5 million for 2005, representing an increase of 11% as a result of higher shipments of reconstructive, trauma, spinal and craniomaxillofacial implant systems; bone cement; and the bone growth factor OP-1. Sales of Orthopaedic Implants also increased 11% for the year on a constant currency basis. Hip Implant Systems: Sales of hip implant systems increased 4% during the year, on both a reported and constant currency basis, due to growth in sales of the Trident Hip System in Europe and the Pacific region and in Accolade cementless hip products and Restoration Modular Hip System revision hips in the United States, partially offset by lower sales of the Trident ceramic-on-ceramic hip system and hip fracture products in the United States. - 32 - Knee Implant Systems: Sales of knee implant systems increased 14% during the year, on both a reported and constant currency basis, due to strong sales growth in the recently launched Triathlon Knee System in the United States, Europe and the Pacific region as well as the Scorpio Knee System in Europe, Japan and the Pacific region. Trauma Implant Systems: Sales of trauma implant systems increased 17% during the year, on both a reported and constant currency basis, as a result of the full-scale launch of the Gamma3 Hip Fracture System in the United States, Japan and Europe in the second half of 2004. Strong growth in the Company's T2 Nailing System, both in the United States and internationally, also drove trauma sales growth in 2005. Spinal Implant Systems: Sales of spinal implant systems increased 17% during the year, on both a reported and constant currency basis, primarily due to strong sales growth of interbody devices in the United States led by sales of the recently launched AVS spacer products as well as solid worldwide growth in cervical and thoraco-lumbar product sales. Craniomaxillofacial Implant Systems: Sales of craniomaxillofacial implant systems increased 8% during the year, 7% on a constant currency basis, as a result of solid domestic sales of products for neurologic indications. Worldwide sales of MedSurg Equipment were $1,759.4 million for 2005, representing an increase of 20% as a result of higher shipments of surgical equipment; surgical navigation systems; endoscopic, communications and digital imaging systems; as well as patient handling and emergency medical equipment. Sales of MedSurg Equipment also increased 20% for the year on a constant currency basis. Surgical Equipment and Surgical Navigation Systems: Sales of surgical equipment and surgical navigation systems increased 16% during the year, on both a reported and constant currency basis, due to strong worldwide sales growth in the System 5 heavy-duty powered system, interventional pain products, Sterishield personal protection systems and surgical navigation products as well as strong sales growth in the Neptune operating waste management system in the United States. Endoscopic,Communications and Digital Imaging Systems: Sales of endoscopic, communications and digital imaging systems increased 24% during the year, on both a reported and constant currency basis, as a result of strong sales growth in medical video imaging equipment, led by growth of digital imaging equipment and the 1088 HD Camera, and strong growth in general surgery products in the United States, partially offset by slower sales growth in arthroscopy in the United States resulting from the discontinuance of allograft products during the year. Patient Handling and Emergency Medical Equipment: Sales of patient handling and emergency medical equipment increased 23% during the year, 22% on a constant currency basis, due to strong sales growth in hospital and maternity beds and emergency medical equipment in the United States and solid stretcher growth in the U. S. market. Physical Therapy Services revenues were $262.6 million for 2005, representing an increase of 7% with all of the growth coming from new physical therapy centers. Cost of sales represented 35.3% of sales in 2005 compared with 35.5% in 2004. The lower cost of sales percentage in 2005 is partially due to increased average selling prices for the Company's products and lower excess and obsolete inventory costs associated with discontinued products, partially offset by faster sales growth in the lower margin MedSurg Equipment segment and higher growth in royalty costs relative to sales growth. Research, development and engineering expenses represented 5.8% of sales in 2005 compared with 5.0% in 2004. These expenses increased 32% in 2005 to $284.7 million. The higher spending level is the result of the Company's continued focus on new product development for anticipated future product launches and continued investments in new technologies, together with, beginning in the third quarter of 2004, spending associated with the continued development of products acquired from SpineCore. New product introductions in 2005 in the Orthopaedic Implants segment included X3 polyethylene, the Company's next-generation highly crosslinked polyethylene featuring a higher level of strength and wear reduction in both hip and knee replacements, and the - 33 - posteriorly stabilized version of the Triathlon Knee System in the United States, Europe, Canada and the Pacific region. Within the MedSurg Equipment segment, new product introductions in 2005 included the Maestro drill, which expanded the Company's line of micro powered instruments for spine; neurologic; and ear, nose & throat applications. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 10% in 2005 and represented 38.0% of sales compared with 39.5% in 2004. The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales in 2005 is due to lower meeting costs and slower growth in advertising costs and insurance premiums relative to the Company's growth in net sales. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in sales commission expense as a result of the 14% growth in net sales in 2005 in addition to higher amortization expense associated with loaner instrument sets. The purchased in-process research and development charge of $15.9 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2005 relates to the acquisition of PlasmaSol, as previously described. The purchased in-process research and development charge of $120.8 million recorded in the third quarter of 2004 relates to the acquisition of SpineCore, a private, development-stage company. At the date of the acquisition, the artificial lumbar and cervical spinal disc implant technologies acquired were in preliminary stages of clinical studies in the United States and had not yet reached technological feasibility. The upfront payment of $120.0 million, plus certain transaction costs, was allocated to assets acquired, purchased in-process research and development and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition. The Company believes that the technologies acquired in both the PlasmaSol and SpineCore acquisitions will result in the introduction of new products and additional future sales. However, factors including regulatory delays, safety concerns or patent disputes could delay the introduction or marketing of these potential new products. Additionally, unanticipated issues may arise during current and future clinical trials that could delay or terminate a product's development prior to regulatory approval. The Company may experience an unfavorable impact on its operating results if it is unable to capitalize on those efforts by attaining the proper FDA approval. As of December 31, 2006, the Company had not encountered significant issues and expects completion of the development and initial commercialization of both the sterilization technologies and spinal disc implant technologies beginning in 2008. As a result of the adoption of FASB Statement No. 123 (revised), the Company's operating income for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 was reduced by $48.7 million and $38.9 million, respectively, and the Company's net earnings for the same periods were reduced by $31.6 million and $25.7 million, respectively. Basic and diluted net earnings per share for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 were reduced by $.08 and $.06, respectively. Interest and marketable securities income, which is included in other income (expense), increased to $13.3 million in 2005 from $4.7 million in 2004, primarily due to increased cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities balances compared to the year earlier period. Interest expense, which is included in other income (expense), increased to $7.7 million in 2005 from $6.8 million in 2004, primarily as a result of increased borrowings in Europe to complete the repatriation of foreign earnings in the fourth quarter of 2005. The effective income tax rate was 32.6% for the year ended December 31, 2005 and 35.1% for the year ended December 31, 2004. The effective income tax rate for 2005 reflects a charge of $27.4 million to recognize the income tax expense and related liability associated with the repatriation of $722 million of foreign earnings under the provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act completed in the fourth quarter. The effective income tax rate for 2005 also reflects the impact of the nondeductibility for income tax purposes of the purchased in-process research and development charge associated with the acquisition of PlasmaSol. The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2004 reflects the impact of the nondeductibility for income tax purposes of the purchased in-process research and development charge associated with the acquisition of SpineCore. After considering these factors, the Company's reported effective income tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 are lower than the United States statutory income tax rate primarily as a result of manufacturing in lower tax, international jurisdictions. - 34 - Net earnings in 2005 increased 46% to $643.6 million from $440.0 million in 2004; basic net earnings per share increased 45% to $1.59 in 2005 from $1.10 in 2004; and diluted net earnings per share increased 45% to $1.57 in 2005 from $1.08 in 2004. Excluding the impacts of the charges to write off purchased in-process research and development in 2005 and 2004 and to recognize income tax expense associated with the repatriation of foreign earnings in 2005, adjusted net earnings increased 22% to $686.9 million in 2005 from $560.8 million in 2004. Adjusted basic net earnings per share increased 21% to $1.70 in 2005 from $1.40 in 2004, and adjusted diluted net earnings per share increased 22% to $1.67 in 2005 from $1.37 in 2004. The reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures are as follows (in millions except per share amounts): 2005 2004 % Change Reported net earnings $643.6 $440.0 46% Purchased in-process research and development 15.9 120.8 (87) Income taxes on repatriation of foreign earnings 27.4 -- -- Adjusted net earnings $686.9 $560.8 22 Basic net earnings per share: Reported basic net earnings per share $1.59 $1.10 45 Purchased in-process research and development $.04 $.30 (87) Income taxes on repatriation of foreign earnings $.07 -- -- Adjusted basic net earnings per share $1.70 $1.40 21 Weighted-average basic shares outstanding 403.7 401.2 Diluted net earnings per share: Reported diluted net earnings per share $1.57 $1.08 45 Purchased in-process research and development $.04 $.30 (87) Income taxes on repatriation of foreign earnings $.07 -- -- Adjusted diluted net earnings per share $1.67 $1.37 22 Weighted-average diluted shares outstanding 410.8 409.3 The weighted-average basic and diluted shares outstanding used in the calculation of these non-GAAP financial measures are the same as the weighted-average shares outstanding used in the calculation of the reported per share amounts. Liquidity and Capital Resources The Company's working capital at December 31, 2006 increased $561.5 million to $2,182.8 million from $1,621.3 million at December 31, 2005. The increase in working capital resulted from growth in the Company's overall business and the use of cash earnings to fund increases in accounts receivable, inventories and prepaid expenses. Accounts receivable days sales outstanding was 56 days at December 31, 2006 compared with 54 days at December 31, 2005. Days sales in inventory increased 8 days to 122 days at December 31, 2006 from 114 days at December 31, 2005. The increase in days sales in inventory at December 31, 2006 is primarily due to higher levels of inventory in support of anticipated product launches and first quarter sales as well as management's effort to run the manufacturing plants at a steady rate during the year. The Company generated cash of $867.3 million from operations in 2006 compared with $833.4 million in 2005. The increase in cash from operations in 2006 compared with the prior year is primarily due to increased earnings partially offset by growth in the working capital accounts, primarily inventories and accounts receivable. - 35 - In 2006, the Company used cash of $217.5 million for capital expenditures, including $29.4 million related to the implementation of ERP systems at multiple manufacturing and distribution facilities; $24.1 million for the expansion of the Company's OP-1 manufacturing facility in Lebanon, New Hampshire; $17.5 million for the new corporate headquarters in Kalamazoo, Michigan; and $12.5 million for construction of the Homer Stryker Center for education and clinical research in Mahwah, New Jersey. In addition, the Company used cash of $97.1 million for acquisitions and $44.6 million for the payment of dividends. The Company also purchases and sells marketable securities, which are classified as available-for-sale investments in accordance with the provisions of FASB Statement No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities. Marketable securities totaled $998.2 million at December 31, 2006. In addition to the acquisitions discussed previously, the Company acquired eTrauma in the first quarter of 2005 for an upfront payment of $50.0 million in cash plus certain transaction costs. The acquisition of eTrauma was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. The results of operations for the acquired business are included in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements from the date of the acquisition and did not materially impact the Company's reported operating results. Pro forma consolidated results of operations would not differ significantly as a result of the eTrauma acquisition. The purchase price for eTrauma was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition. Based on the purchase price allocation, $22.0 million was allocated to identifiable intangible assets, to be amortized over their remaining lives of 5 to 8 years, and $30.2 million was allocated to goodwill. Immediately after the acquisition was consummated, management of the Company began to implement an integration plan to combine Stryker and eTrauma. In conjunction with the integration plan, the Company recorded additional purchase liabilities for severance and related costs of $0.3 million, which were included in the purchase price allocation. The Company had $416.6 million in cash and cash equivalents and $998.2 million in marketable securities at December 31, 2006. The Company also had outstanding borrowings totaling $14.8 million at that date, all of which were classified as current obligations. The Company believes its cash on hand and marketable securities, as well as anticipated cash flows from operations, will be sufficient to fund future operating capital requirements; future manufacturing facility construction and other capital expenditures; future business and product line acquisitions to supplement its current product offerings; loaner instrumentation for surgical implants in support of new product launches; required debt repayments and the payment of dividends. Should additional funds be required, the Company had $1,028.1 million of additional borrowing capacity available under all of its existing credit facilities, including the Company's $1,000.0 million 5-year nonamortizing, revolving Unsecured Credit Facility that expires in November 2010. In addition, the Company had $200.0 million of eligible accounts receivable that could be sold through its accounts receivable securitization facility at December 31, 2006. The Company's future contractual obligations for agreements with initial terms greater than 1 year, including agreements to purchase materials in the normal course of business, are summarized as follows (in millions): Payment Period 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter Long-term debt $14.8 $-- $-- $-- $-- $-- Operating leases 62.1 51.3 38.5 22.7 13.3 25.4 Unconditional purchase obligations 208.4 5.5 1.0 -- -- -- - 36 - The Company's additional borrowing capacity, along with the expected expiration period of the commitments, is summarized as follows (in millions): Amount of Commitment Total Expiration Per Period Amount Less than In excess of Committed 1 year 1 year Unsecured Credit Facility and other lines of credit $1,028.1 $65.8 $962.3 Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Management evaluates these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Estimates are based on historical experience, when available, and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Management believes that of its significant accounting policies (see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), an understanding of the following critical accounting policies is important in obtaining an overall understanding of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses in the collection of accounts receivable. The Company makes estimates regarding the future ability of its customers to make required payments based on historical credit experience and expected future trends. If actual customer financial conditions are less favorable than projected by management, additional accounts receivable write-offs may be necessary, which could unfavorably affect future operating results. Inventory Reserves The Company maintains reserves for excess and obsolete inventory resulting from the potential inability to sell its products at prices in excess of current carrying costs. The markets in which the Company operates are highly competitive and new products and surgical procedures are introduced on an ongoing basis. Such marketplace changes may cause some of the Company's products to become obsolete. The Company makes estimates regarding the future recoverability of the costs of these products and records a provision for excess and obsolete inventories based on historical experience, expiration of sterilization dates and expected future trends. If actual product life cycles, product demand or acceptance of new product introductions are less favorable than projected by management, additional inventory write-downs may be required, which could unfavorably affect future operating results. Income Taxes The Company operates in multiple tax jurisdictions both inside and outside the United States. Accordingly, management must determine the appropriate allocation of income to each of these jurisdictions. Tax audits associated with the allocation of this income and other complex issues, including inventory transfer pricing and product royalty arrangements, may require an extended period of time to resolve and may result in income tax adjustments if changes to the income allocation are required between jurisdictions with different tax rates. Because tax adjustments in certain jurisdictions can be significant, the Company records accruals representing management's best estimate of the probable resolution of these matters. These income tax accruals are included - 37 - within the income taxes liability in the consolidated balance sheets. To the extent additional information becomes available, such accruals are adjusted to reflect the revised estimated probable outcome. Other Matters The Company distributes its products throughout the world. As a result, the Company's financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets. The Company's operating results are primarily exposed to changes in exchange rates among the United States dollar, the Japanese yen and European currencies, in particular the euro and the British pound. When the United States dollar weakens against foreign currencies, the dollar value of sales denominated in foreign currencies increases. When the United States dollar strengthens, the opposite situation occurs. The Company manufactures its products in the United States, France, Germany, Ireland, Switzerland, Canada and Puerto Rico and incurs the costs to manufacture in the applicable local currencies. This worldwide deployment of factories serves to partially mitigate the impact of currency exchange rate changes on the Company's cost of sales. The Company enters into forward currency exchange contracts to mitigate the impact of currency fluctuations on transactions denominated in nonfunctional currencies, thereby limiting risk to the Company that would otherwise result from changes in exchange rates. These nonfunctional currency exposures principally relate to intercompany receivables and payables arising from intercompany purchases of manufactured products. The periods of the forward currency exchange contracts correspond to the periods of the exposed transactions, with realized gains and losses included in the measurement and recording of transactions denominated in the nonfunctional currencies. All forward currency exchange contracts are marked-to-market each period with resulting gains (losses) included in other income (expense) in the consolidated statements of earnings. At December 31, 2006, the Company had outstanding forward currency exchange contracts to purchase $387.9 million and sell $227.0 million of various currencies (principally United States dollars and euros) with maturities ranging principally from 7 to 180 days. At December 31, 2005, the Company had outstanding forward currency exchange contracts to purchase $217.6 million and sell $196.1 million of various currencies (principally United States dollars and euros) with maturities ranging principally from 7 to 180 days. The estimated fair value of forward currency exchange contracts represents the measurement of the contracts at month-end spot rates as adjusted by current forward points. A hypothetical 10% change in foreign currencies relative to the U. S. dollar would change the December 31, 2006 fair value by approximately $9.7 million. The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties on its outstanding forward currency exchange contracts but does not anticipate nonperformance by any of the counterparties. The Company has certain investments in net assets in international locations that are not hedged. These investments are subject to translation gains and losses due to changes in foreign currencies that are deferred and recorded as a separate component of shareholders' equity. For the year ended December 31, 2006, the strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the United States dollar increased the value of these investments in net assets, and the related deferred gain in shareholders' equity, by $102.6 million to $119.6 million from $17.0 million at December 31, 2005. The Company is partially self-insured for product liability claims and utilizes a wholly owned captive insurance company in the United States to manage its self-insured retention limits. The captive insurance company provides insurance reserves for estimated liabilities for product claims incurred but not reported based on actuarially determined liabilities. The actuarial valuations are based on historical information along with certain assumptions about future events. In December 2003, the Company announced that its subsidiary Physiotherapy Associates, Inc., and Stryker received a subpoena from the United States Attorney's Office in Boston, Massachusetts, in connection with a United States Department of Justice investigation of Physiotherapy Associates' billing and coding practices. In March 2005, the Company announced that it received a subpoena from the United States Department of Justice requesting documents for the period January 2002 through the present relating to ""any and - 38 - all consulting contracts, professional service agreements, or remuneration agreements between Stryker Corporation and any orthopedic surgeon, orthopedic surgeon in training, or medical school graduate using or considering the surgical use of hip or knee joint replacement/reconstruction products manufactured or sold by Stryker Corporation."" In June 2006, the Company announced that it received a subpoena from the United States Department of Justice, Antitrust Division, requesting documents for the period January 2001 through the present regarding possible violations of federal criminal law, including possible violation of the antitrust laws, relating to the manufacture and sale of orthopaedic implant devices. The Company is fully cooperating with the Department of Justice regarding these matters. In June 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109. This Interpretation clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing the minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. The Interpretation also provides guidance for the measurement and classification of tax positions, interest and penalties and requires additional disclosure on an annual basis. The Company plans to adopt the provisions of the Interpretation effective January 1, 2007, as required. The Company has not yet determined the effect the adoption of the Interpretation will have on the financial position of the Company but does not anticipate a material impact. Any difference between the amounts recognized in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements prior to the adoption of the Interpretation and the amounts reported after the adoption will be accounted for as a cumulative-effect adjustment recorded in the beginning balance of retained earnings on January 1, 2007 and will not require restatement of prior periods. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk are included in the Results of Operations and Other Matters sections of the Company's Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition on pages 27 through 28 and 37 through 38, respectively. - 39 -",2023-12-30 18:42:55.653477
310764,SYK,STRYKER CORP,2008,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Throughout this discussion, references are made to the following financial measures: ""constant currency,"" ""adjusted net earnings from continuing operations,"" ""adjusted basic net earnings per share from continuing operations"" and ""adjusted diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations."" These financial measures are an alternative representation of Stryker Corporation's (the Company or Stryker) past and potential future operational performance and do not replace the presentation of the Company's reported financial results under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The Company has provided these supplemental non-GAAP financial measures because they provide meaningful information regarding the Company's results on a consistent and comparable basis for the periods presented. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures for reviewing the operating results of its business segments, for analyzing potential future business trends in connection with its budget process and bases certain annual bonus plans on these non-GAAP financial measures. In order to measure the Company's sales performance on a constant currency basis, it is necessary to remove the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates which affects the comparability and trend of sales. Constant currency results are calculated by translating current year results at prior year average foreign currency exchange rates. In order to measure earnings performance on a consistent and comparable basis, the Company excludes the intangible asset impairment charge recorded in 2007, the purchased in-process research and development charges recorded in 2006 and 2005 and the additional income taxes associated with the repatriation of foreign earnings recorded in 2005, each of which affects the comparability of operating results and the trend of earnings. Additional details regarding the nature, determination and financial statement impact of these items are included in Results of Operations. In addition, the Company believes investors will utilize this information to evaluate period-to-period results on a comparable basis and to better understand potential future operating results. The Company encourages investors and other users of these financial statements to review its Consolidated Financial Statements and other publicly filed reports in their entirety and not to rely solely on any single financial measure. Executive Level Overview Stryker is one of the world's leading medical technology companies with the most broadly based range of products in orthopaedics and a significant presence in other medical specialties. Stryker works with respected medical professionals to help people lead more active and more satisfying lives. The Company's products include implants used in joint replacement, trauma, spinal and craniomaxillofacial surgeries; biologics; surgical, neurologic, ear, nose & throat and interventional pain equipment; endoscopic, surgical navigation, communications and digital imaging systems; as well as patient handling and emergency medical equipment. The Company segregates its operations into two reportable business segments: Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment. The Orthopaedic Implants segment sells orthopaedic reconstructive (hip, knee and shoulder), trauma, spinal and craniomaxillofacial implant systems, bone cement and the bone growth factor OP-1. The MedSurg Equipment segment sells surgical equipment; surgical navigation systems; endoscopic, communications and digital imaging systems; as well as patient handling and emergency medical equipment. The Other category includes corporate administration, interest expense and interest and marketable securities income. Domestic sales accounted for 64% of total revenues in 2007. Most of the Company's products are marketed directly to doctors, hospitals and other healthcare facilities by approximately 3,500 sales and marketing personnel in the United States. Stryker primarily maintains separate and dedicated sales forces for each of its principal product lines to provide focus and a high level of expertise to each medical specialty served. International sales accounted for 36% of total revenues in 2007. The Company's products are sold in more than 100 countries through Company-owned sales subsidiaries and branches as well as third-party dealers and distributors. - 27 - The Company's business is generally not seasonal in nature; however, the number of orthopaedic implant surgeries is lower during the summer months. In 2007 the Company announced that it reached a resolution with the U.S. Attorney's office for the District of New Jersey in connection with a previously announced investigation relating to ""any and all consulting contracts, professional service agreements, or remuneration agreements between Stryker Corporation and any orthopedic surgeon, orthopedic surgeon in training, or medical school graduate using or considering the surgical use of hip or knee joint replacement/reconstruction products manufactured or sold by Stryker Corporation."" The resolution is in the form of a non-prosecution agreement for an 18-month period. During the term of the agreement, the Company's Orthopaedics subsidiary is subject to oversight by a federal monitor, as appointed by the U.S. Attorney, regarding compliance with certain standards and procedures in connection with the retention and payment of orthopaedic surgeon consultants related to reconstructive products and the provision of certain benefits to such surgeons. In 2007 the Company sold its outpatient physical therapy business, Physiotherapy Associates, to Water Street Healthcare Partners, for $150.0 million in cash less certain indebtedness. Physiotherapy Associates' operating results are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Additional details, including the financial statement impact resulting from this divestiture, are included in Results of Operations and Other Matters. In 2007 the Company adopted the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes. This Interpretation clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing the minimum recognition threshold an income tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. The Interpretation also provides guidance for the measurement and classification of income tax positions, interest and penalties, and requires additional disclosure on an annual basis. Additional details, including the financial statement impact resulting from this adoption, are included in Results of Operations. In 2006 the Company acquired all of the outstanding stock of Sightline Technologies Ltd. (Sightline), a private, development-stage company, for an upfront payment of $50.0 million in cash plus certain transaction costs and the assumption of certain liabilities. Sightline has developed flexible endoscopes that should improve insertion and sterilization during colonoscopy procedures. Terms of the transaction also include milestone payments of up to an additional $90.0 million upon the achievement of certain operational and financial targets related to Sightline's products, the first of which is expected to occur in 2008. This acquisition is expected to enhance the Company's presence in the gastrointestinal and other markets within its MedSurg Equipment segment. In 2005 the Company acquired, by merger, all of the outstanding stock of PlasmaSol Corp. (PlasmaSol). PlasmaSol has developed a technology that should allow Stryker to provide sterilization equipment for use with certain of its MedSurg Equipment products. The cost of the transaction totaled $17.5 million, including an upfront cash payment plus the assumption of certain liabilities. In 2005 the Company acquired, by merger, all of the outstanding stock of eTrauma.com Corp. (eTrauma) for $50.0 million in cash plus certain transaction costs. The acquisition expanded the Company's digital imaging equipment product offerings within its MedSurg Equipment segment by adding eTrauma's proprietary Picture Archive and Communications Systems (PACS) image management and viewing software. Sightline's, PlasmaSol's and eTrauma's operating results are included in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements from the date of the acquisitions and did not materially impact the Company's operating results. Pro forma consolidated results of operations would not differ significantly as a result of these acquisitions. Additional details, including the financial statement impacts resulting from these acquisitions, are included in Results of Operations. - 28 - In 2005 the Company completed the repatriation of $722 million of foreign earnings under the provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act (the Act). The Act provided a temporary incentive for U.S. companies to repatriate accumulated income earned in foreign jurisdictions at a reduced income tax cost. Additional details, including the financial statement impact resulting from the repatriation of funds, are included in Results of Operations. Outlook for 2008 The Company's outlook for 2008 continues to be optimistic regarding underlying growth rates in orthopaedic procedures and sales growth in the Company's broadly based range of products in orthopaedics and other medical specialties, despite the potential for increased pricing pressure in certain markets. The Company projects that diluted net earnings per share for 2008 will approximate $2.88, representing a 22% increase over diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations of $2.37 for the year ended December 31, 2007. Excluding the impact of the charge to reflect the intangible asset impairment in 2007, as more fully described in Results of Operations, the Company projects that diluted net earnings per share for 2008 will increase 20% over adjusted diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations of $2.40 for the year ended December 31, 2007. The financial forecast for 2008 includes a constant currency net sales increase in the range of 11% to 13% as a result of growth in shipments of Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment. If foreign currency exchange rates hold near December 31, 2007 levels, the Company anticipates a favorable impact on net sales of approximately 2.5% to 3% in the first quarter of 2008 and a favorable impact on net sales of approximately 1% to 1.5% for the full year of 2008. Results of Operations The table below outlines the components of net earnings from continuing operations from the consolidated statements of earnings as a percentage of net sales and the year-to-year percentage change in dollar amounts: Percentage of Net Sales Percentage Change 2007 2006 2005 2007/2006 2006/2005 Net sales 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% 17% 12% Cost of sales 31.1 31.4 32.3 15 9 Gross profit 68.9 68.6 67.7 17 13 Research, development and engineering expenses 6.3 6.3 6.2 16 14 Selling, general and administrative expenses 39.9 39.8 39.9 17 11 Intangibles amortization 0.7 0.8 1.0 (3) (10) Intangible asset impairment 0.3 -- -- -- -- Purchased in-process research and development -- 1.0 0.3 (100) 231 Operating income 21.8 20.7 20.2 23 14 Other income (expense) 1.0 0.6 0.1 108 516 Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes 22.8 21.3 20.3 25 17 Income taxes 6.4 6.3 6.6 19 6 Net earnings from continuing operations 16.4% 15.0% 13.7% 28 22 - 29 - The table below sets forth domestic/international and product line sales information: Net Sales (in millions) Percentage Change 2007 2006 2005 2007/2006 2006/2005 Domestic/international sales: Domestic $3,850.3 $3,298.4 $2,903.0 17% 14% International 2,150.2 1,848.8 1,705.9 16 8 Total net sales $6,000.5 $5,147.2 $4,608.9 17 12 Product line sales: Orthopaedic Implants $3,570.7 $3,110.1 $2,849.5 15 9 MedSurg Equipment 2,429.8 2,037.1 1,759.4 19 16 Total net sales $6,000.5 $5,147.2 $4,608.9 17 12 The tables below set forth additional geographical sales growth information for significant products within the Company's Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment segments on both a reported basis and a constant currency basis: Year Ended December 31, 2007 Percentage Change Domestic International Total Constant Constant Reported Reported Currency Reported Currency Orthopaedic Implants sales: Hips 7 12 5 9 6 Knees 15 16 9 16 13 Trauma 29 12 6 19 15 Spinal 29 16 10 25 23 Craniomaxillofacial 24 6 0 17 14 Total Orthopaedic Implants 16 13 7 15 12 MedSurg Equipment sales: Surgical equipment and surgical navigation systems 17 26 18 20 17 Endoscopic, communications and digital imaging systems 18 30 21 21 19 Patient handling and emergency medical equipment 18 7 3 16 15 Total MedSurg Equipment 18 24 17 19 17 - 30 - Year Ended December 31, 2006 Percentage Change Domestic International Total Constant Constant Reported Reported Currency Reported Currency Orthopaedic Implants sales: Hips 4 0 1 2 2 Knees 16 7 7 12 12 Trauma 23 7 9 13 14 Spinal 20 13 14 18 18 Craniomaxillofacial 24 7 7 16 16 Total Orthopaedic Implants 12 5 6 9 9 MedSurg Equipment sales: Surgical equipment and surgical navigation systems 12 13 13 12 12 Endoscopic, communications and digital imaging systems 16 32 30 19 19 Patient handling and emergency medical equipment 19 14 10 18 17 Total MedSurg Equipment 15 19 18 16 16 2007 Compared with 2006 The Company's net sales increased 17% in 2007 to $6,000.5 million from $5,147.2 million in 2006. Net sales grew by 14% as a result of increased unit volume and changes in product mix and by 3% due to favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company's domestic sales were $3,850.3 million for 2007, representing an increase of 17%, and international sales were $2,150.2 million for 2007, representing an increase of 16%, as a result of higher shipments of Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment. The impact of foreign currency comparisons to the dollar value of international sales was favorable by $131.5 million for 2007. On a constant currency basis, international sales increased 9% in 2007. Worldwide sales of Orthopaedic Implants were $3,570.7 million for 2007, representing an increase of 15% as a result of higher shipments of reconstructive, trauma, spinal and craniomaxillofacial implant systems; bone cement; and the bone growth factor OP-1. On a constant currency basis, sales of Orthopaedic Implants increased 12% in 2007. Hip Implant Systems: Sales of hip implant systems increased 9% during the year (6% on a constant currency basis). In the United States, sales growth was driven by sales of X3 polyethylene and Accolade cementless hip products, partially offset by declines in other hip systems. Solid sales growth in the Exeter, Trident, X3 polyethylene and Accolade hip products in Europe, the Pacific region and the Latin America region also led to the Company's constant currency sales growth for 2007. Knee Implant Systems: Sales of knee implant systems increased 16% during the year (13% on a constant currency basis) due to strong growth in the Triathlon Knee System in the United States, Europe, Canada and the Pacific region and solid growth in the Scorpio Knee System in Europe, the Pacific region and the Latin America region. - 31 - Trauma Implant Systems: Sales of trauma implant systems increased 19% in 2007 (15% on a constant currency basis) as a result of strong sales growth in the Gamma3 Hip Fracture System in the United States, Europe, Canada and the Pacific region as well as solid sales growth in the Company's T2 Nailing System in the United States and Europe, partially offset by a sales decline in Japan as a result of government-imposed price cuts. Spinal Implant Systems: Sales of spinal implant systems increased 25% in 2007 (23% on a constant currency basis). Sales growth for 2007 was driven by strong worldwide sales growth of thoracolumbar implant systems, interbody devices and cervical implants. Craniomaxillofacial Implant Systems: Sales of craniomaxillofacial implant systems increased 17% in 2007 (14% on a constant currency basis) primarily due to strong sales growth of products for neurological indications and craniomaxillofacial implants in the United States, Europe and the Pacific region. Worldwide sales of MedSurg Equipment were $2,429.8 million for 2007, representing an increase of 19% as a result of higher shipments of surgical equipment; surgical navigation systems; endoscopic, communications and digital imaging systems; as well as patient handling and emergency medical equipment. On a constant currency basis, sales of MedSurg Equipment increased 17% in 2007. Surgical Equipment and Surgical Navigation Systems: Sales of surgical equipment and surgical navigation systems increased 20% in 2007 (17% on a constant currency basis) due to strong sales growth in powered surgical and operating room equipment in the United States, Europe and the Pacific region. Solid sales growth in interventional pain products in Europe also led to the Company's constant currency sales growth. Endoscopic, Communications and Digital Imaging Systems: Sales of endoscopic, communications and digital imaging systems increased 21% in 2007 (19% on a constant currency basis) as a result of strong worldwide sales growth of medical video imaging equipment led by the 1188 HD Camera and complementary products such as the X8000 Lightsource and Vision Elect Monitor. Strong sales growth in arthroscopy and communication products in the United States, Europe and the Pacific region also led to the Company's constant currency sales growth. Patient Handling and Emergency Medical Equipment: Sales of patient handling and emergency medical equipment increased 16% in 2007 (15% on a constant currency basis) due to strong sales growth of stretchers and emergency medical equipment in the United States and Europe. In addition, constant currency sales growth in 2007 was led by strong sales growth in hospital beds in the United States as well as strong sales growth in maternity beds in the United States, Canada, Europe and the Latin America region. Cost of sales represented 31.1% of sales in 2007 compared with 31.4% in 2006. The cost of sales percentage in 2007 was favorably impacted by efficiencies gained within manufacturing plants and product distribution channels. Research, development and engineering expenses represented 6.3% of sales for both 2007 and 2006. These expenses increased 16% in 2007 to $375.3 million. The higher spending level is the result of the Company's continued focus on new product development for anticipated future product launches and continued investments in new technologies. New product introductions in 2007 for the Orthopaedic Implants segment included the condylar stabilizing (CS) ultra-congruent insert for the Triathlon Knee System; the Scorpio NRG with X3 advanced bearing technology; and the Omega 3 Compression Hip Screw System. Within the MedSurg Equipment segment, new product introductions in 2007 included InTouch, a high-acuity care bed; the SDC Ultra, an all-in-one medical imaging information management system; the CORE Sumex drill, designed for use in ENT procedures; and the 45L PneumoSure insufflator. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 17% in 2007 and represented 39.9% of sales compared with 39.8% in 2006. The slight increase in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales in 2007 is due to higher sales-related costs, primarily compensation and increased regulatory compliance- - 32 - related costs, partially offset by decreases in insurance costs and slower growth in discretionary spending. In 2007 the Company recorded a $19.8 million charge ($12.7 million net of income taxes) to write off patents associated with intervertebral body fusion cage products. The impairment followed a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) decision to downgrade certain intervertebral body fusion products to class II devices, along with a weak market for sales of these specific products. As a result, the Company performed a discounted cash flow analysis over the remaining life of the patented technologies and determined that the charge was required. The purchased in-process research and development charge of $52.7 million recorded in 2006 relates to the acquisition of Sightline. At the date of the acquisition, the flexible endoscope technologies acquired had not yet reached technological feasibility. The upfront payment of $50.0 million, plus certain transaction costs and the assumption of certain liabilities, was allocated to assets acquired, purchased in-process research and development and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition. The amount written off as purchased in-process research and development was not deductible for income tax purposes in the United States. The Company believes that the technologies acquired in the Sightline acquisition will result in the introduction of new products and additional future sales. However, unanticipated issues may arise that could delay or terminate a product's development prior to commercialization, which could have an unfavorable impact on the Company's operating results. As of December 31, 2007, the Company must refine certain product specifications highlighted during customer preference trials and validate manufacturing processes in order to achieve its plan for initial commercialization of the flexible endoscope technologies in 2008. Interest and marketable securities income, which is included in other income (expense), increased to $85.5 million in 2007 from $41.4 million in 2006 primarily as a result of increased cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities balances in 2007 compared to 2006. Interest expense, which is included in other income (expense), increased to $22.2 million in 2007 from $9.5 million in 2006, primarily as a result of interest expense associated with unresolved income tax positions. The Company's effective income tax rate on earnings from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2007 was 28.0% compared to an effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2006 of 29.5%. The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2007 reflects the impact of the intangible asset impairment charge of $12.7 million (net of $7.1 million income tax benefit). The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2006 reflects the impact of the nondeductibility for income tax purposes of the purchased in-process research and development charge associated with the acquisition of Sightline. After considering these factors, the Company's reported effective income tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 are lower than the U.S. statutory income tax rate primarily as a result of manufacturing in lower income tax international jurisdictions. Upon adoption of FASB Interpretation No. 48, the Company recognized an increase in the interest expense accrual associated with unresolved income tax positions, which was accounted for by reducing the January 1, 2007 balance of retained earnings by $7.6 million (net of income taxes). In addition, the Company reclassified $179.2 million from the current income taxes liability to noncurrent liabilities to match the anticipated timing of future income tax payments. Net earnings from continuing operations increased 28% in 2007 to $986.7 million from $771.4 million in 2006. Basic net earnings per share from continuing operations increased 27% in 2007 to $2.41 from $1.90 in 2006, and diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations increased 27% in 2007 to $2.37 from $1.87 in 2006. Excluding the impacts of the charges to reflect the intangible asset impairment in 2007 and to write off purchased in-process research and development recorded in 2006, adjusted net earnings from continuing operations increased 21% in 2007 to $999.4 million from $824.1 million in 2006. Adjusted basic net earnings per share from continuing operations increased 20% in 2007 to $2.44 from $2.03 in 2006, and adjusted diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations increased 20% in 2007 to $2.40 from $2.00 in 2006. - 33 - The reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures are as follows (in millions, except per share amounts): 2007 2006 Percentage Change Reported net earnings from continuing operations $986.7 $771.4 28% Intangible asset impairment 12.7 -- -- Purchased in-process research and development -- 52.7 (100) Adjusted net earnings from continuing operations $999.4 $824.1 21 Basic net earnings per share of common stock: Reported basic net earnings per share of common stock from continuing operations $2.41 $1.90 27 Intangible asset impairment $.03 -- -- Purchased in-process research and development -- $.13 (100) Adjusted basic net earnings per share of common stock from continuing operations $2.44 $2.03 20 Weighted-average basic shares outstanding 409.7 406.5 Diluted net earnings per share of common stock: Reported diluted net earnings per share of common stock from continuing operations $2.37 $1.87 27 Intangible asset impairment $.03 -- -- Purchased in-process research and development -- $.13 (100) Adjusted diluted net earnings per share of common stock from continuing operations $2.40 $2.00 20 Weighted-average diluted shares outstanding 417.2 411.8 The weighted-average basic and diluted shares outstanding used in the calculation of these non-GAAP financial measures are the same as the weighted-average shares outstanding used in the calculation of the reported per share amounts. The sale of Physiotherapy Associates resulted in a gain on sale of discontinued operations of $25.7 million (net of income taxes), or $.06 per diluted share in 2007. Net earnings from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2007 were $5.0 million, or $.01 per diluted share, compared to net earnings from discontinued operations of $6.3 million, or $.02 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2006. Net earnings increased 31% in 2007 to $1,017.4 million from $777.7 million in 2006. Basic net earnings per share increased 30% in 2007 to $2.48 from $1.91 in 2006, and diluted net earnings per share increased 29% in 2007 to $2.44 from $1.89 in 2006. 2006 Compared with 2005 The Company's net sales increased 12% in 2006 to $5,147.2 million from $4,608.9 million in 2005. Net sales grew by 11% as a result of increased unit volume and changes in product mix and 1% as a result of higher selling prices. Domestic sales were $3,298.4 million for 2006, representing an increase of 14% as a result of higher shipments of Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment. International sales were $1,848.8 million for 2006, representing an increase of 8% as a result of higher shipments of Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment. The impact of foreign currency comparisons to the dollar value of international sales was unfavorable by $5.2 million for 2006. On a constant currency basis, international sales increased 9% in 2006. - 34 - Worldwide sales of Orthopaedic Implants were $3,110.1 million for 2006, representing an increase of 9%, on both a reported and constant currency basis, as a result of higher shipments of reconstructive, trauma, spinal and craniomaxillofacial implant systems; bone cement; and the bone growth factor OP-1. Hip Implant Systems: Sales of hip implant systems increased 2% during the year on both a reported and constant currency basis. In the United States, sales growth was driven by sales of the recently launched X3 polyethylene and increased sales in Accolade cementless hip products and Restoration Modular Hip System revision hip products, partially offset by declines in sales of other hip systems. Solid growth in the Trident Hip System, Accolade cementless hip products and Restoration Modular Hip System revision hip products in Europe as well as solid growth in Accolade cementless hip products and the Trident Hip System in the Pacific region also contributed to the sales growth in hip implant systems. Knee Implant Systems: Sales of knee implant systems increased 12% during the year, on both a reported and constant currency basis, due to strong growth in the Triathlon Knee System in the United States, Europe and the Pacific region and solid growth in the Scorpio Knee System in most international markets, partially offset by slower growth in Japan as a result of government imposed price cuts. Trauma Implant Systems: Sales of trauma implant systems increased 13% during the year (14% on a constant currency basis) due to strong worldwide sales growth in the Gamma3 Hip Fracture System and strong sales growth in the T2 Nailing System in the United States and Europe, partially offset by slower growth in Japan as a result of the price cuts. Spinal Implant Systems: Sales of spinal implant systems increased 18% during the year, on both a reported and constant currency basis, primarily due to strong worldwide sales growth of interbody devices led by sales of the AVS vertebral spacer system as well as solid worldwide sales growth in thoracolumbar products. Craniomaxillofacial Implant Systems: Sales of craniomaxillofacial implant systems increased 16% during the year, on both a reported and constant currency basis, as a result of strong domestic sales growth led by products for neurologic indications and craniomaxillofacial implants. Worldwide sales of MedSurg Equipment were $2,037.1 million for 2006, representing an increase of 16%, on both a reported and constant currency basis, as a result of higher shipments of surgical equipment; surgical navigation systems; endoscopic, communications and digital imaging systems; as well as patient handling and emergency medical equipment. Surgical Equipment and Surgical Navigation Systems: Sales of surgical equipment and surgical navigation systems increased 12% during the year, on both a reported and constant currency basis, due to strong domestic sales growth in surgical navigation systems and operating room equipment and solid domestic sales growth in interventional pain products. Strong sales growth in powered surgical instruments outside the United States also led to the Company's sales growth. Endoscopic, Communications and Digital Imaging Systems: Sales of endoscopic, communications and digital imaging systems increased 19% during the year, on both a reported and constant currency basis, as a result of strong worldwide sales growth in medical video imaging equipment led by the recently launched 1188 HD Camera and related accessories as well as imaging and communications products. Strong worldwide sales growth in general surgery products also contributed to the Company's sales growth. Patient Handling and Emergency Medical Equipment: Sales of patient handling and emergency medical equipment increased 18% during the year (17% on a constant currency basis) due to strong sales growth in hospital bed products in the United States, the Latin America region and Canada, strong domestic sales growth in emergency medical equipment as well as solid stretcher sales growth in Europe and the Latin America region. - 35 - Cost of sales represented 31.4% of sales in 2006 compared with 32.3% in 2005. The lower cost of sales percentage in 2006 is primarily due to lower excess and obsolete inventory costs as a result of fewer comparative product introductions during the year and reduced royalty costs related to the expiration of certain royalty agreements partially offset by faster sales growth in the lower margin MedSurg Equipment segment. Research, development and engineering expenses represented 6.3% of sales in 2006 compared with 6.2% in 2005. These expenses increased 14% in 2006 to $324.6 million. The higher spending level is the result of the Company's continued focus on new product development for anticipated future product launches and continued investments in new technologies. New product introductions in 2006 for the Orthopaedic Implants segment included the LFIT Anatomic Femoral Heads with X3 polyethylene liners, which address range of motion and dislocation potential, and the AVS AS Spacer, which is used for anterior lumbar interbody fusion. Within the MedSurg Equipment segment, new product introductions in 2006 included the 1188 HD Camera and related accessories, the next generation of Stryker 3-Chip HD Cameras, the System 6 heavy duty power system and the Stryker Precision Oscillating Tip Saw, which features a stationary blade shaft with an oscillating tip. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 11% in 2006 and represented 39.8% of sales compared with 39.9% in 2005. The slight decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales in 2006 is due to decreases in insurance costs and slower growth in discretionary spending, partially offset by higher sales-related costs, primarily compensation, loaner instrumentation amortization and sample expenses. The purchased in-process research and development charge of $52.7 million recorded in 2006 relates to the acquisition of Sightline. The purchased in-process research and development charge of $15.9 million recorded in 2005 relates to the acquisition of PlasmaSol. At the date of the PlasmaSol acquisition, the sterilization technology acquired had not yet been approved for sale by the FDA and, therefore, had not yet reached technological feasibility. The purchase price of $17.5 million was allocated to assets acquired, primarily for deferred income tax assets associated with acquired net operating losses, and purchased in-process research and development based on their fair value at the date of acquisition. The amounts written off as purchased in-process research and development were not deductible for income tax purposes in the United States. The Company believes that the technologies acquired in both the Sightline and PlasmaSol acquisitions will result in the introduction of new products and additional future sales. However, unanticipated issues may arise that could delay or terminate a product's development prior to regulatory approval or commercialization, which could have an unfavorable impact on the Company's operating results. As previously described, as of December 31, 2007, the Company must refine certain product specifications highlighted during customer preference trials and validate manufacturing processes in order to achieve its plan for initial commercialization of the flexible endoscope technologies in 2008. As of December 31, 2007, the Company had not encountered significant issues and expects completion of the development and initial commercialization of the sterilization technologies in 2010. Interest and marketable securities income, which is included in other income (expense), increased to $41.4 million in 2006 from $13.3 million in 2005, primarily as a result of increased cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities balances in 2006 compared to 2005. Interest expense, which is included in other income (expense), increased to $9.5 million in 2006 from $7.7 million in 2005, primarily as a result of borrowings in Europe to complete the repatriation of foreign earnings in 2005. The Company's effective income tax rate on earnings from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2006 was 29.5% as compared to an effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2005 of 32.5%. The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2006 reflects the impact of the nondeductibility for income tax purposes of the purchased in-process research and development charge associated with the acquisition of Sightline. The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2005 reflects the impact of the nondeductibility for income tax purposes of the purchased in-process research and development charge associated with the acquisition of PlasmaSol as well as the additional $27.4 million of income taxes recorded as a result of the repatriation of foreign earnings. After considering these factors, the Company's reported effective income tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 are lower than the U.S. statutory income tax rate primarily as a result of manufacturing in lower income tax international jurisdictions. - 36 - Net earnings from continuing operations increased 22% in 2006 to $771.4 million from $632.5 million in 2005. Basic net earnings per share from continuing operations increased 21% in 2006 to $1.90 from $1.57 in 2005, and diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations increased 21% in 2006 to $1.87 from $1.54 in 2005. Excluding the impacts of the charges to write off purchased in-process research and development in 2006 and 2005 and to recognize the income tax expense associated with the repatriation of foreign earnings in 2005, adjusted net earnings from continuing operations increased 22% in 2006 to $824.1 million from $675.8 million in 2005. Adjusted basic net earnings per share from continuing operations increased 22% in 2006 to $2.03 from $1.67 in 2005, and adjusted diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations increased 21% in 2006 to $2.00 from $1.65 in 2005. The reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures are as follows (in millions except per share amounts): 2006 2005 Percentage Change Reported net earnings from continuing operations $771.4 $632.5 22% Purchased in-process research and development 52.7 15.9 231 Income taxes on repatriation of foreign earnings -- 27.4 (100) Adjusted net earnings from continuing operations $824.1 $675.8 22 Basic net earnings per share of common stock: Reported basic net earnings per share of common stock from continuing operations $1.90 $1.57 21 Purchased in-process research and development $.13 $.04 225 Income taxes on repatriation of foreign earnings -- $.07 (100) Adjusted basic net earnings per share of common stock from continuing operations $2.03 $1.67 22 Weighted-average basic shares outstanding 406.5 403.7 Diluted net earnings per share of common stock: Reported diluted net earnings per share of common stock from continuing operations $1.87 $1.54 21 Purchased in-process research and development $.13 $.04 225 Income taxes on repatriation of foreign earnings -- $.07 (100) Adjusted diluted net earnings per share of common stock from continuing operations $2.00 $1.65 21 Weighted-average diluted shares outstanding 411.8 410.8 The weighted-average basic and diluted shares outstanding used in the calculation of these non-GAAP financial measures are the same as the weighted-average shares outstanding used in the calculation of the reported per share amounts. Net earnings from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2006 were $6.3 million, or $.02 per diluted share, compared to net earnings from discontinued operations of $11.1 million, or $.03 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2005. Net earnings increased 21% in 2006 to $777.7 million from $643.6 million in 2005. Basic net earnings per share increased 20% in 2006 to $1.91 from $1.59 in 2005; and diluted net earnings per share increased 20% in 2006 to $1.89 from $1.57 in 2005. - 37 - Liquidity and Capital Resources The Company's working capital at December 31, 2007 increased $1,389.1 million to $3,571.9 million from $2,182.8 million at December 31, 2006. The increase in working capital resulted from growth in the Company's overall business, the proceeds from the sale of Physiotherapy Associates and the use of cash earnings to fund increases in accounts receivable, inventories and prepaid expenses. Accounts receivable days sales outstanding was 56 days at both December 31, 2007 and 2006 and days sales in inventory decreased one day to 137 days at December 31, 2007 from 138 days at December 31, 2006. The Company generated cash of $1,028.3 million from operations in 2007 compared with $867.3 million in 2006. The increase in cash from operations in 2007 compared with the prior year is primarily due to increased earnings partially offset by growth in the working capital accounts, primarily accounts receivable and inventories. In 2007 the Company borrowed an additional $103.7 million and used cash of $102.9 million for payments on borrowings. The Company also used cash of $187.7 million for capital expenditures, including $14.3 million related to the implementation of ERP systems at multiple manufacturing and distribution facilities; $13.9 million for facility expansions; and $7.0 million to complete the construction of the Homer Stryker Center for education and clinical research in Mahwah, New Jersey. In addition, the Company used $54.8 million for acquisitions and $89.7 million for the payment of dividends. The Company also purchased and sold marketable securities, which are classified as available-for-sale investments in accordance with the provisions of FASB Statement No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities. The Company had $290.5 million in cash and cash equivalents and $2,120.3 million in marketable securities at December 31, 2007. The Company also had outstanding borrowings totaling $16.8 million at that date, all of which were classified as current obligations. The Company believes its cash on hand and marketable securities, as well as anticipated cash flows from operations, will be sufficient to fund future operating capital requirements; future manufacturing facility construction and other capital expenditures; future business and product line acquisitions to supplement its current product offerings; loaner instrumentation for surgical implants in support of new product launches; required debt repayments and the payment of dividends. As of December 31, 2007, approximately 9% of the Company's investments in available-for-sale securities were held in triple A rated (per Standard & Poor's) asset-backed debt securities, of which the majority related to investments in automobile loans. At December 31, 2007, less than 1% of the Company's investments in marketable securities were exposed to a risk of loss related to the declining value of the subprime-mortgage securities market. Should additional funds be required, the Company had $1,047.3 million of additional borrowing capacity available under all of its existing credit facilities, including the Company's $1,000.0 million 5-year nonamortizing, revolving Unsecured Credit Facility that expires in November 2010. In addition, the Company had the entire $200.0 million accounts receivable securitization facility available at December 31, 2007. The Company's future contractual obligations for agreements with initial terms greater than 1 year, including agreements to purchase materials in the normal course of business, are summarized as follows (in millions): Payment Period 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Thereafter Long-term debt $ 16.8 $ -- $ -- $ -- $ -- $ -- Operating leases 42.0 34.3 22.2 10.3 6.7 11.7 Unconditional purchase obligations 339.7 69.1 15.1 10.8 10.3 -- Other 4.0 2.8 2.4 2.1 1.6 14.9 Due to uncertainties regarding the ultimate resolution of income tax audits and timing of employee retirements, the Company is not able to reasonably estimate the future periods in which income tax payments to settle these unresolved income tax positions or contributions to fund defined benefits plans will be made. - 38 - The Company's additional borrowing capacity, along with the expected expiration period of the commitments, is summarized as follows (in millions): Amount of Commitment Total Expiration Per Period Amount Less than In excess of Committed 1 year 1 year Unsecured Credit Facility and other lines of credit $1,047.3 $56.4 $990.9 Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Management evaluates these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Estimates are based on historical experience, when available, and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Management believes that of its significant accounting policies (see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), an understanding of the following critical accounting policies is important in obtaining an overall understanding of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses in the collection of accounts receivable. The Company makes estimates regarding the future ability of its customers to make required payments based on historical credit experience and expected future trends. If actual customer financial conditions are less favorable than projected by management, additional accounts receivable write offs may be necessary, which could unfavorably affect future operating results. Inventory Reserves The Company maintains reserves for excess and obsolete inventory resulting from the potential inability to sell its products at prices in excess of current carrying costs. The markets in which the Company operates are highly competitive and new products and surgical procedures are introduced on an ongoing basis. Such marketplace changes may cause some of the Company's products to become obsolete. The Company makes estimates regarding the future recoverability of the costs of these products and records a provision for excess and obsolete inventories based on historical experience, expiration of sterilization dates and expected future trends. If actual product life cycles, product demand or acceptance of new product introductions are less favorable than projected by management, additional inventory write downs may be required, which could unfavorably affect future operating results. Income Taxes The Company operates in multiple income tax jurisdictions both inside and outside the United States. Accordingly, management must determine the appropriate allocation of income to each of these jurisdictions. Income tax audits associated with the allocation of this income and other complex issues, including inventory transfer pricing and product royalty arrangements, may require an extended period of time to resolve and may result in income tax adjustments if changes to the income allocation are required between jurisdictions with different income tax rates. Because income tax adjustments in certain jurisdictions can be significant, the Company records accruals representing management's best estimate of the probable resolution of these matters. - 39 - To the extent additional information becomes available, such accruals are adjusted to reflect the revised estimated probable outcome. Other Matters The Company distributes its products throughout the world. As a result, the Company's financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets. The Company's operating results are primarily exposed to changes in exchange rates among the U.S. dollar, the Japanese yen and European currencies, in particular the euro and the British pound. When the U.S. dollar weakens against foreign currencies, the dollar value of sales denominated in foreign currencies increases. When the U.S. dollar strengthens, the opposite situation occurs. The Company manufactures its products in the United States, France, Germany, Ireland, Switzerland, Canada and Puerto Rico and incurs the costs to manufacture in the applicable local currencies. This worldwide deployment of factories serves to partially mitigate the impact of currency exchange rate changes on the Company's cost of sales. The Company enters into forward currency exchange contracts to mitigate the impact of currency fluctuations on transactions denominated in nonfunctional currencies, thereby limiting risk to the Company that would otherwise result from changes in exchange rates. These nonfunctional currency exposures principally relate to intercompany receivables and payables arising from intercompany purchases of manufactured products. The periods of the forward currency exchange contracts correspond to the periods of the exposed transactions, with realized gains and losses included in the measurement and recording of transactions denominated in the nonfunctional currencies. All forward currency exchange contracts are marked to market each period, with resulting gains (losses) included in other income (expense) in the consolidated statements of earnings. At December 31, 2007, the Company had outstanding forward currency exchange contracts to purchase $427.9 million and sell $257.7 million of various currencies (principally U.S. dollars and euros) with maturities ranging principally from 4 to 101 days. At December 31, 2006, the Company had outstanding forward currency exchange contracts to purchase $387.9 million and sell $227.0 million of various currencies (principally U.S. dollars and euros) with maturities ranging principally from 7 to 180 days. The estimated fair value of forward currency exchange contracts represents the measurement of the contracts at month-end spot rates as adjusted by current forward points. A hypothetical 10% change in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar would change the December 31, 2007 fair value by approximately $7.4 million. The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties on its outstanding forward currency exchange contracts but does not anticipate nonperformance by any of the counterparties. The Company has certain investments in net assets in international locations that are not hedged. These investments are subject to translation gains and losses due to changes in foreign currencies. For the year ended December 31, 2007, the strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar increased the value of these investments in net assets, and the related deferred gain in shareholders' equity, by $152.7 million to $272.3 million from $119.6 million at December 31, 2006. The Company is partially self-insured for product liability claims and utilizes a wholly owned captive insurance company in the United States to manage its self-insured retention limits. The captive insurance company provides insurance reserves for estimated liabilities for product claims incurred but not reported based on actuarially determined liabilities. The actuarial valuations are based on historical information along with certain assumptions about future events. In 2003 the Company announced that it received a subpoena from the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Massachusetts in connection with a U.S. Department of Justice investigation of Physiotherapy Associates' billing and coding practices. Under the terms of the Physiotherapy sale agreement, Stryker retained responsibility for certain cash damages to be paid in connection with this investigation. The Company's liability for such damages was fixed under the sale agreement, with interest to be accrued through the date of payment, which occurred in 2007. Liabilities previously recorded by the Company were sufficient to cover these obligations. - 40 - In 2007 the Company disclosed that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has made an informal inquiry of the Company regarding possible violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in connection with the sale of medical devices in certain foreign countries. Subsequently, in 2008, the Company received a subpoena from the U.S. Department of Justice, Criminal Division, requesting certain documents for the period January 1, 2000 through the present in connection with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry. In 2006 the Company announced that it received a subpoena from the U.S. Department of Justice, Antitrust Division, requesting documents for the period January 2001 through the present regarding possible violations of federal criminal law, including possible violation of the antitrust laws, relating to the manufacture and sale of orthopaedic implant devices. The Company is fully cooperating with the U.S. Department of Justice and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission regarding these matters. In 2007 the Company received two warning letters from the FDA regarding compliance with certain quality system specifications at its reconstructive implant manufacturing facilities: one letter for its facility in Cork, Ireland and another for its facility in Mahwah, New Jersey. The Company takes these matters very seriously and has been fully cooperating with the FDA to address their observations. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk are included in the Results of Operations and Other Matters sections of the Company's Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition on pages 29 through 37 and 40 through 41, respectively. - 41 -",2023-12-30 18:43:02.191321
310764,SYK,STRYKER CORP,2009,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. Throughout this discussion, references are made to the following financial measures: ""constant currency,"" ""adjusted net earnings from continuing operations,"" ""adjusted basic net earnings per share from continuing operations"" and ""adjusted diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations."" These financial measures are an alternative representation of Stryker Corporation's (the Company or Stryker) past and potential future operational performance and do not replace the presentation of the Company's reported financial results under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The Company has provided these supplemental non-GAAP financial measures because they provide meaningful information regarding the Company's results on a consistent and comparable basis for the periods presented. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures for reviewing the operating results of its business segments, for analyzing potential future business trends in connection with its budget process and bases certain annual bonus plans on these non-GAAP financial measures. In order to measure the Company's sales performance on a constant currency basis, it is necessary to remove the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates which affects the comparability and trend of sales. Constant currency results are calculated by translating current year results at prior year average foreign currency exchange rates. In order to measure earnings performance on a consistent and comparable basis, the Company excludes the restructuring charges recorded in 2008, the intangible asset impairment charge recorded in 2007 and the purchased in-process research and development charge recorded in 2006, each of which affects the comparability of operating results and the trend of earnings. Additional details regarding the nature, determination and financial statement impact of these items are included in Results of Operations. In addition, the Company believes investors will utilize this information to evaluate period-to-period results on a comparable basis and to better understand potential future operating results. The Company encourages investors and other users of these financial statements to review its Consolidated Financial Statements and other publicly filed reports in their entirety and not to rely solely on any single financial measure. Executive Level Overview Stryker is one of the world's leading medical technology companies with the most broadly based range of products in orthopaedics and a significant presence in other medical specialties. Stryker works with respected medical professionals to help people lead more active and more satisfying lives. The Company's products include implants used in joint replacement, trauma, craniomaxillofacial and spinal surgeries; biologics; surgical, neurologic, ear, nose & throat and interventional pain equipment; endoscopic, surgical navigation, communications and digital imaging systems; as well as patient handling and emergency medical equipment. Domestic sales accounted for 64% of total revenues in 2008. Most of the Company's products are marketed directly to doctors, hospitals and other healthcare facilities by approximately 3,900 sales and marketing personnel in the United States. Stryker primarily maintains separate and dedicated sales forces for each of its principal product lines to provide focus and a high level of expertise to each medical specialty served. International sales accounted for 36% of total revenues in 2008. The Company's products are sold in more than 100 countries through Company-owned sales subsidiaries and branches as well as third-party dealers and distributors. The Company's business is generally not seasonal in nature; however, the number of orthopaedic implant surgeries is lower during the summer months. During the fourth quarter of 2008, the general economic slowdown in the United States resulted in a significant and rapid contraction in hospital capital budgets that depressed demand for certain MedSurg Equipment products. The unprecedented weakening of the economy caused the Company's hospital customers to reduce capital purchases to a degree not previously experienced in prior recessionary periods. - 28 - During 2008 the Company repurchased 17.4 million shares of common stock in the open market at a cost of $1,000.0 million pursuant to the repurchase programs authorized by the Company's Board of Directors. Shares repurchased under the share repurchase programs are available for general corporate purposes, including offsetting dilution associated with stock option and other equity-based employee benefit plans. In 2008 the Company decided to simplify the structure of its Japanese distribution business and to substantially reduce development efforts associated with the product technologies acquired from Sightline Technologies Ltd. (Sightline). In 2006 the Company acquired all of the outstanding stock of Sightline, a private, development-stage company, for an upfront payment of $50.0 million in cash plus certain transaction costs and the assumption of certain liabilities. Terms of the transaction also included milestone payments of up to an additional $90.0 million upon the achievement of certain operational and financial targets related to Sightline's products. Unanticipated issues have arisen that continue to delay the regulatory approval and commercialization efforts of new products associated with the product technologies acquired in the Sightline acquisition. However, the Company believes that the technologies acquired in the Sightline acquisition may result in the introduction of new products and additional sales in future periods. Additional details, including the financial statement impact resulting from these restructurings and the acquisition of Sightline, are included in Results of Operations. In 2008 the Company adopted the provisions of Financial Accounting Standard Board (FASB) Statement No. 157, Fair Value Measurements, for financial assets and liabilities measured on a recurring basis. This Statement applies to all financial assets and financial liabilities that are being measured and reported on a fair value basis, establishes a framework for measuring fair value of assets and liabilities and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. There was no impact to the Consolidated Financial Statements as a result of the adoption of this Statement. The additional disclosure requirements regarding fair value measurements are included in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In 2008 the Company adopted the provisions of FASB Statement No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. This Statement allows companies the option to measure eligible financial instruments at fair value. Such election, which may be applied on an instrument by instrument basis, is typically irrevocable once elected. The Company has elected to apply the fair value option to its Auction Rate Securities Rights agreement, as more fully described in Liquidity and Capital Resources. In 2007 the Company sold its outpatient physical therapy business, Physiotherapy Associates, for $150.0 million in cash less certain indebtedness. Physiotherapy Associates' operating results are reported as discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006. Additional details, including the financial statement impact resulting from this divestiture, are included in Results of Operations. In 2007 the Company adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes. This Interpretation clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing the minimum recognition threshold an income tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. The Interpretation also provides guidance for the measurement and classification of income tax positions, interest and penalties, and requires additional disclosure on an annual basis. Additional details, including the financial statement impact resulting from this adoption, are included in Results of Operations. Outlook for 2009 The Company continues to face depressed demand for certain MedSurg Equipment products due to the general economic slowdown. In addition, the Company anticipates that a slowdown in elective procedures for certain of its Orthopaedic Implants products may occur. The Company projects that diluted net earnings per share for 2009 will be in the range of $3.12 to $3.22, an increase of 10% to 14% over adjusted diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations of $2.83 in 2008. The financial forecast for 2009 anticipates a constant currency net sales increase in the range of 6% to 9%. If foreign currency exchange rates hold near January 31, 2009 levels, the Company anticipates an unfavorable impact on net sales of approximately 4.0% to 4.5% in the first quarter of 2009 and an unfavorable impact on net sales of approximately 3.5% to 4.5% for the full year of 2009. - 29 - Results of Operations The table below outlines the components of net earnings from continuing operations from the Consolidated Statements of Earnings as a percentage of net sales and the year-to-year percentage change in dollar amounts: Percentage of Net Sales Percentage Change 2008 2007 2006 2008/2007 2007/2006 Net sales 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% 12% 17% Cost of sales 31.7 31.1 31.4 14 15 Gross profit 68.3 68.9 68.6 11 17 Research, development and engineering expenses 5.5 6.3 6.3 (2) 16 Selling, general and administrative expenses 39.1 39.9 39.8 10 17 Intangibles amortization 0.6 0.7 0.8 (3) (3) Restructuring charges 0.5 - - - - Intangible asset impairment - 0.3 - (100) - Purchased in-process research and development - - 1.0 - (100) Operating income 22.6 21.8 20.7 16 23 Other income (expense) 0.9 1.0 0.6 (3) 108 Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes 23.5 22.8 21.3 15 25 Income taxes 6.4 6.4 6.3 13 19 Net earnings from continuing operations 17.1% 16.4% 15.0% 16 28 The Company segregates its operations into two reportable business segments: Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment. The Orthopaedic Implants segment sells orthopaedic reconstructive (hip, knee and shoulder), trauma, craniomaxillofacial and spinal implant systems; bone cement; and the bone growth factor OP-1. The MedSurg Equipment segment sells surgical equipment; surgical navigation systems; endoscopic, communications and digital imaging systems; as well as patient handling and emergency medical equipment.

Net sales grew by 11% as a result of increased unit volume and changes in product mix and by 1% due to favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company's domestic sales were $4,282.2 million for 2008, representing an increase of 11%, as a result of higher shipments of Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment. International sales were $2,436.0 million for 2008, representing an increase of 13%. The impact of foreign currency comparisons to the dollar value of international sales was favorable by $84.7 million for 2008. On a constant currency basis, international sales increased 9% in 2008 as a result of higher shipments of Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment. - 31 - Worldwide sales of Orthopaedic Implants were $3,967.5 million for 2008, representing an increase of 11%. On a constant currency basis, sales of Orthopaedic Implants increased 9% in 2008 as a result of higher shipments of reconstructive, trauma, spinal and craniomaxillofacial implant systems and bone cement. Hip Implant Systems: Sales of hip implant systems increased 3% in 2008 (1% on a constant currency basis). In the United States, sales growth was driven by increased sales of the Cormet Hip Resurfacing product and sales growth in X3 Polyethylene and Accolade cementless hip products, partially offset by declines in other hip systems. Sales growth in several hip systems, including Accolade, X3 Polyethylene and ABG II, in Europe and Secur-Fit in Japan and the Pacific region also contributed to the Company's constant currency sales growth in 2008. Knee Implant Systems: Sales of knee implant systems increased 14% in 2008 (13% on a constant currency basis) due to strong sales growth in the Triathlon Knee System in the United States, Europe, Canada and the Pacific region and solid sales growth in the Scorpio Knee System in Japan and the Latin America region. Trauma Implant Systems: Sales of trauma implant systems increased 18% in 2008 (14% on a constant currency basis) as a result of strong worldwide sales growth in the Gamma3 Hip Fracture System and the SPS Calcaneal Foot Plating System and strong sales growth in the Company's T2 Nailing System in the United States, Canada and the Pacific region. Strong sales growth in the HydroSet injectable bone substitute product in the United States and the Pacific region also contributed to the Company's constant currency sales growth in 2008. Spinal Implant Systems: Sales of spinal implant systems increased 19% in 2008 (18% on a constant currency basis). The increase was driven by strong worldwide sales growth of thoracolumbar implant systems, interbody devices and cervical implants. Craniomaxillofacial Implant Systems: Sales of craniomaxillofacial implant systems increased 16% in 2008 (15% on a constant currency basis) primarily due to strong sales growth of products for neurological indications and craniomaxillofacial implants and the HydroSet injectable bone substitute product in the United States and the Pacific region. Worldwide sales of MedSurg Equipment were $2,750.7 million for 2008, representing an increase of 14%. On a constant currency basis, sales of MedSurg Equipment increased 13% in 2008 as a result of higher shipments of surgical equipment and surgical navigation systems; endoscopic, communications and digital imaging systems; as well as patient handling and emergency medical equipment. Surgical Equipment and Surgical Navigation Systems: Sales of surgical equipment and surgical navigation systems increased 17% in 2008 (15% on a constant currency basis) due to strong worldwide sales growth in powered surgical and operating room equipment as well as solid sales growth in interventional pain products in the United States and the Pacific region. Endoscopic, Communications and Digital Imaging Systems: Sales of endoscopic, communications and digital imaging systems increased 9% in 2008 (8% on a constant currency basis) as a result of strong worldwide sales growth in arthroscopy and general surgery as well as strong international sales growth of medical video imaging equipment, led by the 1188 HD camera and complimentary products, partially offset by lower sales of medical video imaging equipment in the United States. Strong sales growth in communication products, led by the SwitchPoint Infinity 2, in the United States and Canada also contributed to the Company's constant currency sales growth. Patient Handling and Emergency Medical Equipment: Sales of patient handling and emergency medical equipment increased 18% in 2008 (17% on a constant currency basis) due to strong sales growth of hospital bed products in the United States and the Latin America region and stretchers and emergency medical equipment in the United States and Europe. - 32 - Cost of sales represented 31.7% of sales in 2008 compared with 31.1% in 2007. The increase in the cost of sales percentage is primarily due to increased compliance initiative spending and higher commodity and freight costs. Research, development and engineering expenses represented 5.5% of sales in 2008 compared with 6.3% in 2007. As anticipated, the spending level in 2008 decreased by 2% to $367.8 million as the Company implemented a more normalized level of spending for these costs compared to prior periods as well as the Company's focus of research and development resources on compliance initiatives, which has slowed down some research and development projects and reduced outside contractor spending on certain projects. New product introductions in 2008 for the Orthopaedic Implants segment included the Tritanium Primary Hip System; the Triathlon TS Revision Knee System; the Triathlon Partial Knee Resurfacing System; the Asnis Screw System; the VariAx Hand and Foot Trauma Systems; and the Xia III Thoracolumbar Spinal System. Within the MedSurg Equipment segment, new product introductions in 2008 included the S3 Med/Surg Hospital Bed and the Neptune 2 Waste Management System. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 10% in 2008 and represented 39.1% of sales compared with 39.9% in 2007. The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales in 2008 is due to tight control of discretionary spending in the second half of 2008 partially offset by increases in sales-related costs and costs associated with compliance activities. In 2008 the Company recorded $34.9 million ($21.7 million net of income taxes) in restructuring charges related to the decisions to simplify the structure of the Company's Japanese distribution business and to substantially reduce development efforts associated with Sightline product technologies acquired in 2006. In 2007 the Company recorded a $19.8 million charge ($12.7 million net of income taxes) to write off patents associated with intervertebral body fusion cage products. The impairment followed a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) decision to downgrade certain intervertebral body fusion products to class II devices, along with a weak market for sales of these specific products. As a result, the Company performed a discounted cash flow analysis over the remaining life of the patented technologies and determined that the charge was required. Interest and marketable securities income, which is included in other income (expense), increased to $97.7 million in 2008 from $85.5 million in 2007 primarily as a result of increased average cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities balances in 2008 compared to 2007. Interest expense, which is included in other income (expense), increased to $30.5 million in 2008 from $22.2 million in 2007, primarily as a result of interest expense associated with unresolved income tax positions. The Company's effective income tax rate on earnings from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2008 was 27.4% compared to an effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2007 of 28.0%. The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2008 reflects the impact of the restructuring charges of $21.7 million (net of $13.2 million income tax benefits). The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2007 reflects the impact of the intangible asset impairment charge of $12.7 million (net of $7.1 million income tax benefit). In addition to these factors, the Company's reported effective income tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 are lower than the U.S. statutory income tax rate primarily as a result of manufacturing in lower income tax jurisdictions. Net earnings from continuing operations increased 16% in 2008 to $1,147.8 million from $986.7 million in 2007. Basic net earnings per share from continuing operations increased 17% in 2008 to $2.81 from $2.41 in 2007, and diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations increased 17% in 2008 to $2.78 from $2.37 in 2007. Excluding the impact of the restructuring charges recorded in 2008 and the charge to reflect the intangible asset impairment in 2007, adjusted net earnings from continuing operations increased 17% in 2008 to $1,169.5 million from $999.4 million in 2007. Adjusted basic net earnings per share from continuing operations increased 18% in 2008 to $2.87 from $2.44 in 2007, and adjusted diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations increased 18% in 2008 to $2.83 from $2.40 in 2007. - 33 - The reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures are as follows (in millions, except per share amounts): Percentage 2008 2007 Change Reported net earnings from continuing operations $1,147.8 $986.7 16 Restructuring charges 21.7 - - Intangible asset impairment - 12.7 (100) Adjusted net earnings from continuing operations $1,169.5 $999.4 17 Basic net earnings per share of common stock from continuing operations: Reported basic net earnings per share from continuing operations $2.81 $2.41 17 Restructuring charges $0.05 - - Intangible asset impairment - $0.03 (100) Adjusted basic net earnings per share from continuing operations $2.87 $2.44 18 Weighted-average basic shares outstanding 408.1 409.7 Diluted net earnings per share of common stock from continuing operations: Reported diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations $2.78 $2.37 17 Restructuring charges $0.05 - - Intangible asset impairment - $0.03 (100) Adjusted diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations $2.83 $2.40 18 Weighted-average diluted shares outstanding 413.6 417.2 The weighted-average basic and diluted shares outstanding used in the calculation of these non-GAAP financial measures are the same as the weighted-average shares outstanding used in the calculation of the reported per share amounts. Net earnings for the year ended December 31, 2007 included a gain of $25.7 million (net of income taxes), or $0.06 per diluted share, to reflect the divestiture of the Company's outpatient physical therapy business, Physiotherapy Associates, and net earnings from discontinued operations of $5.0 million, or $0.01 per diluted share. Net earnings increased 13% in 2008 to $1,147.8 million from $1,017.4 million in 2007. Basic net earnings per share increased 13% in 2008 to $2.81 from $2.48 in 2007, and diluted net earnings per share increased 14% in 2008 to $2.78 from $2.44 in 2007. 2007 Compared with 2006 The Company's net sales increased 17% in 2007 to $6,000.5 million from $5,147.2 million in 2006. Net sales grew by 14% as a result of increased unit volume and changes in product mix and by 3% due to favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company's domestic sales were $3,850.3 million for 2007, representing an increase of 17% as a result of higher shipments of Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment. International sales were $2,150.2 million for 2007, representing an increase of 16%. The impact of foreign currency comparisons to the dollar value of international sales was favorable by $131.5 million for 2007. On a constant currency basis, international sales increased 9% in 2007 as a result of higher shipments of Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment. Worldwide sales of Orthopaedic Implants were $3,587.3 million for 2007, representing an increase of 15%. On a constant currency basis, sales of Orthopaedic Implants increased 12% in 2007 as a result of higher shipments of reconstructive, trauma, spinal and craniomaxillofacial implant systems; bone cement; and the bone growth factor OP-1. - 34 - Hip Implant Systems: Sales of hip implant systems increased 9% in 2007 (6% on a constant currency basis). In the United States, sales growth was driven by sales of X3 polyethylene and Accolade cementless hip products, partially offset by declines in other hip systems. Solid sales growth in the Exeter, Trident, X3 polyethylene and Accolade hip products in Europe, the Pacific region and the Latin America region also contributed to the Company's constant currency sales growth for 2007. Knee Implant Systems: Sales of knee implant systems increased 16% in 2007 (13% on a constant currency basis) due to strong sales growth in the Triathlon Knee System in the United States, Europe, Canada and the Pacific region and solid sales growth in the Scorpio Knee System in Europe, the Pacific region and the Latin America region. Trauma Implant Systems: Sales of trauma implant systems increased 19% in 2007 (15% on a constant currency basis) as a result of strong sales growth in the Gamma3 Hip Fracture System in the United States, Europe, Canada and the Pacific region as well as solid sales growth in the Company's T2 Nailing System in the United States and Europe, partially offset by a sales decline in Japan as a result of government-imposed price cuts. Spinal Implant Systems: Sales of spinal implant systems increased 25% in 2007 (23% on a constant currency basis). The increase was driven by strong worldwide sales growth of thoracolumbar implant systems, interbody devices and cervical implants. Craniomaxillofacial Implant Systems: Sales of craniomaxillofacial implant systems increased 17% in 2007 (14% on a constant currency basis) primarily due to strong sales growth of products for neurological indications and craniomaxillofacial implants in the United States, Europe and the Pacific region. Worldwide sales of MedSurg Equipment were $2,413.2 million for 2007, representing an increase of 19%. On a constant currency basis, sales of MedSurg Equipment increased 17% in 2007 as a result of higher shipments of surgical equipment; surgical navigation systems; endoscopic, communications and digital imaging systems; as well as patient handling and emergency medical equipment. Surgical Equipment and Surgical Navigation Systems: Sales of surgical equipment and surgical navigation systems increased 20% in 2007 (17% on a constant currency basis) due to strong sales growth in powered surgical and operating room equipment in the United States, Europe and the Pacific region. Solid sales growth in interventional pain products in Europe also contributed to the Company's constant currency sales growth. Endoscopic, Communications and Digital Imaging Systems: Sales of endoscopic, communications and digital imaging systems increased 21% in 2007 (19% on a constant currency basis) as a result of strong worldwide sales growth of medical video imaging equipment led by the 1188 HD Camera and complementary products such as the X8000 Lightsource and Vision Elect Monitor. Strong sales growth in arthroscopy and communication products in the United States, Europe and the Pacific region also contributed to the Company's constant currency sales growth. Patient Handling and Emergency Medical Equipment: Sales of patient handling and emergency medical equipment increased 16% in 2007 (15% on a constant currency basis) due to strong sales growth of stretchers and emergency medical equipment in the United States and Europe. In addition, constant currency sales growth was aided by strong sales growth in hospital beds in the United States as well as strong sales growth in maternity beds in the United States, Canada, Europe and the Latin America region. Cost of sales represented 31.1% of sales in 2007 compared with 31.4% in 2006. The cost of sales percentage in 2007 was favorably impacted by efficiencies gained within manufacturing plants and product distribution channels. - 35 - Research, development and engineering expenses represented 6.3% of sales for both 2007 and 2006. These expenses increased 16% in 2007 to $375.3 million. The higher spending level was the result of the Company's continued focus on new product development for anticipated future product launches and continued investments in new technologies. New product introductions in 2007 for the Orthopaedic Implants segment included the condylar stabilizing (CS) ultra-congruent insert for the Triathlon Knee System; the Scorpio NRG with X3 advanced bearing technology; and the Omega3 Compression Hip Screw System. Within the MedSurg Equipment segment, new product introductions in 2007 included InTouch, a high-acuity care bed; the SDC Ultra, an all-in-one medical imaging information management system; the CORE Sumex drill, designed for use in ENT procedures; and the 45L PneumoSure insufflator. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 17% in 2007 and represented 39.9% of sales compared with 39.8% in 2006. The slight increase in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales in 2007 was due to higher sales-related costs, primarily compensation and increased regulatory compliance-related costs, partially offset by decreases in insurance costs and slower growth in discretionary spending. As previously described, in 2007 the Company recorded a $19.8 million charge ($12.7 million net of income taxes) to write off patents associated with intervertebral body fusion cage products. The purchased in-process research and development charge of $52.7 million recorded in 2006 related to the acquisition of Sightline. At the date of the acquisition, the flexible endoscope technologies acquired had not yet reached technological feasibility. The upfront payment of $50.0 million, plus certain transaction costs and the assumption of certain liabilities, was allocated to assets acquired, purchased in-process research and development and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition. The amount written off as purchased in-process research and development was not deductible for income tax purposes in the United States. Interest and marketable securities income, which is included in other income (expense), increased to $85.5 million in 2007 from $41.4 million in 2006 primarily as a result of increased cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities balances in 2007 compared to 2006. Interest expense, which is included in other income (expense), increased to $22.2 million in 2007 from $9.5 million in 2006, primarily as a result of interest expense associated with unresolved income tax positions. The Company's effective income tax rate on earnings from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2007 was 28.0% compared to an effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2006 of 29.5%. The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2007 reflects the impact of the intangible asset impairment charge of $12.7 million (net of $7.1 million income tax benefit). The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2006 reflects the impact of the nondeductibility for income tax purposes of the purchased in-process research and development charge associated with the acquisition of Sightline. In addition to these factors, the Company's reported effective income tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 are lower than the U.S. statutory income tax rate primarily as a result of manufacturing in lower income tax jurisdictions. Upon adoption of FASB Interpretation No. 48, the Company recognized an increase in the interest expense accrual associated with unresolved income tax positions, which was accounted for by reducing the January 1, 2007 balance of retained earnings by $7.6 million (net of income taxes). In addition, the Company reclassified $179.2 million from the current income taxes liability to noncurrent liabilities to match the anticipated timing of future income tax payments. Net earnings from continuing operations increased 28% in 2007 to $986.7 million from $771.4 million in 2006. Basic net earnings per share from continuing operations increased 27% in 2007 to $2.41 from $1.90 in 2006, and diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations increased 27% in 2007 to $2.37 from $1.87 in 2006. - 36 - Excluding the impact of the charges to reflect the intangible asset impairment in 2007 and to write off purchased in-process research and development recorded in 2006, adjusted net earnings from continuing operations increased 21% in 2007 to $999.4 million from $824.1 million in 2006. Adjusted basic net earnings per share from continuing operations increased 20% in 2007 to $2.44 from $2.03 in 2006, and adjusted diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations increased 20% in 2007 to $2.40 from $2.00 in 2006. The reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures are as follows (in millions except per share amounts): Percentage 2007 2006 Change Reported net earnings from continuing operations $986.7 $771.4 28 Intangible asset impairment 12.7 - -- Purchased in-process research and development - 52.7 (100) Adjusted net earnings from continuing operations $999.4 $824.1 21 Basic net earnings per share of common stock: Reported basic net earnings per share from continuing operations $2.41 $1.90 27 Intangible asset impairment $0.03 - -- Purchased in-process research and development - $0.13 (100) Adjusted basic net earnings per share from continuing operations $2.44 $2.03 20 Weighted-average basic shares outstanding 409.7 406.5 Diluted net earnings per share of common stock: Reported diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations $2.37 $1.87 27 Intangible asset impairment $0.03 - -- Purchased in-process research and development - $0.13 (100) Adjusted diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations $2.40 $2.00 20 Weighted-average diluted shares outstanding 417.2 411.8 The weighted-average basic and diluted shares outstanding used in the calculation of these non-GAAP financial measures are the same as the weighted-average shares outstanding used in the calculation of the reported per share amounts. The sale of Physiotherapy Associates resulted in a gain on sale of discontinued operations of $25.7 million (net of income taxes), or $0.06 per diluted share in 2007. Net earnings from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2007 were $5.0 million, or $0.01 per diluted share and net earnings from discontinued operations were $6.3 million, or $0.02 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2006. Net earnings increased 31% in 2007 to $1,017.4 million from $777.7 million in 2006. Basic net earnings per share increased 30% in 2007 to $2.48 from $1.91 in 2006, and diluted net earnings per share increased 29% in 2007 to $2.44 from $1.89 in 2006. Liquidity and Capital Resources The Company's working capital at December 31, 2008 decreased $54.7 million to $3,517.2 million from $3,571.9 million at December 31, 2007. The decrease in working capital resulted from the use of cash to complete the $1,000.0 million share repurchase programs partially offset by increases in accounts receivable, inventories and prepaid expenses. The decrease in working capital is also due to the reclassification of certain marketable securities from current assets to non-current assets within the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2008, as more fully described below. Accounts receivable days sales outstanding was 59 days at December 31, 2008 and 56 days at December 31, 2007. Days sales in inventory increased by 18 days to 155 days at December 31, 2008 from 137 days at December 31, 2007 in support of recent and future anticipated product launches. - 37 - The Company generated cash of $1,175.9 million from operations in 2008 compared with $1,028.3 million in 2007. The increase in cash from operations in 2008 is primarily due to increased earnings partially offset by increased inventory levels. In 2008 the Company used cash of $155.2 million for capital expenditures, including $33.2 million for facility expansions. In addition, the Company used cash of $135.6 million for the payment of dividends and $1,000.0 million of cash to repurchase 17.4 million shares of common stock. The Company also purchased and sold marketable securities, which are classified as available-for-sale investments in accordance with the provisions of FASB Statement No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, and related interpretations. The Company had $701.1 million in cash and cash equivalents and $1,494.5 million in current marketable securities at December 31, 2008. The Company had outstanding borrowings totaling $20.5 million at that date, all of which were classified as current obligations. The Company believes its cash on hand and marketable securities, as well as anticipated cash flows from operations, will be sufficient to fund future operating capital requirements; future manufacturing facility construction and other capital expenditures; future business and product line acquisitions to supplement its current product offerings; loaner instrumentation for surgical implants in support of new product launches; required debt repayments and the payment of dividends. Should additional funds be required, the Company had $1,079.4 million of additional borrowing capacity available under all of its existing credit facilities, including the Company's $1,000.0 million 5-year nonamortizing, revolving Unsecured Credit Facility that expires in November 2010. In addition, the Company had the entire $100.0 million accounts receivable securitization facility available at December 31, 2008. The Company's additional borrowing capacity, along with the expected expiration period of the commitments, is summarized as follows (in millions): Amount of Commitment Total Expiration Per Period Amount Less Than In Excess Committed 1 Year of 1 Year Unsecured Credit Facility and other lines of credit $1,079.4 $0.2 $1,079.2 The Company reviews declines in the fair value of its investments classified as available-for-sale for impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 115 in order to determine whether the decline in fair value is an other-than-temporary impairment. Other-than-temporary impairments of available-for-sale marketable securities are recorded in earnings. The primary factors considered by the Company to recognize declines in the fair value of its investments as other-than-temporary impairments are the intent and ability of the Company to retain its investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value, the length of time and the extent to which the market value of the investment has been less than cost and the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer based on publicly available financial information. Beginning in February 2008, liquidity issues in the global credit markets resulted in the failure of auctions for all of the auction-rate securities (ARS) investments held by the Company, as the amount of securities submitted for sale in those auctions exceeded the amount of purchase bids. To date the Company has collected all interest receivable on outstanding ARS when due and expects to continue to do so in the future. Due to current market conditions the ARS investments have continued to experience failed auctions. These failed auctions result in a lack of liquidity in the securities but do not affect the underlying collateral of the securities. The Company does not anticipate that the lack of liquidity in its ARS, even for an extended period of time, will affect its ability to finance its operations, including its expansion programs and planned capital expenditures. The Company continues to monitor efforts by the financial markets to find alternative means for restoring the liquidity of these investments. These investments will be classified as non-current assets until liquidity is restored in the market. - 38 - As of December 31, 2008, the Company held $166.8 million, at par value, of ARS investments. In 2008 the Company entered into an ARS Rights agreement (Rights) with UBS Financial Services Inc. (UBS), one of its investment providers, whereby the Company received the right to sell its ARS at par value to UBS at any time during the period June 30, 2010 through July 2, 2012. These Rights are nontransferable securities registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. As a result of accepting the Rights, the Company has released UBS and its employees/agents from all claims except claims for consequential damages directly or indirectly relating to UBS's marketing and sale of ARS and agreed not to serve as a class representative or receive benefits under any class action settlement or investor fund. The Company elected to measure the value of the Rights under the fair value option of FASB Statement No. 159, and recorded a gain of $28.0 million in other income (expense), and a corresponding non-current asset. Simultaneously, the Company transferred its ARS investments, at their fair value of $138.8 million, from available-for-sale to trading marketable securities. As a result of this transfer, the Company recognized a loss of $28.0 million in other income (expense), reflecting a reversal of the related temporary valuation allowance that was previously recorded within accumulated other comprehensive gain (loss) in shareholders' equity. The Company anticipates that any future changes in the fair value of the Rights will be offset by the changes in the fair value of the related ARS, both of which will be adjusted to their estimated fair value on an ongoing basis. The Company's future contractual obligations for agreements with initial terms greater than 1 year, including agreements to purchase materials in the normal course of business, are summarized as follows (in millions): Payment Period 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 After 2013 Total Long-term debt $20.5 $ - $ - $ - $ - $ - $20.5 Operating leases 47.7 37.7 26.5 15.7 12.2 27.1 166.9 Unconditional purchase obligations 475.6 40.2 24.5 13.0 2.0 12.6 567.9 Contribution to defined benefits plans 21.5 - - - - - 21.5 Other 2.0 2.3 2.0 1.5 1.5 12.6 21.9 $567.3 $80.2 $53.0 $30.2 $15.7 $52.3 $798.7 As further described in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, as of December 31, 2008, the Company's defined benefit pension plans are in an underfunded status of $101.6 million. Due to the rules affecting tax-deductible contributions in the jurisdictions in which the plans are offered and the impact of future plan asset performance, changes in interest rates and the potential for changes in legislation in the United States and other foreign jurisdictions, the Company is not able to reasonably estimate the future periods, beyond 2009, in which contributions to fund defined benefit pension plans will be made. As further described in Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, as of December 31, 2008, the Company has recorded a liability for unresolved income tax positions of $277.1 million. Due to uncertainties regarding the ultimate resolution of income tax audits, the Company is not able to reasonably estimate the amount or the future periods in which income tax payments to settle these unresolved income tax positions will be made. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Management evaluates these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Estimates are based on historical experience, when available, and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. - 39 - Management believes that, of its significant accounting policies (see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), an understanding of the following critical accounting policies is important in obtaining an overall understanding of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses in the collection of accounts receivable. The Company makes estimates regarding the future ability of its customers to make required payments based on historical credit experience and expected future trends. If actual customer financial conditions are less favorable than projected by management, additional accounts receivable write offs may be necessary, which could unfavorably affect future operating results. Inventory Reserves The Company maintains reserves for excess and obsolete inventory resulting from the potential inability to sell its products at prices in excess of current carrying costs. The markets in which the Company operates are highly competitive and new products and surgical procedures are introduced on an ongoing basis. Such marketplace changes may cause some of the Company's products to become obsolete. The Company makes estimates regarding the future recoverability of the costs of these products and records a provision for excess and obsolete inventories based on historical experience, expiration of sterilization dates and expected future trends. If actual product life cycles, product demand or acceptance of new product introductions are less favorable than projected by management, additional inventory write downs may be required, which could unfavorably affect future operating results. Income Taxes The Company operates in multiple income tax jurisdictions both inside and outside the United States. Accordingly, management must determine the appropriate allocation of income to each of these jurisdictions. Income tax audits associated with the allocation of this income and other complex issues, including inventory transfer pricing and cost sharing and product royalty arrangements, may require an extended period of time to resolve and may result in income tax adjustments if changes to the income allocation are required between jurisdictions with different income tax rates. Because income tax adjustments in certain jurisdictions can be significant, the Company records accruals representing management's best estimate of the probable resolution of these matters. To the extent additional information becomes available, such accruals are adjusted to reflect the revised estimated probable outcome. Other Matters The Company distributes its products throughout the world. As a result, the Company's financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as weak economic conditions or changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company's operating results are primarily exposed to changes in exchange rates among the U.S. dollar, European currencies, in particular the euro and the British pound, the Japanese yen, the Australian dollar and the Canadian dollar. When the U.S. dollar weakens against foreign currencies, the dollar value of sales denominated in foreign currencies increases. When the U.S. dollar strengthens, the opposite situation occurs. The Company manufactures its products in the United States, France, Germany, Ireland, Switzerland, Canada and Puerto Rico and incurs the costs to manufacture in the applicable local currencies. This worldwide deployment of factories serves to partially mitigate the impact of currency exchange rate changes on the Company's cost of sales. The Company enters into forward currency exchange contracts to mitigate the impact of currency fluctuations on transactions denominated in nonfunctional currencies, thereby limiting risk to the Company that would otherwise result from changes in exchange rates. These nonfunctional currency exposures principally relate to intercompany receivables and payables arising from intercompany purchases of manufactured products. The periods of the forward currency exchange contracts correspond to the periods of the exposed transactions, with realized gains and losses included in the measurement and recording of transactions denominated in the - 40 - nonfunctional currencies. All forward currency exchange contracts are recorded at their fair value each period, with resulting gains (losses) included in other income (expense) in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. At December 31, 2008, the Company had outstanding forward currency exchange contracts to purchase $412.5 million and sell $288.4 million of various currencies (principally U.S. dollars and euros) with maturities ranging from 2 to 110 days. At December 31, 2007, the Company had outstanding forward currency exchange contracts to purchase $427.9 million and sell $257.7 million of various currencies (principally U.S. dollars and euros) with maturities ranging from 4 to 101 days. The estimated fair value of forward currency exchange contracts represents the measurement of the contracts at month-end spot rates as adjusted by current forward points. A hypothetical 10% change in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar would change the December 31, 2008 fair value by approximately $20.7 million. The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties on its outstanding forward currency exchange contracts but does not anticipate nonperformance by any of the counterparties. The Company has certain investments in net assets in international locations that are not hedged. These investments are subject to translation gains and losses due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. For the year ended December 31, 2008, the weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar decreased the value of these investments in net assets, and the related foreign currency translation adjustment gain in shareholders' equity, by $68.6 million to $203.7 million from $272.3 million at December 31, 2007. The Company is partially self-insured for product liability claims and utilizes a wholly owned captive insurance company in the United States to manage its self-insured retention limits. The captive insurance company provides insurance reserves for estimated liabilities for product claims incurred but not reported based on actuarially determined liabilities. The actuarial valuations are based on historical information along with certain assumptions about future events. In 2008 the Company and certain current and former employees received subpoenas from the U.S. Department of Justice Office, Criminal Division, of the United States Attorney in Massachusetts requesting documents related to (i) false Institutional Review Board approvals; (ii) the amount of sales of OP-1 under one of the Company's Humanitarian Device Exemptions; and (iii) the off-label promotion of Calstrux in combination with OP-1. The Company is in the process of responding to the U.S. Department of Justice regarding this matter. In 2008 the Company received a warning letter from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) related to quality systems and compliance issues at its OP-1 implant manufacturing facility in Hopkinton, Massachusetts. In 2007 the Company received two warning letters from the FDA regarding compliance with certain quality system specifications at its reconstructive implant manufacturing facilities: one letter for its facility in Cork, Ireland and another for its facility in Mahwah, New Jersey. The Company takes these matters very seriously and has been fully cooperating with the FDA to address their observations. In 2007 the Company announced that it reached a resolution with the U.S. Attorney's office for the District of New Jersey in connection with a previously announced investigation relating to ""any and all consulting contracts, professional service agreements, or remuneration agreements between Stryker Corporation and any orthopedic surgeon, orthopedic surgeon in training, or medical school graduate using or considering the surgical use of hip or knee joint replacement/reconstruction products manufactured or sold by Stryker Corporation."" The resolution is in the form of a non-prosecution agreement for an 18-month period ending on March 27, 2009. During the term of the agreement, the Company's Orthopaedics subsidiary is subject to oversight by a federal monitor, as appointed by the U.S. Attorney, regarding compliance with certain standards and procedures in connection with the retention and payment of orthopaedic surgeon consultants related to reconstructive products and the provision of certain benefits to such surgeons. Subsequent to entering into the non-prosecution agreement, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Inspector General (HHS) issued a civil subpoena to the Company in seeking to determine whether the Company violated various laws by paying consulting fees and providing other things of value to orthopedic surgeons and healthcare and educational institutions as inducements to use Stryker's orthopedic medical devices in procedures paid for in whole or in part by Medicare. The Company produced numerous documents and other materials to HHS in response to the subpoena and had been working with HHS to attempt to narrow the scope of the requested production. In 2008 - 41 - the U.S. Department of Justice and HHS sought judicial enforcement of the subpoena and a court agreed to enforce it in January 2009. At the same time, the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey dismissed the Company's complaint which had asked the court to quash the subpoena and sought other appropriate relief on the grounds that the subpoena was overbroad and oppressive. In 2007 the Company disclosed that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission made an informal inquiry of the Company regarding possible violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in connection with the sale of medical devices in certain foreign countries. Subsequently, in 2008, the Company received a subpoena from the U.S. Department of Justice, Criminal Division, requesting certain documents for the period since January 1, 2000 in connection with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry. The Company is fully cooperating with the U.S. Department of Justice and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission regarding these matters. In 2006 the Company announced that it received a subpoena from the U.S. Department of Justice, Antitrust Division, requesting documents for the period since January 2001 regarding possible violations of federal criminal law, including possible violation of the antitrust laws, relating to the manufacture and sale of orthopaedic implant devices. In 2008 the Company was advised by the U.S. Department of Justice, Antitrust Division, that the Department had closed its grand jury investigation of antitrust and related offenses in the orthopaedic implants industry. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk are included in the Results of Operations, Liquidity and Capital Resources and Other Matters sections of the Company's Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition on pages 30 through 42. - 42 -",2023-12-30 18:43:04.824631
310764,SYK,STRYKER CORP,2012,"ITEM 7.MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.We supplement the reporting of our financial information determined under GAAP with certain non-GAAP financial measures, including percentage sales growth in constant currency, adjusted net earnings and adjusted diluted net earnings per share. We believe that these non-GAAP measures provide meaningful information to assist shareholders in understanding our financial results and assessing our prospects for future performance. Management believes percentage sales growth in constant currency, adjusted net earnings and adjusted net earnings per diluted share are important indicators of our operations because they exclude items that may not be indicative of or are unrelated to our core operating results and provide a baseline for analyzing trends in our underlying businesses. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures for reviewing the operating results of reportable business segments, for analyzing potential future business trends in connection with our budget process and bases certain annual bonus plans on these non-GAAP financial measures. To measure percentage sales growth in constant currency, we remove the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates that affect the comparability and trend of sales. Percentage sales growth in constant currency is calculated by translating current year results at prior year average foreign currency exchange rates. To measure earnings performance on a consistent and comparable basis, we exclude certain items that affect the comparability of operating results and the trend of earnings. Because non-GAAP financial measures are not standardized, it may not be possible to compare these financial measures with other companies' non-GAAP financial measures having the same or similar names. These adjusted financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for reported sales growth, net earnings and diluted net earnings per share, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are an additional way of viewing aspects of our operations that, when viewed with our GAAP results and the reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures at the end of the discussion of Results of Operations below, provide a more complete understanding of our business. We strongly encourage investors and shareholders to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure.ABOUT STRYKERStryker is one of the world's leading medical technology companies, with 2011 revenues of $8,307 and net earnings of $1,345. We are dedicated to helping healthcare professionals perform their jobs more efficiently while enhancing patient care. We offer a diverse array of innovative medical technologies, including reconstructive, medical and surgical, and neurotechnology and spine products, to help people lead more active and more satisfying lives. In 2011 we began segregating our reporting into three reportable business segments: Reconstructive, MedSurg, and Neurotechnology and Spine. See Note 13 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.Recent Business DevelopmentsIn January 2012 we reached a settlement regarding a 2009 indictment charging Stryker Biotech LLC and certain then-current employees and a former employee of Stryker Biotech with wire fraud, conspiracy to defraud the FDA, distribution of a misbranded device and false statements to the FDA. We reached a settlement with the United States Attorney's Office for the District of Massachusetts, under which Stryker pled to one misdemeanor charge and paid a non-tax deductible fine of $15. As a result of this resolution, the Department of Justice dismissed all thirteen felony charges against Stryker Biotech contained in the 2009 federal grand jury indictment. All of the charges against the then-current and former employees of Stryker Biotech have also been dismissed. The settlement represented a recognized subsequent event and accordingly was recorded in our fourth quarter 2011 results.In 2011 we recorded $38 in severance and related costs in connection with focused reductions of our global workforce and other restructuring activities that are expected to reduce our global workforce by approximately 5% by the end of 2012. The targeted reductions and other restructuring activities are being initiated to provide efficiencies and realign resources in advance of the new Medical Device Excise Tax scheduled to begin in 2013, as well as to allow for continued investment in strategic areas and drive growth. In addition, we recorded $25 in intangible asset impairments and $13 in contractual and other obligations, as certain of our restructuring actions resulted in the discontinued use of specific assets and the exit of certain lease and other commitments.In 2011 we recorded an income tax benefit related to a favorable settlement with the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) regarding its proposed adjustment to our previously filed 2003 through 2007 income tax returns related to income tax positions we had taken with respect to our cost sharing arrangements with two wholly owned entities operating in Ireland, and we recorded charges for other uncertain tax positions related to the outcome of the IRS settlements. The net benefit of these adjustments for uncertain tax positions was $99 (net of tax).In October 2011 we acquired Concentric Medical, Inc. (Concentric), which manufactures and markets minimally invasive products for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke, in an all cash transaction for $135. The acquisition of Concentric enhances our product offerings within our Neurotechnology and Spine segment.In July 2011 we completed the acquisition of Memometal Technologies (Memometal) in an all cash transaction for $150, including the assumption of $9 in debt, as well as an additional $12 to be paid upon the completion of certain milestones. The acquisition of 9 Dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.Memometal enhances our product offerings within our Reconstructive segment.In June 2011 we completed the acquisition of Orthovita, Inc. (Orthovita) in an all cash transaction for $316. The acquisition of Orthovita complements our existing product offerings, primarily within our Neurotechnology and Spine business segment. In February 2011 we completed the previously announced sale of our OP-1 product family for use in orthopaedic bone applications and our manufacturing facility based in West Lebanon, NH for total consideration of $60.In January 2011 we completed the previously announced acquisition of assets of the Neurovascular division of Boston Scientific Corporation (Neurovascular) in an all cash transaction for $1,450, with an additional $50 payment to be made upon completion of certain milestones. The acquisition of Neurovascular substantially enhances our presence in the neurotechnology market, allowing us to offer a comprehensive portfolio of products in both neurosurgical and neurovascular devices. In September 2011 we sold $750 of senior unsecured notes due September 2016 and in January 2010 we sold $500 of senior unsecured notes due January 15, 2015 and $500 of senior unsecured notes due January 15, 2020. The net proceeds from the offerings have been and will continue to be available for working capital and other general corporate purposes, including acquisitions, stock repurchases and other business opportunities.

In 2011, net sales grew by 6.1% as a result of increased unit volume and changes in product mix, 2.4% due to the favorable impact of foreign currency and 6.8% due to acquisitions, which were partially offset by an unfavorable impact of 1.8% due to changes in price. In 2010, net sales grew by 6.9% as a result of increased unit volume and changes in product mix, 1.0% due to the favorable impact of foreign currency and 2.6% due to acquisitions, which were partially offset by an unfavorable impact of 1.7% due to changes in price.In the United States, net sales increased 9.9% in 2011, after increasing 11.0% in 2010. In constant currency, international sales increased 13.4% in 2011, compared to 2.2% in 2010. In 2011 acquisitions contributed $496 or 6.8% to net sales, compared to $177 or 2.6% in 2010. The remaining increases in 2011 and 2010 were primarily due to higher United States shipments of Medsurg products and higher international shipments of MedSurg products and Neurotechnology and Spine products.The following geographical sales growth information by segment is provided to supplement the net sales information presented above:10 Dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.

The increase in units sold was due to higher industry demand. In addition, net sales were negatively impacted by the unfavorable impact of changes in price, which were partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign currency. In constant currency Reconstructive net sales increased by 1.5% in 2011. Reconstructive net sales for 2010 increased 4.9% from 2009, primarily due to increases in unit volumes for Hips, Knees, and Trauma and Extremities products, due to higher worldwide industry demand. In constant currency Reconstructive net sales increased by 3.5% in 2010.MedSurg net sales in 2011 increased 12.7% from 2010, led by Medical while Endoscopy and Instruments also increased, primarily due to a 9.5% increase in unit volume and changes in product mix, the favorable impact of foreign currency and acquisitions. In constant currency MedSurg net sales increased by 11.2% in 2011. MedSurg net sales in 2010 increased 15.5% from 2009, led by increases in Medical as well as increases in Endoscopy and Instruments. Net sales in 2010 were positively impacted by 7.1% from acquisitions; the remainder is due to increases in unit volume from higher worldwide demand. In constant currency MedSurg net sales increased by 14.7% in 2010.Neurotechnology and Spine net sales in 2011 increased 48.5% from 2010, primarily due to the acquisition of Neurovascular; sales growth from acquisitions was 42.6%. The remainder of the increase included 6.3% due to increases in unit volume and changes in product mix and the favorable impact of foreign currency, which were partially offset by an unfavorable impact of changes in price. In constant currency Neurotechnology and Spine net sales in 2011 increased by 46.4%. Neurotechnology and Spine net sales in 2010 increased 6.1% from 2009, primarily due to increases in unit volumes in both Spine and Neurotechnology product lines, from higher worldwide demand. In constant currency Neurotechnology and Spine net sales in 2010 increased by 5.6%. Consolidated Cost of SalesCost of sales increased 23.0% from 2010 to 33.8% of sales compared to 31.2% in 2010. Cost of sales in 2011 includes an additional cost of $143 ($97 net of taxes) related to inventory that was stepped up to fair value following the acquisitions of Neurovascular, 11 Dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.Orthovita, Memometal and Concentric. The remaining increase in the cost of sales percentage was primarily due to the impact of lower pricing on sales resulting in an increase in cost of sales as a percent of sales and the impact of changes in product mix and of a weaker United States dollar on purchases from international manufacturing operations. Cost of sales in 2010 decreased 4.7% from 2009 to 31.2% of sales compared to 32.5% in 2009. The decrease in the cost of sales percentage was primarily due to lower excess and obsolete inventory charges, higher absorption due to higher production levels as well as a favorable impact from the effect of foreign currency on costs from our euro-based manufacturing sites.Research, Development and Engineering ExpensesResearch, development and engineering expenses represented 5.6% of sales in 2011 compared to 5.4% in 2010 and 5.0% in 2009. The higher spending levels are the result of our focus on new product development for anticipated future product launches and continued investments in new technologies. Selling, General and Administrative ExpensesSelling, general and administrative expenses in 2011 increased 16.4% and represented 37.9% of sales compared to 37.0% in 2010 and 37.3% in 2009. In 2011 we recorded $66 ($45 net of taxes) in transaction and acquisition costs and integration-related charges associated with the acquisitions of the Neurovascular, Orthovita, Memometal and Concentric businesses. In addition, in 2011 general and administrative expenses include the payment of an intellectual property infringement claim, offset by a favorable resolution of a value added tax issue. In 2010 we sold a manufacturing facility in France and recorded a gain of $24 ($13 net of taxes), which is included in general and administrative expenses. In 2009 we settled an outstanding patent infringement lawsuit and received $62 ($43 net of taxes) pursuant to a legal agreement. Restructuring ChargesIn 2011 we recorded $76 ($60 net of taxes) in restructuring charges related to focused reductions of our global workforce and other restructuring, expected to reduce our global workforce by approximately 5% and be substantially complete by the end of 2012 at a total cost of approximately $150 to $175. The actions were initiated in 2011 to provide efficiencies and realign resources in advance of the new Medical Device Excise Tax scheduled to begin in 2013, as well as to allow for continued investment in strategic areas and drive growth. In 2009 we recorded $67 ($49 net of taxes) in restructuring charges related to agency conversion charges associated with the termination of certain third-party agent agreements, asset impairment charges related primarily to identifiable intangible assets as a result of our decision to discontinue selling certain products, severance and related costs resulting from our decision to simplify the organization structure at our Biotech, EMEA, Japan and Canada divisions and contractual obligations and other charges in connection with the termination of various supplier contracts as well as other incidental costs related to the discontinued product lines. Property, plant and equipment impairmentIn 2010 we recorded a $124 ($76 net of taxes) non-cash impairment charge to reduce the carrying amount of certain assets to fair value related to our OP-1 product family and related manufacturing facility.Other Income (Expense)Other expense in 2011 decreased $22 from 2010, primarily due to reductions of accrued interest expense resulting from settlements reached with the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS). We reached a favorable settlement regarding an IRS proposed adjustment to our previously filed 2003 through 2007 income tax returns, related to the income tax positions we had taken for our Irish cost sharing arrangements. We also reached a settlement with the IRS with respect to the allocation of income with a wholly owned subsidiary operating in Puerto Rico for the years 2006 through 2009. The positive effect on interest expense from these tax settlements helped offset lower average yields on our investments combined with lower cash and cash equivalent and marketable securities balances compared to 2010. The decrease in these balances and the corresponding reduction in interest and investment income was primarily due to the purchases of the Neurovascular, Orthovita, Memometal and Concentric businesses, which were funded with cash. Other expense in 2010 increased $52 from 2009 primarily due to lower average yields on our investments combined with higher interest cost on the debt issued in January 2010.Income TaxesOur effective income tax rate on earnings was 20.2%, 26.4% and 31.8% in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The effective income tax rate for 2011 includes the net impact of the settlement with the IRS of income allocation issues with a wholly owned subsidiary operating in Puerto Rico and our Irish cost sharing arrangements, effective settlement of all United States federal tax matters for tax years 2003 through 2007 and charges for other uncertain income tax positions. The effective income tax rate for 2010 includes the impact of the property, plant and equipment impairment charge, the gain on sale of a manufacturing facility and the favorable income tax expense adjustment associated with the repatriation of foreign earnings to the United States completed in 2009. The effective income tax rate for 2009 includes the impact of restructuring charges, the patent litigation gain and the impact of the income tax expenses associated with the repatriation of foreign earnings.12 Dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.Net EarningsNet earnings in 2011 increased 5.7% from 2010 to $1,345. Basic net earnings per share in 2011 increased 8.4% from 2010 to $3.48, and diluted net earnings per share in 2011 increased 8.2% from 2010 to $3.45. Net earnings in 2010 increased 15.0% from 2009 to $1,273. Basic net earnings per share in 2010 increased 15.0% to $3.21 as compared to $2.79 in 2009, and diluted net earnings per share in 2010 increased 15.0% to $3.19 as compared to $2.77 in 2009.Reported net earnings includes benefits from settlements and other adjustments related to uncertain tax positions, restructuring and related charges and acquisition and integration related charges related to the Neurovascular, Orthovita, Memometal and Concentric acquisitions, including transaction costs, integration related costs and additional cost of sales for inventory sold in the year that was “stepped up” to fair value. Excluding the impact of these items, adjusted net earnings in 2011 increased 9.0% to $1,448 after increasing 12.6% in 2010. Adjusted diluted net earnings per share in 2011 increased 11.7% to $3.72 after increasing 12.9% in 2010. The following reconciles the non-GAAP financial measures adjusted net earnings and adjusted diluted net earnings per share with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, reported net earnings and diluted net earnings per share: 2011 2010 2009Reported net earnings$1,345 $1,273 $1,107Acquisition and integration-related charges: Cost of sales - inventory step-up97 — — Selling, general and administrative expenses - acquisition and integration-related charges45 — —Restructuring charges60 — 49Uncertain income tax position adjustments(99) — —Gain on sale of property, plant and equipment— (13) —Income taxes on repatriation of foreign earnings— (7) 67Impairment of property, plant and equipment— 76 —Patent litigation gain— — (43)Adjusted net earnings$1,448 $1,329 $1,180 2011 2010 2009Diluted net earnings per share of common stock: Reported diluted net earnings per share$3.45 $3.19 $2.77Acquisition and integration-related charges: Cost of sales - inventory set-up0.25 — —Selling, general and administrative expenses - acquisition and integration-related charges0.12 — —Restructuring charges0.16 — 0.12Uncertain income tax position adjustments(0.26) — —Gain on sale of property, plant and equipment— (0.03) —Income taxes on repatriation of foreign earnings— (0.02) 0.17Impairment of property, plant and equipment— 0.19 —Patent litigation gain— — (0.11)Adjusted diluted net earnings per share$3.72 $3.33 $2.95Weighted-average diluted shares outstanding389.5 399.5 399.4The weighted-average basic and diluted shares outstanding used in the calculation of our non-GAAP financial measures are the same as the weighted-average shares outstanding used in the calculation of our reported per share amounts.FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITYOperating ActivitiesOperating cash flow was $1,434 in 2011, a decrease of 7.3% from 2010. Operating cash flow resulted primarily from net earnings adjusted for non-cash items (depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, sale of inventory stepped-up to fair value at acquisition and deferred income taxes), partially offset by an increase in working capital. The net of accounts receivable, inventory, loaner instrumentation and accounts payable consumed $498 of operating cash flow in 2011. Inventory consumed $166 of operating cash flow primarily due to the building of inventory related to acquisitions and other business growth, increased stock levels in advance of new product introductions and higher inventory levels in support of anticipated 2012 sales growth. Inventory days on hand increased by 4 days due to the impact of the above. Accounts receivable used $143, primarily due to the building of accounts receivable related to acquisitions and other business growth. Accounts receivable days sales outstanding increased by 2 days due to 13 Dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.timing of sales.Operating cash flow was $1,547 in 2010, a 6% increase from 2009. Operating cash flow resulted primarily from net earnings adjusted for non-cash items (depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, sale of inventory stepped-up to fair value at acquisition, property, plant and equipment impairment, deferred income taxes and gain on sale of property, plant and equipment), partially offset by an increase in working capital. The net of accounts receivable, inventory, loaner instrumentation and accounts payable consumed $349 of operating cash flow in 2010 primarily due to increases in inventories and accounts receivable. Inventory consumed $131 of operating cash flow driven by higher inventory levels in support of anticipated 2011 sales growth. Inventory days on hand increased by 9 days due to the impact of foreign exchange and higher inventory levels. Accounts receivable used $121 primarily to support business growth. Accounts receivable days sales outstanding of 56 were unchanged from the prior year. Investing Activities Net investing activities consumed $2,135 of cash in 2011 and $795 of cash in 2010, primarily due to acquisitions and capital spending, partially offset by proceeds from the sale of assets.Acquisitions. Acquisitions used $2,066 of cash in 2011 primarily for the acquisitions of Neurovascular for $1,450; Orthovita for $316; Memometal for $150; and Concentric for $135. In 2010 acquisitions used $265 of cash primarily for the acquisitions of the Sonopet Ultrasonic Aspirator control consoles, handpieces and accessories, Gaymar Industries, Inc. and the bioimplantable implants product line and related assets from Porex Surgical, Inc.Capital Spending. We manage capital spending to support our business growth. Capital expenditures, primarily to support capacity expansion, new product introductions, innovation and cost savings, were $226 in 2011 and $182 in 2010.Proceeds from Asset Sales. Proceeds from asset sales contributed $67 to cash in 2011, primarily due to the sale of certain assets related to the OP-1 product family. In 2010 proceeds from asset sales contributed $61 to cash, primarily due to the sale of a manufacturing facility in France.Financing ActivitiesDividend Payments. Dividends paid per common share increased 20.0% to $0.72 per share in 2011. Total dividend payments to common shareholders were $279 in 2011 and $238 in 2010. The increase in dividend payments resulted from increases in our quarterly dividend from $0.15 per share in 2010 to $0.18 per share in 2011.Long-Term and Short-Term Debt. We maintain debt levels we consider appropriate after evaluating a number of factors, including cash flow expectations, cash requirements for ongoing operations, investment and financing plans (including acquisitions and share repurchase activities) and overall cost of capital. In September 2011 we sold $750 of senior unsecured notes due September 2016 and in January 2010 we sold $500 of senior unsecured notes due January 15, 2015 and $500 of senior unsecured notes due January 15, 2020. The net proceeds from the offerings have been and will continue to be available for working capital and other general corporate purposes, including acquisitions, stock repurchases and other business opportunities. Total debt was $1,768 in 2011 and $1,021 in 2010. Share Repurchases. The total use of cash for share repurchases was $622 in 2011 and $426 in 2010.LiquidityOur cash and marketable securities were $3,418 at December 31, 2011 and $4,380 at December 31, 2010 and our current assets exceeded current liabilities by $5,383 at December 31, 2011 and $6,027 at December 31, 2010. We anticipate being able to support our short-term liquidity and operating needs largely through cash generated from operations. We have funded, and may continue from time to time to fund, ourselves in the capital markets. We have strong short- and long-term debt ratings that we believe should enable us to refinance our debt as it becomes due. In addition, we have a $1,000 credit facility with a diverse group of financial institutions that, if needed, should provide sufficient funding to meet short-term financing requirements. We had approximately $1,098 of borrowing capacity available under all of our existing credit facilities at December 31, 2011. At December 31, 2011, approximately 62% of our consolidated cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities were held in locations outside of the United States. These funds are considered indefinitely reinvested to be used to expand operations either organically or through acquisitions outside the United States. We do not intend to repatriate any significant amounts of cash in the foreseeable future.Guarantees and Other Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsWe do not have guarantees or other off-balance sheet financing arrangements, including variable interest entities, of a magnitude that we believe could have a material impact on our financial condition or liquidity.14 Dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND FORWARD-LOOKING CASH REQUIREMENTSAs further described in Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, as of December 31, 2011 our defined benefit pension plans were in an underfunded status of $106, of which approximately $94 related to plans outside the United States. Due to the rules affecting tax-deductible contributions in the jurisdictions in which the plans are offered and the impact of future plan asset performance, changes in interest rates and the potential for changes in legislation in the United States and other foreign jurisdictions, we are not able to reasonably estimate the future periods, beyond 2012, in which contributions to fund defined benefit pension plans will be made. As further described in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, as of December 31, 2011, we have recorded a liability for uncertain income tax positions of $249. Due to uncertainties regarding the ultimate resolution of income tax audits, we are not able to reasonably estimate the future periods in which income tax payments to settle these uncertain income tax positions will be made.Our future contractual obligations for agreements with initial terms greater than one year, including agreements to purchase materials in the normal course of business, are: Payment Period 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 After 2016 TotalShort-term and Long-term debt$17 $— $— $500 $— $1,251 $1,768Unconditional purchase obligations518 135 127 100 8 2 890Operating leases57 46 32 27 22 44 228Contributions to defined benefit plans22 — — — — — 22Other6 2 2 2 1 40 53 $620 $183 $161 $629 $31 $1,337 $2,961CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATESIn preparing our financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, there are certain accounting policies that may require a choice between acceptable accounting methods or may require substantial judgment or estimation in their application. These include allowance for doubtful accounts, inventory reserves, income taxes, acquisitions, goodwill and intangible assets, and legal and other contingencies. We believe these accounting policies, and others set forth in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, should be reviewed as they are integral to understanding our results of operations and financial condition. Allowance for Doubtful AccountsWe maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses in the collection of accounts receivable. We make estimates regarding the future ability of our customers to make required payments based on historical credit experience and expected future trends. If actual customer financial conditions are less favorable than projected by management, additional accounts receivable write offs may be necessary, which could unfavorably affect future operating results.Inventory ReservesWe maintain reserves for excess and obsolete inventory resulting from the potential inability to sell certain products at prices in excess of current carrying costs. We make estimates regarding the future recoverability of the costs of these products and record provisions based on historical experience, expiration of sterilization dates and expected future trends. If actual product life cycles, product demand or acceptance of new product introductions are less favorable than projected by management, additional inventory write downs may be required, which could unfavorably affect future operating results.Income TaxesOur annual tax rate is determined based on our income, statutory tax rates and the tax impacts of items treated differently for tax purposes than for financial reporting purposes. Tax law requires certain items be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return, and some differences are temporary, reversing over time, such as depreciation expense. These temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent the tax effect of items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in our income statement. Deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in our financial statements for which payment has been deferred, the tax effect of expenditures for which a deduction has already been taken in our tax return but has not yet been recognized in our financial statements or assets recorded at fair value in business combinations for which there was no corresponding tax basis adjustment. Inherent in determining our annual tax rate are judgments regarding business plans, tax planning opportunities and expectations about future outcomes. Realization of certain deferred tax assets is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income in the appropriate 15 Dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.jurisdiction prior to the expiration of the carryforward periods. Although realization is not assured, management believes it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances, will be realized. We operate in multiple jurisdictions with complex tax policy and regulatory environments. In certain of these jurisdictions, we may take tax positions that management believes are supportable, but are potentially subject to successful challenge by the applicable taxing authority. These differences of interpretation with the respective governmental taxing authorities can be impacted by the local economic and fiscal environment. We evaluate our tax positions and establish liabilities in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance on uncertainty in income taxes. We review these tax uncertainties in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of tax audits, and adjust them accordingly. We have a number of audits in process in various jurisdictions. Although the resolution of these tax positions is uncertain, based on currently available information, we believe that it is more likely than not that the ultimate outcomes will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Because there are a number of estimates and assumptions inherent in calculating the various components of our tax provision, certain changes or future events such as changes in tax legislation, geographic mix of earnings, completion of tax audits or earnings repatriation plans could have an impact on those estimates and our effective tax rate.Acquisitions, Goodwill and IntangiblesWe account for acquired businesses using the purchase method of accounting. Under the purchase method, our Consolidated Financial Statements include the operations of an acquired business starting from the completion of the acquisition. In addition, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed must be recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective estimated fair values, with any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired recorded as goodwill. Significant judgment is required in estimating the fair value of intangible assets and in assigning their respective useful lives. Accordingly, we typically obtain the assistance of third-party valuation specialists for significant items. The fair value estimates are based on available historical information and on future expectations and assumptions deemed reasonable by management, but are inherently uncertain. We typically use an income method to estimate the fair value of intangible assets, which is based on forecasts of the expected future cash flows attributable to the respective assets. Significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the valuations reflect a consideration of other marketplace participants and include the amount and timing of future cash flows (including expected growth rates and profitability), the underlying product or technology life cycles, the economic barriers to entry and the discount rate applied to the cash flows. Unanticipated market or macroeconomic events and circumstances may occur that could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and assumptions. Determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment. Certain intangibles are expected to have indefinite lives based on their history and our plans to continue to support and build the acquired brands. Other acquired intangible assets (e.g., certain trademarks or brands, customer relationships, patents and technologies) are expected to have determinable useful lives. Our assessment as to trademarks and brands that have an indefinite life and those that have a determinable life is based on a number of factors including competitive environment, market share, trademark and/or brand history, underlying product life cycles, operating plans and the macroeconomic environment of the countries in which the trademarks or brands are sold. Our estimates of the useful lives of determinable-lived intangibles are primarily based on these same factors. All of our acquired technology and customer-related intangibles are expected to have determinable useful lives. The costs of determinable-lived intangibles are amortized to expense over their estimated life. The value of indefinite-lived intangible assets and residual goodwill is not amortized but is tested at least annually for impairment. Our impairment testing for goodwill is performed separately from our impairment testing of indefinite-lived intangibles. We perform our annual impairment test for goodwill in the fourth quarter of each year. We have early-adopted the provisions of Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2011-08, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other: Testing Goodwill for Impairment, which permits us to consider qualitative indicators of the fair value of a reporting unit when it is unlikely that a reporting unit has impaired goodwill. In certain circumstances, we may also utilize a discounted cash flow analysis that requires certain assumptions and estimates be made regarding market conditions and our future profitability. In those circumstances we test goodwill for impairment by reviewing the book value compared to the fair value at the reporting unit level. We test individual indefinite-lived intangibles by reviewing the individual book values compared to the fair value. We determine the fair value of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets based on the income approach. Under the income approach, we calculate the fair value of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. Considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating and macroeconomic changes and to estimate future cash flows to measure fair value. Assumptions used in our impairment evaluations, such as forecasted growth rates and cost of capital, are consistent with internal projections and operating plans. We believe such assumptions and estimates are also comparable to those that would be used by other marketplace participants. When certain events or changes in operating conditions occur, indefinite-lived intangible assets may be reclassified to a determinable life asset and an additional impairment assessment may be performed. 16 Dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.We did not recognize any material impairment charges for goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets during the years presented as our annual impairment testing indicated that all reporting unit goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset fair values exceeded their respective recorded values. However, future changes in the judgments, assumptions and estimates that are used in our impairment testing for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, including discount and tax rates or future cash flow projections, could result in significantly different estimates of the fair values. A significant reduction in the estimated fair values could result in impairment charges that could materially affect the financial statements in any given year. The recorded value of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets from recently acquired businesses are derived from more recent business operating plans and macroeconomic environmental conditions and, therefore, are more susceptible to an adverse change that could require an impairment charge. We review long-lived assets for indicators of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The evaluation is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, which is at the individual asset level or the asset group level, as defined. Undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the related assets are estimated over their useful life based on updated projections. If the evaluation indicates that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable, any potential impairment is measured based upon the fair value of the related assets or asset group as determined by an appropriate market appraisal or other valuation technique. Assets classified as held for sale are recorded at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell. Legal and Other ContingenciesWe are involved in various proceedings, legal actions and claims arising in the normal course of business, including proceedings related to product, labor and intellectual property, and other matters that are more fully described in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The outcomes of these matters will generally not be known for prolonged periods of time. In certain of the legal proceedings, the claimants seek damages, as well as other compensatory and equitable relief, which could result in the payment of significant claims and settlements and/or the imposition of injunctions or other equitable relief. For legal matters for which management has sufficient information to reasonably estimate our future obligations, a liability representing management's best estimate of the probable cost, or the minimum of the range of probable losses when a best estimate within the range is not known, for the resolution of these legal matters is recorded. The estimates are based on consultation with legal counsel, previous settlement experience and settlement strategies. If actual outcomes are less favorable than those projected by management, additional expense may be incurred, which could unfavorably affect future operating results.To partially mitigate losses arising from unfavorable outcomes in such matters, we purchase third-party insurance coverage subject to certain deductibles and loss limitations. Future operating results may be unfavorably impacted by any settlement payments or losses beyond the amounts of insurance carried. In addition, such matters may negatively impact our ability to obtain cost-effective third-party insurance coverage in future periods.NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS No new accounting pronouncements that were issued or became effective during the year have had or are expected to have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. For a discussion of new accounting pronouncements, see Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.OTHER INFORMATIONHedging and Derivative Financial InstrumentsWe distribute our products throughout the world. As a result, our financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as weak economic conditions or changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Our operating results are primarily exposed to changes in exchange rates among the United States dollar, European currencies, in particular the euro, Swiss franc and the British pound, the Japanese yen, the Australian dollar and the Canadian dollar. We develop and manufacture products in the United States, China, France, Germany, Ireland, Puerto Rico and Switzerland and incur costs in the applicable local currencies. This worldwide deployment of facilities serves to partially mitigate the impact of currency exchange rate changes on our cost of sales.We enter into forward currency exchange contracts to mitigate the impact of currency fluctuations on transactions denominated in nonfunctional currencies, thereby limiting risk that would otherwise result from changes in exchange rates. These nonfunctional currency exposures principally relate to intercompany receivables and payables arising from intercompany purchases of manufactured products. The periods of the forward currency exchange contracts correspond to the periods of the exposed transactions, with realized gains and losses included in the measurement and recording of transactions denominated in the nonfunctional currencies. All forward currency exchange contracts are recorded at their fair value each period, with resulting gains (losses) included in other income (expense) in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings.The estimated fair value of forward currency exchange contracts represents the measurement of the contracts at month-end spot rates as adjusted by current forward points. A hypothetical 10% change in foreign currencies relative to the United States dollar would change the December 31, 2011 fair value by approximately $48. We are exposed to credit loss in the event of non-performance by 17 Dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.counterparties on our outstanding forward currency exchange contracts, but we do not anticipate nonperformance by any of our counterparties.We have certain investments in net assets in international locations that are not hedged. These investments are subject to translation gains and losses due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. For 2011, the strengthening of United States dollar relative to foreign currencies decreased the value of these investments in net assets and the related foreign currency translation adjustment loss in shareholders' equity by $20, to $176 from $196 at December 31, 2010.Legal and Regulatory MattersIn April 2011 lawsuits brought by Hill-Rom Company, Inc. and affiliated entities against us were filed in the United States District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin and the United States District Court for the Southern District of Indiana. The suits allege infringement under United States patent laws with respect to certain patient handling equipment manufactured and sold by us and seek damages and permanent injunctions. The Wisconsin lawsuit has subsequently been transferred to the United States District Court in Indiana. We intend to vigorously defend ourselves in these matters. In the third quarter of 2010, we received a subpoena from the United States Department of Justice related to sales, marketing and regulatory matters related to the Stryker PainPump. Also in the third quarter of 2010, we received a subpoena from the United States Department of Justice related to the sales and marketing of the OtisKnee device. These investigations are ongoing. In March 2010 a shareholder's derivative action complaint against certain of our current and former Directors and Officers was filed in the United States District Court for the Western District of Michigan Southern Division. This lawsuit was brought by the Westchester Putnam Counties Heavy and Highway Laborers Local 60 Benefit Funds and Laborers Local 235 Benefit Funds. The complaint alleges claims for breach of fiduciary duties and gross mismanagement in connection with certain product recalls, United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) warning letters, government investigations relating to physician compensation and the criminal proceeding brought against our Biotech division. The case has been stayed while a Special Committee of the Board of Directors evaluates the claims.In January 2010 a purported class action lawsuit against us was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on behalf of those who purchased our common stock between January 25, 2007 and November 13, 2008, inclusive. The lawsuit seeks remedies under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. In May 2010 the lawsuit was transferred to the United States District Court for the Western District of Michigan Southern Division. We are defending ourselves vigorously.In 2009 a federal grand jury in the District of Massachusetts returned an indictment charging Stryker Biotech LLC and certain then-current employees and a former employee of Stryker Biotech with wire fraud, conspiracy to defraud the FDA, distribution of a misbranded device and false statements to the FDA. In January 2012 Stryker Biotech reached a settlement with the United States Attorney's Office for the District of Massachusetts, under which Stryker pled to one misdemeanor charge and paid a non-tax deductible fine of $15. As a result of this resolution, the Department of Justice dismissed all thirteen felony charges against Stryker Biotech contained in the 2009 federal grand jury indictment. All of the charges against the then-current and former employees of Stryker Biotech have also been dismissed.In 2007, the United States Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Inspector General (HHS) issued a civil subpoena to us in seeking to determine whether we violated various laws by paying consulting fees and providing other things of value to orthopedic surgeons and healthcare and educational institutions as inducements to use Stryker's orthopedic medical devices in procedures paid for in whole or in part by Medicare. The investigation is ongoing and we have produced numerous documents and other materials to HHS in response to the subpoena.In 2007 we disclosed that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) made an inquiry of us regarding possible violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in connection with the sale of medical devices in certain foreign countries. Subsequently, in 2008, we received a subpoena from the United States Department of Justice, Criminal Division, requesting certain documents for the period since January 1, 2000 in connection with the SEC inquiry. We are fully cooperating with the United States Department of Justice and the SEC regarding these matters.ITEM 7A.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKQuantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk are included in the ""Results of Operations,” “Financial Condition and Liquidity"" and ""Other Information"" sections of Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition in Item 7 of this report.18 Dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.",2023-12-30 18:43:21.321344
310764,SYK,STRYKER CORP,2013,"ITEM 7.MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.We supplement the reporting of our financial information determined under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) with certain non-GAAP financial measures, including percentage sales growth in constant currency, adjusted net earnings and adjusted diluted net earnings per share. We believe that these non-GAAP measures provide meaningful information to assist shareholders in understanding our financial results and assessing our prospects for future performance. Management believes percentage sales growth in constant currency, adjusted net earnings and adjusted net earnings per diluted share are important indicators of our operations because they exclude items that may not be indicative of or are unrelated to our core operating results and provide a baseline for analyzing trends in our underlying businesses. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures for reviewing the operating results of reportable business segments and analyzing potential future business trends in connection with our budget process and bases certain annual bonus plans on these non-GAAP financial measures. To measure percentage sales growth in constant currency, we remove the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates that affect the comparability and trend of sales. Percentage sales growth in constant currency is calculated by translating current year results at prior year average foreign currency exchange rates. To measure earnings performance on a consistent and comparable basis, we exclude certain items that affect the comparability of operating results and the trend of earnings. Because non-GAAP financial measures are not standardized, it may not be possible to compare these financial measures with other companies' non-GAAP financial measures having the same or similar names. These adjusted financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for reported sales growth, net earnings and diluted net earnings per share, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are an additional way of viewing aspects of our operations that, when viewed with our GAAP results and the reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures at the end of the discussion of Results of Operations below, provide a more complete understanding of our business. We strongly encourage investors and shareholders to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure.ABOUT STRYKERStryker is one of the world's leading medical technology companies, with 2012 revenues of $8,657 and net earnings of $1,298. We are dedicated to helping healthcare professionals perform their jobs more efficiently while enhancing patient care. We offer a diverse array of innovative medical technologies, including reconstructive, medical and surgical, and neurotechnology and spine products, to help people lead more active and more satisfying lives. In the United States, most of our products are marketed directly to doctors, hospitals and other healthcare facilities. In general, we maintain separate dedicated sales forces for each of our principal product lines to provide focus and a high level of expertise to each medical specialty served. Internationally our products are sold in over 100 countries through company-owned sales subsidiaries and branches as well as third-party dealers and distributors. Our business is generally not seasonal in nature; however, the number of reconstructive surgeries is generally lower during the summer months.Recent Business DevelopmentsIn February 2013 we made a voluntary general offer to acquire all the shares of Trauson Holdings Company Limited for HK$7.50 per ordinary share for a total consideration of $764 in an all cash transaction. With this acquisition, which is expected to close before the end of the second quarter of 2013, we will expand our presence in a key emerging market with a product portfolio and pipeline that is targeted at the large and fast growing value segment of the Chinese orthopaedic market. In December 2012 we recorded a charge of $174 ($133 net of taxes), or approximately $0.35 per share, related to the previously disclosed voluntary recall of our Rejuvenate and ABG II modular-neck hip stems. In November 2012 we completed the acquisition of Surpass Medical, Ltd. (Surpass). Surpass is developing and commercializing next-generation flow diversion stent technology to treat brain aneurysms using a unique mesh design and delivery system. The acquisition of Surpass enhances the product offerings within our Neurotechnology product line.In October 2012 Kevin A. Lobo was named our President and Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Lobo replaced Curt R. Hartman, who had served as Interim Chief Executive Officer since the resignation of Stephen P. MacMillan.In August 2012 we refinanced our credit facility with a new $1,000 Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility due August 2017 (2012 Facility). The 2012 Facility replaced the previously outstanding $1,000 Unsecured Credit Facility due in August 2013. In 2012 we recorded $40 in severance and related costs in connection with focused reductions of our global workforce and other restructuring activities that are expected to reduce our global workforce by approximately 5%. The targeted reductions and other restructuring activities were initiated to provide efficiencies and realign resources in advance of the Medical Device Excise Tax, as well as to allow for continued investment in strategic areas and drive growth. In addition, we recorded $7 in intangible asset impairments, $3 in agent conversion and $25 in contractual and other obligations, as certain of our restructuring actions resulted in the discontinued use of specific assets and the exit of certain lease and other commitments.11 Dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specifiedRESULTS OF OPERATIONSOur consolidated results of operations were: Percentage Change 201220112010 2012/20112011/2010Net Sales$8,657$8,307$7,320 4.213.5Gross Profit5,8765,4965,034 6.99.2Research, development & engineering expenses471462394 1.917.3Selling, general & administrative expenses3,4663,1502,707 10.016.4Intangible amortization12312258 0.8110.3Property, plant and equipment impairment——124 —(100.0)Restructuring charges7576— (1.3)—Other income (expense)(36)—(22) —(100.0)Income taxes407341456 19.4(25.2)Net Earnings$1,298$1,345$1,273 (3.5)5.7Diluted Net Earnings per share$3.39$3.45$3.19 (1.7)8.2Our geographic and segment net sales were: Percentage Change 2012/2011 2011/2010 Net Sales ConstantCurrency ConstantCurrency 2012 2011 2010 Reported Reported Geographic sales: United States $5,658 $5,269 $4,793 7.4 7.4 9.9 9.9International 2,999 3,038 2,527 (1.3) 1.9 20.2 13.4Total net sales $8,657 $8,307 $7,320 4.2 5.4 13.5 11.1Segment sales: Reconstructive $3,823 $3,710 $3,549 3.1 4.4 4.5 1.5MedSurg 3,265 3,160 2,803 3.3 4.2 12.7 11.2Neurotechnology and Spine 1,569 1,437 968 9.2 10.5 48.5 46.4Total net sales $8,657 $8,307 $7,320 4.2 5.4 13.5 11.1Net sales increased 4.2% in 2012 after increasing 13.5% in 2011. In 2012 net sales grew by 5.6% as a result of increased unit volume and changes in product mix and 1.2% due to acquisitions, and were negatively impacted by 1.4% due to changes in price and 1.2% due to the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates on net sales. In constant currency, net sales in 2012 increased by 5.4%. In 2011 net sales grew by 6.1% as a result of increased unit volume and changes in product mix, 2.4% due to the favorable impact of foreign currency and 6.8% due to acquisitions, and were negatively impacted by 1.8% due to changes in price. In constant currency, net sales in 2011 increased by 11.1%.The increase in consolidated net sales for 2012 was primarily due to higher shipments of Neurotechnology, Instruments, Trauma and Extremities, Spine and reprocessed and remanufactured medical devices; these gains were partially offset by slowness in the European markets. The increase in consolidated net sales for 2011 was primarily due to sales growth through acquisitions, higher United States shipments of MedSurg products and higher international shipments of MedSurg products and Neurotechnology and Spine products. In the United States net sales increased 7.4% in 2012 after increasing 9.9% in 2011. In constant currency, international sales increased 1.9% in 2012, compared to 13.4% in 2011.

In constant currency, Reconstructive net sales increased by 4.4% in 2012, primarily due to increases in Trauma and Extremities and market share gains in part as a result of a competitor's product recall, offset in part by slowness in the European markets. Reconstructive net sales in 2011 increased 4.5% from 2010, primarily due to a 3.4% increase in unit volume and changes in product mix, a 3.0% favorable foreign currency impact and 0.8% due to acquisitions. The increase in units sold was due to higher industry demand. In addition, net sales were negatively impacted by 2.8% due to changes in price. In constant currency, Reconstructive net sales increased by 1.5% in 2011. MedSurg net sales in 2012 increased 3.3% from 2011, primarily due to a 4.1% increase in unit volume and changes in product mix and 0.1% due to acquisitions, and were negatively impacted by 0.1% due to changes in price and 0.9% due to the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates on net sales. In constant currency, MedSurg net sales in 2012 increased 4.2%, led by higher shipments of Instruments and reprocessed and remanufactured medical devices; these higher shipments were partially offset by challenging global market conditions for capital equipment. MedSurg net sales in 2011 increased 12.7% from 2010, led by Medical while Endoscopy and Instruments also increased, primarily due to a 9.5% increase in unit volume and changes in product mix, 1.6% due to the favorable impact of foreign currency and 1.9% due to acquisitions. The effect of pricing on net sales was not significant. In constant currency MedSurg net sales increased by 11.2% in 2011.Neurotechnology and Spine net sales in 2012 increased 9.2% from 2011, primarily due to an 8.5% increase in unit volume and changes in product mix and 4.2% due to acquisitions, and were negatively impacted by 2.2% due to changes in price and 1.3% due to the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates on net sales. In constant currency Neurotechnology and Spine net sales in 2012 increased 10.5%. Neurotechnology and Spine net sales in 2011 increased 48.5% from 2010, primarily due to the acquisition of Neurovascular. Sales growth from acquisitions was 42.6%. The remainder of the increase included 6.3% due to increases in unit volume and changes in product mix and 2.0% due to the favorable impact of foreign currency, and the negative impact of changes in price of 2.5%. In constant currency, Neurotechnology and Spine net sales in 2011 increased by 46.4%.Consolidated Cost of SalesCost of sales decreased 1.1% from 2011 to 32.1% of sales compared to 33.8% in 2011. Cost of sales in 2012 and 2011 includes an additional cost of $18 and $143, respectively, related to inventory that was ""stepped up"" to fair value following acquisitions. Cost of sales for 2012 also included $5 in other restructuring related costs. Aside from these factors, the decrease in the cost of sales percentage in 2012 was primarily due to efficiencies in our manufacturing and distribution network, a favorable product mix and a favorable impact from the effect of foreign currency on costs from our euro-based manufacturing operations. Cost of sales in 2011 increased 23.0% from 2010 to 33.8% of sales compared to 31.2% in 2010. The increase in the cost of sales percentage in 2011 was primarily due to the impact of inventory ""step up"" and lower pricing on sales resulting in an increase in cost of sales as a percentage of sales, the impact of changes in product mix and of a weaker United States dollar on purchases from international manufacturing operations.Research, Development and Engineering ExpensesResearch, development and engineering expenses represented 5.4% of sales compared to 5.6% in 2011 and 5.4% in 2010. The spending level in 2012 decreased as a percentage of sales primarily due to the termination of all development of the OP-1 molecule in late 2011. The higher spending level in 2011 compared to 2010 was the result of our focus on new product development for anticipated future product launches and continued investments in new technologies. Selling, General and Administrative ExpensesSelling, general and administrative expenses increased 10.0% and represented 40.0% of sales compared to 37.9% in 2011 and 37.0% in 2010. In 2012 we recorded $37 in acquisition and integration-related charges compared to $66 in 2011. In addition, general and administrative costs in 2012 included $174 related to the previously disclosed voluntary recall of our Rejuvenate and ABG II modular-neck hip stems, $33 offered to the DOJ to settle the subpoena received in 2010 related to the sales and marketing of the OtisKnee device and $8 in separation costs associated with our former Chief Executive Officer. In 2011 general and administrative expenses included the payment of an intellectual property infringement claim, offset by a favorable resolution of a value added tax issue. In 2010 we sold a manufacturing facility in France and recorded a gain of $24 that is included in general and administrative expenses. Restructuring ChargesIn 2012 and 2011 we recorded $75 and $76, respectively, in restructuring charges related to focused reductions of our global workforce and other restructuring, expected to reduce our global workforce by approximately 5% and be complete by the end of 2013 at a total cost of approximately $225. The targeted reductions and other restructuring activities were initiated to provide efficiencies and realign resources in advance of the Medical Device Excise Tax, as well as to allow for continued investment in strategic areas and drive growth.Other Income (Expense)Other expense in 2012 increased $36 from 2011 after decreasing $22 from 2010. The increase in expense in 2012 from 2011 and the reduction in expense from 2010 to 2011 are primarily due to reductions of accrued interest expense in 2011 resulting from settlements 13 Dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specifiedreached with the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS). In 2011 we reached a favorable settlement regarding an IRS proposed adjustment to our previously filed 2003 through 2007 income tax returns related to the income tax positions we had taken for our Irish cost sharing arrangements. We also reached a settlement with the IRS with respect to the allocation of income with a wholly owned subsidiary operating in Puerto Rico for the years 2006 through 2009. The higher interest expense in 2012 due to the effect of the 2011 tax settlements was partially offset by higher interest income on our investments, due to higher cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities balances compared to 2011. Income TaxesOur effective income tax rate on earnings was 23.9%, 20.2% and 26.4% in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The effective income tax rate for 2012 includes the net impact of effective settlement of all tax matters through 2004 relating to two German subsidiaries, and adjustment of the estimate of foreign tax credits to the amount shown on the tax return as filed. The effective income tax rate for 2011 includes the net impact of the settlements with the IRS as described above. The effective income tax rate for 2010 includes the impact of a property, plant and equipment impairment charge, the gain on sale of a manufacturing facility and the favorable income tax expense adjustment associated with the repatriation of foreign earnings to the United States completed in 2009.The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (the Act) was signed on January 2, 2013. The Act provided numerous tax provisions for corporations including an extension of the research tax credit and an extension of certain provisions for companies with significant international operations. These provisions originally expired at December 31, 2011 but were retroactively extended through December 31, 2013. In 2013 we will record tax benefits of approximately $13 related to the 2012 research tax credit and other provisions of the Act.Net EarningsNet earnings in 2012 decreased 3.5% from 2011 to $1,298. Basic net earnings per share in 2012 decreased 2.0% from 2011 to $3.41, and diluted net earnings per share in 2012 decreased 1.7% from 2011 to $3.39. Net earnings in 2011 increased 5.7% from 2010 to $1,345. Basic net earnings per share in 2011 increased 8.4% from 2010 to $3.48, and diluted net earnings per share in 2011 increased 8.2% from 2010 to $3.45. Reported net earnings includes the benefits from settlements and other adjustments related to uncertain tax positions, restructuring and related charges and acquisition and integration related charges, including transaction costs, integration related costs and additional cost of sales for inventory sold in the year that was ""stepped up"" to fair value. In addition, 2012 net earnings includes a charge of $133 (net of taxes) related to the previously disclosed voluntary recall of our Rejuvenate and ABG II modular-neck hip stems, and $33 offered to the United States Department of Justice to resolve the matter related to the sales and marketing of our OtisKnee device for which we have recorded a corresponding non-tax deductible charge. Excluding the impact of these items, adjusted net earnings in 2012 increased 7.7% to $1,560 after increasing 9.0% in 2011. Adjusted diluted net earnings per share in 2012 increased 9.4% to $4.07 after increasing 11.7% in 2011. The following reconciles the non-GAAP financial measures adjusted net earnings and adjusted diluted net earnings per share with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, reported net earnings and diluted net earnings per share: 2012 2011 2010Reported net earnings $1,298 $1,345 $1,273Acquisition and integration-related charges, net of tax: Inventory stepped up to fair value 13 97 —Acquisition and integration-related charges 24 45 —Restructuring and related charges 59 60 —Uncertain income tax position adjustments — (99) —OtisKnee matter 33 — —Rejuvenate and ABG II recall 133 — —Gain on sale of property, plant and equipment — — (13)Income taxes on repatriation of foreign earnings — — (7)Impairment of property, plant and equipment — — 76Adjusted net earnings $1,560 $1,448 $1,329 Diluted net earnings per share of common stock: Reported diluted net earnings per share $3.39 $3.45 $3.19Acquisition and integration-related charges, net of tax: Inventory stepped up to fair value 0.03 0.25 —Acquisition and integration-related charges 0.06 0.12 —Restructuring and related charges 0.15 0.16 —Uncertain income tax position adjustments — (0.26) —OtisKnee matter 0.09 — —Rejuvenate and ABG II recall 0.35 — —Gain on sale of property, plant and equipment — — (0.03)Income taxes on repatriation of foreign earnings — — (0.02)Impairment of property, plant and equipment — — 0.19Adjusted diluted net earnings per share $4.07 $3.72 $3.33Weighted-average diluted shares outstanding 383.0 389.5 399.514 Dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specifiedThe weighted-average basic and diluted shares outstanding used in the calculation of these non-GAAP financial measures are the same as the weighted-average shares outstanding used in the calculation of the reported per share amounts.FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITYOperating ActivitiesOperating cash flow was $1,657 in 2012, an increase of 15.6% from 2011. Operating cash flow resulted primarily from net earnings adjusted for non-cash items (depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation, sale of inventory ""stepped up"" to fair value at acquisition and deferred income taxes). The net of accounts receivable, inventory and accounts payable consumed $50 of operating cash flow in 2012. Inventory contributed $18 of operating cash flow as inventory days on hand decreased by 5 days due to lower inventory levels driven primarily by improved inventory management. Accounts receivable used $20 primarily to support business growth, while accounts receivable days sales outstanding decreased by 3 days due to timing of sales.Operating cash flow was $1,434 in 2011, a decrease of 7.3% from 2010. Operating cash flow resulted primarily from net earnings adjusted for non-cash items (depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation, sale of inventory ""stepped up"" to fair value at acquisition and deferred income taxes). The net of accounts receivable, inventory and accounts payable consumed $274 of operating cash flow in 2011. Inventory consumed $166 of operating cash flow primarily due to the building of inventory related to acquisitions and other business growth, increased stock levels in advance of new product introductions and higher inventory levels in support of anticipated 2012 sales growth. Inventory days on hand increased by 4 days due to the impact of the above. Accounts receivable used $143, primarily due to the building of accounts receivable related to acquisitions and other business growth. Accounts receivable days sales outstanding increased by 2 days due to timing of sales.Investing ActivitiesNet investing activities consumed $736 of cash in 2012 and $2,135 in 2011, primarily due to acquisitions and capital spending.Acquisitions. Acquisitions used $154 of cash in 2012 and $2,066 in 2011. Cash used in 2012 was primarily for the acquisition of Surpass Medical for $99 as well as for milestone payments associated with previous acquisitions. Cash used in 2011 was primarily for the acquisitions of Neurovascular for $1,450; Orthovita for $316; Memometal for $150; and Concentric for $135. Capital Spending. We manage capital spending to support our business growth. Capital expenditures, primarily to support integration of acquisitions, capacity expansion, new product introductions, innovation and cost savings, were $210 in 2012 and $226 in 2011.Proceeds from Asset Sales. Proceeds from asset sales contributed $67 to cash in 2011, primarily due to the sale of certain assets related to the OP-1 product family. Financing ActivitiesDividend Payments. Dividends paid per common share increased 18.1% to $0.85 per share in 2012. Total dividend payments to common shareholders were $324 in 2012 and $279 in 2011. The increase in dividend payments resulted from increases in our quarterly dividend from $0.18 per share in 2011 to $0.2125 per share in 2012.Long-Term and Short-Term Debt. We maintain debt levels we consider appropriate after evaluating a number of factors, including cash flow expectations, cash requirements for ongoing operations, investment and financing plans (including acquisitions and share repurchase activities) and overall cost of capital. In September 2011 we sold $750 of unsecured notes due September 2016. The net proceeds from the offerings have been and will continue to be available for working capital and other general corporate purposes, including acquisitions, stock repurchases and other business opportunities. Total debt was $1,762 in 2012 and $1,768 in 2011. Share Repurchases. The total use of cash for share repurchases was $108 in 2012 and $622 in 2011.LiquidityOur cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $4,285 at December 31, 2012 and $3,418 at December 31, 2011 and our current assets exceeded current liabilities by $6,272 at December 31, 2012 and $5,367 at December 31, 2011. We anticipate being able to support our short-term liquidity and operating needs largely through cash generated from operations. We have also raised funds in the past in the capital markets and may continue to do so from time to time. We have strong short- and long-term debt ratings that we believe should enable us to refinance our debt as it becomes due. In August 2012 we refinanced our credit facility with a new $1,000 Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility due August 2017 (2012 Facility). The 2012 Facility replaced the previously outstanding $1,000 Unsecured Credit Facility that would have become due in August 2013. The 2012 Facility includes an increase option permitting us to increase the size of the facility up to an additional $500, a $500 multicurrency sublimit (with no sublimit for euro borrowings) and a $100 letter of credit sublimit. The 2012 Facility has an 15 Dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specifiedannual facility fee ranging from 5 to 22.5 basis points and bears interest at LIBOR, as defined in the 2012 Facility agreement, plus an applicable margin ranging from 57.5 to 127.5 basis points, both of which are dependent on our credit ratings.Should additional funds be required we had approximately $1,063 of borrowing capacity available under all of our existing credit facilities at December 31, 2012, including the 2012 Facility. In February of 2013 we made a voluntary general offer to acquire Trauson Holdings Company Limited, a leading manufacturer of trauma and spine products in China. In connection with this offer, we have restricted $800 of our available borrowing capacity until the completion of the tender offer. The transaction is expected to close by the end of the second quarter of 2013.At December 31, 2012, approximately 60% of our consolidated cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were held outside of the United States. These funds are considered indefinitely reinvested to be used to expand operations either organically or through acquisitions outside the United States.Several European countries, including Spain, Portugal, Italy and Greece (the Southern European Region), have been subject to credit deterioration due to weaknesses in their economic and fiscal conditions. We continuously monitor our investment portfolio for exposures to the European debt crisis. We currently do not have any investments in the sovereign debt instruments of the Southern European Region. Any non-sovereign exposure in these countries in our investment portfolio is considered immaterial. We continually evaluate our receivables, particularly in the Southern European Region. The total net receivables from the Southern European Region were approximately $198 and $257 at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, including approximately $103 and $170, respectively, of sovereign receivables. We believe that our current reserves related to receivables are adequate and any additional credit risk associated with the European debt crisis is not expected to have a material adverse impact on our financial position or liquidity. Guarantees and Other Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsWe do not have guarantees or other off-balance sheet financing arrangements, including variable interest entities, of a magnitude that we believe could have a material impact on our financial condition or liquidity.CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND FORWARD-LOOKING CASH REQUIREMENTSAs further described in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, as of December 31, 2012 our defined benefit pension plans were underfunded by $193, of which approximately $183 related to plans outside the United States. Due to the rules affecting tax-deductible contributions in the jurisdictions the plans are offered and the impact of future plan asset performance, changes in interest rates and the potential for changes in legislation in the United States and other foreign jurisdictions, we are not able to reasonably estimate the future periods, beyond 2013, in which contributions to fund defined benefit pension plans will be made. As further described in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, as of December 31, 2012 we have recorded a liability for uncertain income tax positions of $227. Due to uncertainties regarding the ultimate resolution of income tax audits, we are not able to reasonably estimate the future periods in which income tax payments to settle these uncertain income tax positions will be made.Our future contractual obligations for agreements with initial terms greater than one year, including agreements to purchase materials in the normal course of business, are: Payment Period 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 After 2017 TotalShort-term and Long-term debt$16 $— $500 $— $— $1,246 $1,762Unconditional purchase obligations454 119 53 8 1 2 637Operating leases47 37 32 26 23 37 202Contributions to defined benefit plans19 — — — — — 19Other4 3 2 2 2 49 62 $540 $159 $587 $36 $26 $1,334 $2,682CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATESIn preparing our financial statements in accordance with GAAP, there are certain accounting policies that may require a choice between acceptable accounting methods or may require substantial judgment or estimation in their application. These include allowance for doubtful accounts, inventory reserves, income taxes, acquisitions, goodwill and intangible assets, and legal and other contingencies. We believe these accounting policies and the others set forth in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements should be reviewed as they are integral to understanding our results of operations and financial condition. 16 Dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specifiedAllowance for Doubtful AccountsWe maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses in the collection of accounts receivable. We make estimates regarding the future ability of our customers to make required payments based on historical credit experience and expected future trends. If actual customer financial conditions are less favorable than projected by management, additional accounts receivable write offs may be necessary, which could unfavorably affect future operating results.Inventory ReservesWe maintain reserves for excess and obsolete inventory resulting from the potential inability to sell certain products at prices in excess of current carrying costs. We make estimates regarding the future recoverability of the costs of these products and record provisions based on historical experience, expiration of sterilization dates and expected future trends. If actual product life cycles, product demand or acceptance of new product introductions are less favorable than projected by management, additional inventory write downs may be required, which could unfavorably affect future operating results.Income TaxesOur annual tax rate is determined based on our income, statutory tax rates and the tax impacts of items treated differently for tax purposes than for financial reporting purposes. Tax law requires certain items be included in the tax return at different times than the items are recorded in the financial statements. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return, and some differences are temporary and reverse over time, such as depreciation expense. These temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent the tax effect of items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in our financial statements. Deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in our financial statements for which payment has been deferred, the tax effect of expenditures for which a deduction has already been taken in our tax return but has not yet been recognized in our financial statements or assets recorded at fair value in business combinations for which there was no corresponding tax basis adjustment. Inherent in determining our annual tax rate are judgments regarding business plans, tax planning opportunities and expectations about future outcomes. Realization of certain deferred tax assets is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction prior to the expiration of the carryforward periods. Although realization is not assured, management believes it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances, will be realized. We operate in multiple jurisdictions with complex tax policy and regulatory environments. In certain of these jurisdictions, we may take tax positions that management believes are supportable but are potentially subject to successful challenge by the applicable taxing authority. These differences of interpretation with the respective governmental taxing authorities can be impacted by the local economic and fiscal environment. We evaluate our tax positions and establish liabilities in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance on uncertainty in income taxes. We review these tax uncertainties in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of tax audits, and adjust them accordingly. We have a number of audits in process in various jurisdictions. Although the resolution of these tax positions is uncertain, based on currently available information, we believe that it is more likely than not that the ultimate outcomes will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Because there are a number of estimates and assumptions inherent in calculating the various components of our tax provision, certain changes or future events, such as changes in tax legislation, geographic mix of earnings, completion of tax audits or earnings repatriation plans, could have an impact on those estimates and our effective tax rate.Acquisitions, Goodwill and Intangibles, and Long-Lived AssetsWe account for acquired businesses using the purchase method of accounting. Under the purchase method, our financial statements include the operations of an acquired business starting from the completion of the acquisition. In addition, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective estimated fair values, with any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired recorded as goodwill. Significant judgment is required in estimating the fair value of intangible assets and in assigning their respective useful lives. Accordingly, we typically obtain the assistance of third-party valuation specialists for significant items. The fair value estimates are 17 Dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specifiedbased on available historical information and on future expectations and assumptions deemed reasonable by management but are inherently uncertain. We typically use an income method to estimate the fair value of intangible assets, which is based on forecasts of the expected future cash flows attributable to the respective assets. Significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the valuations reflect a consideration of other marketplace participants and include the amount and timing of future cash flows (including expected growth rates and profitability), the underlying product or technology life cycles, the economic barriers to entry and the discount rate applied to the cash flows. Unanticipated market or macroeconomic events and circumstances may occur that could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and assumptions. Determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment. The majority of our acquired intangible assets (e.g., certain trademarks or brands, customer relationships, patents and technologies) are expected to have determinable useful lives. Our assessment as to the useful lives of these intangible assets is based on a number of factors including competitive environment, market share, trademark and/or brand history, underlying product life cycles, operating plans and the macroeconomic environment of the countries in which the trademarks or brands are sold. Our estimates of the useful lives of determinable-lived intangibles are primarily based on these same factors. Determinable-lived intangible assets are amortized to expense over their estimated useful life. In certain of our acquisitions, we acquire in-process research and development (IPRD) intangible assets. IPRD is considered to be an indefinite-lived intangible asset until such time as the research is completed (at which time it becomes a determinable-lived intangible asset) or determined to have no future use (at which time it is impaired). The value of indefinite-lived intangible assets and residual goodwill is not amortized but is tested at least annually for impairment. Our impairment testing for goodwill is performed separately from our impairment testing of indefinite-lived intangibles. We perform our annual impairment test for goodwill in the fourth quarter of each year. We have adopted the provisions of Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2011-08, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other: Testing Goodwill for Impairment, which permits us to consider qualitative indicators of the fair value of a reporting unit when it is unlikely that a reporting unit has impaired goodwill. In certain circumstances, we may also utilize a discounted cash flow analysis that requires certain assumptions and estimates be made regarding market conditions and our future profitability. In those circumstances we test goodwill for impairment by reviewing the book value compared to the fair value at the reporting unit level. We test individual indefinite-lived intangibles by reviewing the individual book values compared to the fair value. We determine the fair value of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets based on the income approach. Under the income approach, we calculate the fair value of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. Considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating and macroeconomic changes and to estimate future cash flows to measure fair value. Assumptions used in our impairment evaluations, such as forecasted growth rates and cost of capital, are consistent with internal projections and operating plans. We believe such assumptions and estimates are also comparable to those that would be used by other marketplace participants. We did not recognize any material impairment charges for goodwill during the years presented, as our annual impairment testing indicated that all reporting unit goodwill fair values exceeded their respective recorded values. Future changes in the judgments, assumptions and estimates that are used in our impairment testing for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, including discount and tax rates or future cash flow projections, could result in significantly different estimates of the fair values. A significant reduction in the estimated fair values could result in impairment charges that could materially affect our financial statements.We review long-lived assets for indicators of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The evaluation is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, which is at the individual asset level or the asset group level. The undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the related assets are estimated over their useful life based on updated projections. If the evaluation indicates that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable, any potential impairment is measured based upon the fair value of the related assets or asset group as determined by an appropriate market appraisal or other valuation technique. Assets classified as held for sale, if any, are recorded at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell. Legal and Other ContingenciesWe are involved in various ongoing proceedings, legal actions and claims arising in the normal course of business, including proceedings related to product, labor and intellectual property, and other matters that are more fully described in ""Other Information"" below and in Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The outcomes of these matters will generally not be known for prolonged periods of time. In certain of the legal proceedings, the claimants seek damages, as well as other compensatory and 18 Dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specifiedequitable relief, that could result in the payment of significant claims and settlements and/or the imposition of injunctions or other equitable relief. For legal matters for which management has sufficient information to reasonably estimate our future obligations, a liability representing management's best estimate of the probable loss, or the minimum of the range of probable losses when a best estimate within the range is not known, for the resolution of these legal matters is recorded. The estimates are based on consultation with legal counsel, previous settlement experience and settlement strategies. If actual outcomes are less favorable than those projected by management, additional expense may be incurred, which could unfavorably affect future operating results.To partially mitigate losses arising from unfavorable outcomes in such matters, we purchase third-party insurance coverage subject to certain deductibles and loss limitations. Future operating results may be unfavorably impacted by any settlement payments or losses beyond the amounts of insurance carried. In addition, such matters may negatively impact our ability to obtain cost effective third-party insurance coverage in future periods.NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS No accounting pronouncements that were issued or became effective during the year have had or are expected to have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. For a discussion of new accounting pronouncements, see Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.OTHER INFORMATIONHedging and Derivative Financial InstrumentsWe sell our products throughout the world. As a result, our financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as weak economic conditions or changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Our operating results are primarily exposed to changes in exchange rates among the United States dollar, European currencies, in particular the euro, Swiss franc and the British pound, the Japanese yen, the Australian dollar and the Canadian dollar. We develop and manufacture products in the United States, China, France, Germany, Ireland, Puerto Rico and Switzerland and incur costs in the applicable local currencies. This worldwide deployment of facilities serves to partially mitigate the impact of currency exchange rate changes on our cost of sales.We enter into forward currency exchange contracts to mitigate the impact of currency fluctuations on transactions denominated in nonfunctional currencies, thereby limiting risk that would otherwise result from changes in exchange rates. These nonfunctional currency exposures principally relate to intercompany receivables and payables arising from intercompany purchases of manufactured products. The periods of the forward currency exchange contracts correspond to the periods of the exposed transactions, with realized gains and losses included in the measurement and recording of transactions denominated in the nonfunctional currencies. All forward currency exchange contracts are recorded at their fair value each period, with resulting gains (losses) included in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings.The estimated fair value of forward currency exchange contracts represents the measurement of the contracts at month-end spot rates as adjusted by current forward points. A hypothetical 10% change in foreign currencies relative to the United States dollar would change the December 31, 2012 fair value by approximately $10. We are exposed to credit loss in the event of non performance by counterparties on our outstanding forward currency exchange contracts, but we do not anticipate nonperformance by any of our counterparties.We have certain investments in net assets in international locations that are not hedged. These investments are subject to translation gains and losses due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. For 2012 the strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the United States dollar increased the value of these investments in net assets and the related foreign currency translation adjustment gain in shareholders' equity by $50, to $226 from $176 as of December 31, 2011.Legal and Regulatory MattersOn June 28, 2012 we voluntarily recalled our Rejuvenate and ABG II modular-neck hip stems and terminated global distribution of these hip products. We notified healthcare professionals and regulatory bodies of this recall, which was taken due to potential risks associated with fretting and/or corrosion that may lead to adverse local tissue reactions. Product liability lawsuits relating to this voluntary recall have been filed against us. As previously announced, we intend to reimburse implanted patients for reasonable and customary costs of testing and treatment services, including any necessary revision surgeries. We continue to work with the medical community to evaluate the data and further understand this matter and the associated costs. The ultimate total cost with respect to this matter will depend on many factors that are difficult to predict with the limited information received to date and may vary materially based on the number of and actual costs of patients seeking testing and treatment services, the number of and actual costs of patients requiring revision surgeries, the number of and actual costs to settle lawsuits filed against us, and the amount of third-party insurance recoveries. Based on the information that has been received, we estimate the probable loss to resolve this matter to be in the range of approximately $190 to $390, before third-party insurance recoveries. Accordingly, in December 2012 we recorded a charge to earnings of $174 representing the excess of the $190 minimum of the range over the previously recorded reserves. No contingent gain 19 Dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specifiedfor third-party recoveries was recorded as of December 31, 2012. As noted above, the final outcome of this matter is dependent on many variables that are difficult to predict. The ultimate cost to entirely resolve this matter may be materially different than the amount of the current estimate and accruals and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.In 2010 we received a subpoena from the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) related to the sales and marketing of the OtisKnee device. The subpoena concerns allegations of violations of Federal laws related to sales of a device not cleared by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). We entered into discussions with the DOJ regarding the potential resolution of this matter and, in the second quarter of 2012 we recorded a non-tax deductible charge of $33 for this matter. We continue to discuss this matter with the DOJ, but there can be no assurance that we will reach a consensual resolution rather than seeking a resolution through the courts. While we believe we have strong arguments to defend against these allegations, if our defense is ultimately unsuccessful we estimate that it is reasonably possible that the total cost to resolve this matter may be approximately two times greater than the amount we have accrued. The final outcome of this matter is difficult to predict, and the ultimate cost to resolve this matter may be materially different than the amount of the current estimate and accruals and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.In 2010 a shareholders' derivative action complaint against certain of our current and former Directors and Officers was filed in the United States District Court for the Western District of Michigan Southern Division. This lawsuit was brought by the Westchester Putnam Counties Heavy and Highway Laborers Local 60 Benefit Funds and Laborers Local 235 Benefit Funds. The complaint alleged claims for breach of fiduciary duties and gross mismanagement in connection with certain product recalls, FDA warning letters, government investigations relating to physician compensation and the criminal proceeding brought against our Biotech division. We recently entered into a settlement agreement that requires changes to certain of Stryker's corporate governance practices.For each of the following legal matters the final outcome is dependent on many variables and cannot be predicted. Accordingly, it is not possible at this time for us to estimate any material loss or range of losses. However, the ultimate cost to resolve these matters could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.In April 2011 lawsuits brought by Hill-Rom Company, Inc. and affiliated entities (Hill-Rom) against us were filed in the United States District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin and the United States District Court for the Southern District of Indiana. The Wisconsin lawsuit was subsequently transferred to the United States District Court in Indiana. The suits allege infringement under United States patent laws with respect to certain patient handling equipment we manufactured and sold and seek damages and permanent injunctions. The first lawsuit involved ten patents related to the use of a motorized wheel for hospital beds and stretchers. We recently entered into an agreement settling that lawsuit. This agreement included a payment to Hill-Rom of $3.75, a covenant not to sue and a cross-license. The second lawsuit involves nine patents related to electrical network communications for hospital beds. The case has been stayed with respect to six of the patents, which are currently under reexamination by the United States Patent Office. With respect to the suit and the three remaining patents, we continue to vigorously defend ourselves. The ultimate resolution of the second suit may have no relation to the resolution of the first suit and cannot be predicted; however, the ultimate cost could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.In 2010 we received a subpoena from the DOJ related to sales, marketing and regulatory matters related to the Stryker PainPump. We recently received requests for certain documents in connection with this investigation. The investigation is ongoing and we are fully cooperating with the DOJ regarding this matter.In 2007 we disclosed that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) made an inquiry of us regarding possible violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in connection with the sale of medical devices in certain foreign countries. Subsequently, in 2008, we received a subpoena from the United States DOJ, Criminal Division, requesting certain documents for the period since January 1, 2000 in connection with the SEC inquiry. We are fully cooperating with the DOJ and the SEC regarding these matters. In 2007 the United States Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Inspector General (HHS) issued us a civil subpoena seeking to determine whether we violated various laws by paying consulting fees and providing other things of value to orthopedic surgeons and healthcare and educational institutions as inducements to use Stryker's orthopedic medical devices in procedures paid for in whole or in part by Medicare. We have produced numerous documents and other materials to HHS in response to the subpoena.ITEM 7A.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKWe consider our material area of market risk exposure to be exchange rate risk. Quantitative and qualitative disclosures about exchange rate risk are included in the ""Other Information"" section of Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition in Item 7, under the caption ""Hedging and Derivative Financial Instruments"" on page 19. 20 Dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified",2023-12-30 18:43:22.337122
310764,SYK,STRYKER CORP,2014,"ITEM 7.MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURESWe supplement the reporting of our financial information determined under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) with certain non-GAAP financial measures, including percentage sales growth in constant currency; percentage organic sales growth; adjusted gross profit; adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses; adjusted operating income; adjusted other income (expense); adjusted effective income tax rate; adjusted net earnings; and adjusted diluted net earnings per share. We believe that these non-GAAP measures provide meaningful information to assist shareholders in understanding our financial results and assessing our prospects for future performance. Management believes percentage sales growth in constant currency and the other adjusted measures described above are important indicators of our operations because they exclude items that may not be indicative of or are unrelated to our core operating results and provide a baseline for analyzing trends in our underlying businesses. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures for reviewing the operating results of reportable business segments and analyzing potential future business trends in connection with our budget process and bases certain management incentive compensation on these non-GAAP financial measures. To measure percentage sales growth in constant currency, we remove the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates that affect the comparability and trend of sales. Percentage sales growth in constant currency is calculated by translating current year results at prior year average foreign currency exchange rates. To measure percentage organic sales growth, we remove the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and acquisitions that affect the comparability and trend of sales. Percentage organic sales growth is calculated by translating current year results at prior year average foreign currency exchange rates excluding the impact of acquisitions. To measure earnings performance on a consistent and comparable basis, we exclude certain items that affect the comparability of operating results and the trend of earnings. Because non-GAAP financial measures are not standardized, it may not be possible to compare these financial measures with other companies' non-GAAP financial measures having the same or similar names. These adjusted financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for reported sales growth, gross profit, selling, general and administrative expenses, operating income, other income/(expense), effective income tax rate, net earnings and diluted net earnings per share, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are an additional way of viewing aspects of our operations that, when viewed with our GAAP results and the reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures at the end of the discussion of Results of Operations below, provide a more complete understanding of our business. We strongly encourage investors and shareholders to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. ABOUT STRYKERStryker is one of the world's leading medical technology companies, with 2013 revenues of $9,021 and net earnings of $1,006. We are dedicated to helping healthcare professionals perform their jobs more efficiently while enhancing patient care. We offer a diverse array of innovative medical technologies, including reconstructive, medical and surgical, and neurotechnology and spine products, to help people lead more active and more satisfying lives. In the United States, most of our products are marketed directly to doctors, hospitals and other healthcare facilities. In general, we maintain separate dedicated sales forces for each of our principal product lines to provide focus and a high level of expertise to each medical specialty served. Internationally our products are sold in over 100 countries through company-owned sales subsidiaries and branches as well as third-party dealers and distributors. Our business is generally not seasonal in nature; however, the number of reconstructive implant surgeries is generally lower during the summer months and sales of capital equipment are generally higher in the fourth quarter.Recent Business DevelopmentsIn December 2013 we announced our intent to acquire Patient Safety Technologies, Inc. (PST), for an aggregate purchase price of $120. PST conducts its business through its wholly owned subsidiary, SurgiCount Medical, Inc. Its proprietary Safety-Sponge® System and SurgiCount 360™ compliance software help prevent Retained Foreign Objects in the operating room. The System includes bar-coded surgical sponges and towels, an integrated bar-code scanner, and compliance tracking software. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions and is expected to close in the first quarter of 2014.In December 2013 we acquired MAKO Surgical Corp. (MAKO) for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $1,679. The acquisition of MAKO, combined with our strong history in joint reconstruction, capital equipment (operating room integration and surgical navigation) and surgical instruments, will help further advance the growth of robotic arm assisted surgery. Our combined expertise offers the potential to simplify joint reconstruction procedures, reduce variability and enhance the surgeon and patient experience. In April 2013 William R. Jellison was named our Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Jellison replaced Dean Bergy who was our Interim Chief Financial Officer.In March 2013 we sold $600 of senior unsecured notes due 2018 (the 2018 Notes) and $400 of senior unsecured notes due 2043 (the 2043 Notes). The 2018 Notes bear interest at 1.3% per year and, unless previously redeemed, will mature in April 1, 2018. The 2043 Notes bear interest at 4.1% per year and, unless previously redeemed, will mature on April 1, 2043. We intend to use the net proceeds from the offering for working capital and other general 10 Dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specifiedcorporate purposes, including acquisitions, stock repurchases and other business opportunities. In March 2013 we acquired Trauson Holdings Company Limited for a total consideration of $751. With this acquisition we expanded our presence in a key emerging market with a product portfolio and pipeline that is targeted at the large and fast growing value segment of the Chinese orthopaedic market. In 2013 we recorded charges for the Rejuvenate, ABG II and Neptune recalls of $460, net of tax, and other matters that are discussed more fully in Results of Operations below.

In 2013 net sales grew by 6.5% as a result of increased unit volume and changes in product mix and 0.8% due to acquisitions and were negatively impacted by 1.4% due to changes in price and 1.6% due to the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates on net sales. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, net sales increased 5.1% in constant currency. Net sales in 2012 increased 5.6% as a result of unit volume and changes in product mix and 1.2% due to acquisitions and were negatively impacted by 1.4% due to changes in price and 1.2% due to the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates on net sales. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, 2012 net sales increased 4.2% in constant currency. Net sales in 2013 increased primarily due to higher shipments of trauma and extremities products, neurotechnology products, hips and endoscopy products. Net sales in 2012 increased primarily due to higher shipments of neurotechnology products, instruments products, trauma and extremities products, spine products and reprocessed and remanufactured medical devices; these gains were partially offset by slowness in the European markets. In the United States net sales increased 5.8% in 2013 after increasing 7.4% in 2012. In constant currency, International sales increased 6.0% in 2013 after increasing 1.9% in 2012.

Net sales were negatively impacted by 2.4% due to changes in price and 2.1% due to the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates on net sales. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, net sales increased by 5.5% in constant currency in 2013, primarily due to increases in trauma and extremities products and hips. Net sales in 2012 increased 3.1%, primarily due to a 5.6% increase in unit volume and changes in product mix and 0.9% due to acquisitions. Net sales were negatively impacted by 2.2% due to changes in price and 1.3% due to the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates on net sales. In constant currency, net sales increased by 4.4% in 2012, primarily due to increases in trauma and extremities products and market share gains partially due to a competitor's product recall, partially offset by slowness in the European markets.MedSurg Net SalesMedSurg net sales in 2013 increased 2.9%, primarily due to a 3.8% increase in unit volume and changes in product mix and were negatively impacted by 0.9% due to the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates on net sales. The effect of pricing was not significant. In constant currency, net sales in 2013 increased 3.8%, led by higher shipments of endoscopy products. Net sales in 2012 increased 3.3%, primarily due to a 4.1% increase in unit volume and changes in product mix and 0.1% due to acquisitions, and were negatively impacted by 0.1% due to changes in price and 0.9% due to the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates on net sales. In constant currency, net sales in 2012 increased 4.2%, led by higher shipments of instruments products and reprocessed and remanufactured medical devices; these higher shipments were partially offset by challenging global market conditions for capital equipment.Neurotechnology and Spine Net SalesNeurotechnology and Spine net sales in 2013 increased 5.6%, primarily due to an 8.8% increase in unit volume and changes in product mix and 0.9% due to acquisitions, and were negatively impacted by 2.0% due to changes in price and 2.1% due to the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates on net sales. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, net sales in 2013 increased 6.8% in constant currency, due to higher shipments of neurotechnology products. Net sales in 2012 increased 9.2%, primarily due to an 8.5% increase in unit volume and changes in product mix and 4.2% due to acquisitions, and were negatively impacted by 2.2% due to changes in price and 1.3% due to the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates on net sales. In constant currency net sales in 2012 increased 10.5%. Consolidated Cost of SalesCost of sales increased 7.0% in 2013 to 33.0% of sales compared to 32.1% in 2012. The Medical Device Excise Tax was 0.9% of sales in the current year. Cost of sales as a percentage of sales was adversely impacted by changes in selling prices for our products and by the unfavorable effect of foreign currency exchange rates; these effects were offset by improvements in manufacturing productivity. Cost of sales in 2013 and 2012 includes an additional cost of $28 and $18, respectively, related to inventory that was ""stepped up"" to fair value following acquisitions; $11 and $5, respectively in restructuring and restructuring related costs; and $7 in 2013 for disgorgement of profits associated with a legal settlement. Cost of sales decreased 1.1% in 2012 to 32.1% of sales compared to 33.8% in 2011. Cost of sales in 2012 and 2011 includes an additional cost of $18 and $143, respectively, related to inventory that was ""stepped up"" to fair value following acquisitions and $5 in 2012 in restructuring and related costs. Research, Development and Engineering ExpensesResearch, development and engineering expenses represented 5.9% of sales in 2013 compared to 5.4% in 2012 and 5.6% in 2011. The increased spending level in 2013 was driven by the timing of projects and continued investment in new technologies. The spending level in 2012 decreased as a percentage of sales primarily due to the termination of all development of the OP-1 molecule in late 2011. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 17.3% in 2013 and represented 45.1% of sales compared to 40.0% in 2012 and 37.9% in 2011. These expenses included $70 and $37 in 2013 and 2012, respectively, of acquisition and integration related charges; $622 and $174, respectively, related to the Rejuvenate, ABG II and Neptune recalls; $62 and $33 in 2013 and 2012, respectively, related to regulatory and legal matters; $25 in 2013 representing a donation to an educational institution and $4 in 2013 in restructuring related charges. Excluding the impact of these charges, selling, general and administrative expenses were 36.4% of sales in 2013 compared to 37.2% in 2012. In 2011 general and administrative expenses included the payment of an intellectual property infringement claim, offset by a favorable resolution of a value added tax issue.Restructuring ChargesIn 2013, 2012 and 2011 we recorded $50 ($2 in cost of sales and $48 in selling, general and administrative expense), $75 and $76, respectively, in restructuring charges related to focused reductions of our global workforce and other restructuring initiatives. The targeted reductions and other restructuring activities were initiated to provide efficiencies and realign resources as well as to allow for continued investment in strategic areas and drive growth.Other Income (Expense)Other expense increased by $8 in 2013 after increasing by $36 in 2012. Net expense in 2013 increased due to lower income from interest and marketable securities, offset by hedge gains and lower interest expense. The decrease in interest expense was due to favorable tax audit resolutions in multiple jurisdictions that resulted in interest expense credits, partially offset by higher interest expense on borrowings. The increase in 2012 was primarily due to reductions of accrued interest expense in 2011 resulting from settlements reached with the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS). In 2011 we reached a favorable settlement regarding an IRS proposed adjustment to our previously filed 2003 through 2007 income tax returns related to the income tax positions we had taken for our Irish cost sharing arrangements. We also reached a settlement with the IRS with respect to the allocation of income 12 Dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specifiedwith a wholly owned subsidiary operating in Puerto Rico for the years 2006 through 2009. The higher interest expense in 2012 due to the effect of the 2011 tax settlements was partially offset by higher interest income on our investments, due to higher cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities balances compared to 2011. Income TaxesOur effective income tax rate on earnings was 17.0%, 23.9% and 20.2% in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The effective income tax rate for 2013 includes income tax benefits relating to favorable audit resolutions in multiple jurisdictions. The effective income tax rate for 2012 includes the net impact of effective settlement of all tax matters through 2004 relating to two German subsidiaries, and adjustment of the estimate of foreign tax credits to the amount shown on the tax return as filed. The effective income tax rate for 2011 includes the net impact of the settlements with the IRS as described above. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (the Act) was signed on January 2, 2013. The Act provided numerous tax provisions for corporations including an extension of the research tax credit and an extension of certain provisions for companies with significant international operations. The provisions originally expired at December 31, 2011 but were retroactively extended through December 31, 2013. In 2013 we recorded tax benefits of $13 related to the 2012 research tax credit and other provision of the Act. Net EarningsNet earnings in 2013 decreased 22.5% to $1,006. Basic net earnings per share in 2013 decreased 22.0% to $2.66, and diluted net earnings per share in 2013 decreased 22.4% to $2.63. Net earnings in 2012 decreased 3.5% to $1,298. Basic net earnings per share in 2012 decreased 2.0% to $3.41, and diluted net earnings per share in 2012 decreased 1.7% to $3.39. Reported net earnings in 2013 includes charges for the Rejuvenate, ABG II and Neptune recalls, acquisition and integration related charges related to the Neurovascular, Surpass, Trauson and MAKO acquisitions, additional cost of sales for inventory sold that was ""stepped up"" to fair value related to the Trauson and MAKO acquisitions, restructuring and related charges, certain charges related to legal and regulatory matters, a donation to an educational institution and benefits associated with the resolution of certain tax matters. Excluding the impact of these items, adjusted net earnings in 2013 increased 3.6% to $1,616 after increasing 7.7% in 2012. Adjusted diluted net earnings per share in 2013 increased 3.9% to $4.23 after increasing 9.4% in 2012.

These increases were partially offset by higher levels of inventory and accounts receivable. The net of accounts receivable, inventory and accounts payable resulted in the consumption of $165 of cash in 2013. Inventory days on hand improved by 1 day due to continued focus on improved inventory management; accounts receivable days sales outstanding remained consistent with 2012.Operating cash flow was $1,657 in 2012, an increase of 15.6%, and resulted primarily from net earnings adjusted for non-cash items (depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation, sale of inventory ""stepped up"" to fair value at acquisition and deferred income taxes). The net of accounts receivable, inventory and accounts payable consumed $50 of cash in 2012. Inventory reductions contributed $18 of cash as inventory days on hand decreased by 5 days, due to lower inventory levels driven primarily by improved inventory management. Accounts receivable increases from business growth resulted in the consumption of $20 of cash, while accounts receivable days sales outstanding decreased by 3 days due to timing of sales.Investing ActivitiesNet investing activities resulted in cash consumption of $2,217, $736 and $2,135 in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively, primarily due to acquisitions and capital spending.Acquisitions. Acquisitions resulted in cash consumption of $2,320 in 2013 and $154 in 2012. In 2013 the cash consumed was primarily for Trauson and MAKO. In 2012 cash consumed was primarily for Surpass for $99 as well as for milestone payments related to previous acquisitions. Cash consumed in 2011 of $2,066 was primarily for the acquisitions of Neurovascular for $1,450; Orthovita for $316; Memometal for $150; and Concentric for $135. Capital Spending. We manage capital spending to support our business growth. Capital expenditures, primarily to support integration of acquisitions, information technology infrastructure upgrades, capacity expansion, new product introductions, innovation and cost savings, were $195, $210 and $226 in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.Proceeds from Asset Sales. Proceeds from asset sales contributed $67 of cash in 2011, primarily due to the sale of certain assets related to the OP-1 product family. Financing ActivitiesDividend Payments. Dividends paid per common share increased 24.7% to $1.06 per share in 2013, and increased 18.1% to $0.85 per share in 2012. As a result of the annual increase in dividends paid per share, total dividend payments to common shareholders were $401, $324 and $279 in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Short-term and Long-Term Debt. We maintain debt levels we consider appropriate after evaluating a number of factors, including cash flow expectations, cash requirements for ongoing operations, investment and financing plans (including acquisitions and share repurchase activities) and overall cost of capital. In March 2013 we sold $600 million of senior unsecured notes due 2018 (the 2018 Notes) and $400 million of senior unsecured notes due 2043 (the 2043 Notes). The 2018 Notes bear interest at 1.3% per year and mature in April 1, 2018. The 2043 Notes bear interest at 4.1% per year and mature on April 1, 2043. We intend to use the net proceeds from the offering for working capital and other general corporate purposes, including acquisitions, stock repurchases and other business opportunities. Total debt was $2,764 and $1,762 in 2013 and 2012, respectively. Share Repurchases. The total use of cash for share repurchases was $317, $108 and $622 in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.LiquidityOur cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $3,980 and $4,285 at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, and our current assets exceeded current liabilities by $5,678 and $6,272 at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. We anticipate being able to support our short-term liquidity and operating needs, including settlements related to the Rejuvenate and ABG II recalls, from a variety of sources, including cash from operations, commercial paper and existing credit lines. In the past we have also raised funds in the capital markets and may continue to do so from time to time in the future. We have strong short-term and long-term debt ratings that we believe should enable us to refinance our debt as it becomes due. In August 2012 we refinanced our credit facility with a new $1,000 Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility due August 2017 (2012 Facility). The 2012 Facility replaced the previously outstanding $1,000 Unsecured Credit Facility that would have become due in August 2013. The 2012 Facility includes an increase option permitting us to increase the size of the facility up to an additional $500, a $500 multicurrency sublimit (with no sublimit for euro borrowings) and a $100 letter of credit sublimit. The 2012 Facility has an annual facility fee ranging from 5 to 22.5 basis points and bears interest at LIBOR, as defined in the 2012 Facility agreement, plus an applicable margin ranging from 57.5 to 127.5 basis points, both of which are dependent on our credit ratings.Should additional funds be required we had approximately $1,052 of borrowing capacity available under all of our existing credit facilities at December 31, 2013, including the 2012 Facility. At December 31, 2013, approximately 78% of our consolidated cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were held outside of the United States. These funds are considered indefinitely reinvested to be used to expand operations either organically or through acquisitions outside the United States.We continually evaluate our receivables, particularly in Spain, Portugal, Italy and Greece (the Southern European Region). The total net receivables from the Southern European Region were approximately $199 and $198 at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, including approximately $103 of sovereign 14 Dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specifiedreceivables in both years. We believe that our current reserves related to receivables are adequate and any additional credit risk associated with the Southern European Region is not expected to have a material adverse impact on our financial position or liquidity. We currently do not have any investments in the sovereign debt instruments of the Southern European Region. Any non-sovereign exposure in these countries in our investment portfolio is considered immaterial. Guarantees and Other Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsWe do not have guarantees or other off-balance sheet financing arrangements, including variable interest entities, of a magnitude that we believe could have a material impact on our financial condition or liquidity.CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND FORWARD-LOOKING CASH REQUIREMENTSAs further described in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, as of December 31, 2013 we have recorded charges to earnings totaling $790 representing the minimum of the range of probable loss to resolve the Rejuvenate and ABG II recalls. Based on the information that has been received, the actuarially determined range of probable loss to resolve this matter is estimated to be approximately $790 to $1,235, before third-party insurance recoveries. The final outcome of this matter is dependent on many variables that are difficult to predict. The ultimate cost to entirely resolve this matter may be materially different than the amount of the current estimate and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. We are not able to reasonably estimate the future periods in which payments will be made.As further described in Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, as of December 31, 2013 our defined benefit pension plans were underfunded by $175, of which approximately $174 related to plans outside the United States. Due to the rules affecting tax-deductible contributions in the jurisdictions in which the plans are offered and the impact of future plan asset performance, changes in interest rates and the potential for changes in legislation in the United States and other foreign jurisdictions, we are not able to reasonably estimate, beyond 2013, the amounts that may be required to fund defined benefit pension plans. As further described in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, as of December 31, 2013 we have recorded a liability for uncertain income tax positions of $204. Due to uncertainties regarding the ultimate resolution of income tax audits, we are not able to reasonably estimate the future periods in which income tax payments to settle these uncertain income tax positions will be made. Our future contractual obligations for agreements with initial terms greater than one year, including agreements to purchase materials in the normal course of business, are: Payment Period 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 After 2018 TotalShort-term and long-term debt$25 $500 $750 $— $600 $900 $2,775Unconditional purchase obligations479 136 11 6 33 3 668Operating leases51 53 33 26 21 38 222Contributions to defined benefit plans20 — — — — — 20Other5 5 5 3 2 55 75 $580 $694 $799 $35 $656 $996 $3,760CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATESIn preparing our financial statements in accordance with GAAP, there are certain accounting policies that may require a choice between acceptable accounting methods or may require substantial judgment or estimation in their application. These include allowance for doubtful accounts, inventory reserves, income taxes, acquisitions, goodwill and intangible assets, and legal and other contingencies. We believe these accounting policies and the others set forth in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements should be reviewed as they are integral to understanding our results of operations and financial condition. Allowance for Doubtful AccountsWe maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses in the collection of accounts receivable. We make estimates regarding the future ability of our customers to make required payments based on historical credit experience and expected future trends. If actual customer financial conditions are less favorable than projected by management, additional accounts receivable write offs may be necessary, which could unfavorably affect future operating results.Inventory ReservesWe maintain reserves for excess and obsolete inventory resulting from the potential inability to sell certain products at prices in excess of current carrying costs. We make estimates regarding the future recoverability of the costs of these products and record provisions based on historical experience, expiration of sterilization dates and expected future trends. If actual product life cycles, product demand or acceptance of new product introductions are less favorable than projected by management, additional inventory write downs may be required, which could unfavorably affect future operating results.Income TaxesOur annual tax rate is determined based on our income, statutory tax rates and the tax impacts of items treated differently for tax purposes than for financial reporting purposes. Tax law requires certain items be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible 15 Dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specifiedin our tax return, and some differences are temporary and reverse over time, such as depreciation expense. These temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent the tax effect of items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in our income statement. Deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in our financial statements for which payment has been deferred, the tax effect of expenditures for which a deduction has already been taken in our tax return but has not yet been recognized in our financial statements or assets recorded at fair value in business combinations for which there was no corresponding tax basis adjustment. Inherent in determining our annual tax rate are judgments regarding business plans, tax planning opportunities and expectations about future outcomes. Realization of certain deferred tax assets is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction prior to the expiration of the carryforward periods. Although realization is not assured, management believes it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances, will be realized. We operate in multiple jurisdictions with complex tax policy and regulatory environments. In certain of these jurisdictions, we may take tax positions that management believes are supportable but are potentially subject to successful challenge by the applicable taxing authority. These differences of interpretation with the respective governmental taxing authorities can be impacted by the local economic and fiscal environment. We evaluate our tax positions and establish liabilities in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance on uncertainty in income taxes. We review these tax uncertainties in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of tax audits, and adjust them accordingly. We have a number of audits in process in various jurisdictions. Although the resolution of these tax positions is uncertain, based on currently available information, we believe that it is more likely than not that the ultimate outcomes will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Because there are a number of estimates and assumptions inherent in calculating the various components of our tax provision, certain changes or future events, such as changes in tax legislation, geographic mix of earnings, completion of tax audits or earnings repatriation plans, could have an impact on those estimates and our effective tax rate.Acquisitions, Goodwill and Intangibles, and Long-Lived AssetsWe account for acquired businesses using the purchase method of accounting. Under the purchase method, our financial statements include the operations of an acquired business starting from the completion of the acquisition. In addition, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective estimated fair values, with any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired recorded as goodwill. Significant judgment is required in estimating the fair value of intangible assets and in assigning their respective useful lives. Accordingly, we typically obtain the assistance of third-party valuation specialists for significant items. The fair value estimates are based on available historical information and on future expectations and assumptions deemed reasonable by management but are inherently uncertain. We typically use an income method to estimate the fair value of intangible assets, which is based on forecasts of the expected future cash flows attributable to the respective assets. Significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the valuations reflect a consideration of other marketplace participants and include the amount and timing of future cash flows (including expected growth rates and profitability), the underlying product or technology life cycles, the economic barriers to entry and the discount rate applied to the cash flows. Unanticipated market or macroeconomic events and circumstances may occur that could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and assumptions. Determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment. With the exception of certain trade names, the majority of our acquired intangible assets (e.g., certain trademarks or brands, customer and distributor relationships, patents and technologies) are expected to have determinable useful lives. Our assessment as to the useful lives of these intangible assets is based on a number of factors including competitive environment, market share, trademark and/or brand history, underlying product life cycles, operating plans and the macroeconomic environment of the countries in which the trademarks or brands are sold. Our estimates of the useful lives of determinable-lived intangibles are primarily based on these same factors. Determinable-lived intangible assets are amortized to expense over their estimated useful life. In certain of our acquisitions, we acquire in-process research and development (IPRD) intangible assets. IPRD is considered to be an indefinite-lived intangible asset until such time as the research is completed (at which time it becomes a determinable-lived intangible asset) or determined to have no future use (at which time it is impaired). The value of indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill is not amortized but is tested at least annually for impairment. Our impairment testing for goodwill is performed separately from our impairment testing of indefinite-lived intangibles. We perform our annual impairment test for goodwill in the fourth quarter of each year. We have adopted the provisions of Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2011-08, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other: Testing Goodwill for Impairment, which permits us to consider qualitative indicators of the fair value of a reporting unit when it is unlikely that a reporting unit has impaired goodwill. In certain circumstances, we may also utilize a discounted cash flow analysis that requires certain assumptions and estimates be made regarding market conditions and our future profitability. In those circumstances we test goodwill for impairment by reviewing the book value compared to the fair value at the reporting unit level. We test individual indefinite-lived intangibles by reviewing the individual book values compared to the fair value. 16 Dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specifiedWe determine the fair value of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets based on the income approach. Under the income approach, we calculate the fair value of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. Considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating and macroeconomic changes and to estimate future cash flows to measure fair value. Assumptions used in our impairment evaluations, such as forecasted growth rates and cost of capital, are consistent with internal projections and operating plans. We believe such assumptions and estimates are also comparable to those that would be used by other marketplace participants. We did not recognize any material impairment charges for goodwill during the years presented, as our annual impairment testing indicated that all reporting unit goodwill fair values exceeded their respective recorded values. Future changes in the judgments, assumptions and estimates that are used in our impairment testing for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, including discount and tax rates or future cash flow projections, could result in significantly different estimates of the fair values. A significant reduction in the estimated fair values could result in impairment charges that could materially affect our financial statements.We review our other long-lived assets for indicators of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The evaluation is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, which is at the individual asset level or the asset group level. The undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the related assets are estimated over their useful life based on updated projections. If the evaluation indicates that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable, any potential impairment is measured based upon the fair value of the related assets or asset group as determined by an appropriate market appraisal or other valuation technique. Assets classified as held for sale, if any, are recorded at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell. Legal and Other ContingenciesWe are involved in various ongoing proceedings, legal actions and claims arising in the normal course of business, including proceedings related to product, labor and intellectual property, and other matters that are more fully described in ""Other Information"" below and in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The outcomes of these matters will generally not be known for prolonged periods of time. In certain of the legal proceedings, the claimants seek damages, as well as other compensatory and equitable relief, that could result in the payment of significant claims and settlements and/or the imposition of injunctions or other equitable relief. For legal matters for which management has sufficient information to reasonably estimate our future obligations, a liability representing management's best estimate of the probable loss, or the minimum of the range of probable losses when a best estimate within the range is not known, for the resolution of these legal matters is recorded. The estimates are based on consultation with legal counsel, previous settlement experience and settlement strategies. If actual outcomes are less favorable than those projected by management, additional expense may be incurred, which could unfavorably affect future operating results. The Company is currently self-insured for product liability-related claims and expenses. The ultimate cost to us with respect to product liability claims could be materially different than the amount of the current estimates and accruals and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTSNo accounting pronouncements that were issued or became effective during the year have had or are expected to have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. OTHER INFORMATIONHedging and Derivative Financial InstrumentsWe sell our products throughout the world. As a result, our financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as weak economic conditions or changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Our operating results are primarily exposed to changes in exchange rates among the United States dollar; European currencies, in particular the euro, Swiss franc and the British pound; the Japanese yen; the Australian dollar; and the Canadian dollar. We develop and manufacture products in the United States, China, France, Germany, Ireland, Puerto Rico and Switzerland and incur costs in the applicable local currencies. This worldwide deployment of facilities serves to partially mitigate the impact of currency exchange rate changes on our cost of sales.We enter into designated and non-designated forward currency exchange contracts to mitigate the impact of currency fluctuations on transactions denominated in nonfunctional currencies, thereby limiting risk that would otherwise result from changes in exchange rates. These nonfunctional currency exposures principally relate to intercompany receivables and payables arising from intercompany purchases of manufactured products. The periods of the forward currency exchange contracts correspond to the periods of the exposed transactions, with realized gains and losses included in the measurement and recording of transactions denominated in the nonfunctional currencies. All forward currency exchange contracts are recorded at their fair value each period, with resulting gains (losses) for non-designated forward contracts and any ineffectiveness measured on designated forward currency exchange contracts included in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income, and reclassified into earnings in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings.The estimated fair value of forward currency exchange contracts represents the measurement of the contracts at month-end spot rates as adjusted by current forward points. A hypothetical 10% change in foreign currencies relative to the United States dollar would change the December 31, 2013 fair value by approximately $6. We are exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties on our outstanding forward currency exchange 17 Dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specifiedcontracts, but we do not anticipate nonperformance by any of our counterparties.We have certain investments in net assets in international locations that are not hedged. These investments are subject to translation gains and losses due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. For 2013 the strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the United States dollar increased the value of these investments in net assets and the related foreign currency translation adjustment gain in shareholders' equity by $80 to $306, from $226 as of December 31, 2012.Legal and Regulatory MattersIn 2010 we received a subpoena from the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) related to the sales and marketing of the OtisKnee device. The subpoena concerns allegations of violations of Federal laws related to sales of a device not cleared by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). We continue to discuss the settlement of this matter with the DOJ, but there can be no assurance that we will reach a consensual resolution rather than seeking a resolution through the courts. We have recorded charges totaling $80 related to the above matter, including $47 in the year ended December 31, 2013.In June 2012 we voluntarily recalled our Rejuvenate and ABG II modular-neck hip stems and terminated global distribution of these hip products. We notified healthcare professionals and regulatory bodies of this recall, which was taken due to potential risks associated with fretting and/or corrosion that may lead to adverse local tissue reactions. Product liability lawsuits relating to this voluntary recall have been filed against us. As previously announced, we intend to reimburse implanted patients for reasonable and customary costs of testing and treatment services, including any necessary revision surgeries. We continue to work with the medical community to evaluate the data and further understand this matter and the associated costs. The ultimate total cost with respect to this matter will depend on many factors that are difficult to predict with the information received to date and may vary materially based on the number of and actual costs of patients seeking testing and treatment services, the number of and actual costs of patients requiring revision surgeries, the number of and actual costs to settle lawsuits filed against us, and the amount of third-party insurance recoveries. Based on the information that has been received, the actuarially determined range of probable loss to resolve this matter is estimated to be approximately $790 to $1,235, before third-party insurance recoveries. In the year ended December 31, 2013, we recorded charges to earnings of $600 representing the excess of the $790 minimum of the range over the previously recorded reserves. No contingent gain for third-party insurance recoveries was recorded as of December 31, 2013. As noted above, the final outcome of this matter is dependent on many variables that are difficult to predict. The ultimate cost to entirely resolve this matter may be materially different than the amount of the current estimate and accruals and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.In 2010 we filed a lawsuit in federal court against Zimmer Holdings, Inc. (Zimmer), alleging that a Zimmer product infringed three of our patents. In rulings issued in August and September 2013, the trial judge upheld the February 2013 jury verdict in our favor, issued a permanent injunction barring Zimmer from making or selling infringing products, and ordered Zimmer to pay us at least $228. Zimmer is appealing this ruling and the ultimate resolution of this matter may differ materially. Accordingly, we have not recorded a contingent gain related to this matter. For each of the following legal matters the final outcome is dependent on many variables and cannot be predicted. Accordingly, it is not possible at this time for us to estimate any material loss or range of losses. However, the ultimate cost to resolve these matters could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.In April 2011 lawsuits brought by Hill-Rom Company, Inc. and affiliated entities (Hill-Rom) against us were filed in the United States District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin and the United States District Court for the Southern District of Indiana. The Wisconsin lawsuit was subsequently transferred to the United States District Court in Indiana. The suits allege infringement under United States patent laws with respect to certain patient handling equipment we manufactured and sold and seek damages and permanent injunctions. We have entered into an agreement settling the first lawsuit, with terms as previously disclosed. The second lawsuit involves nine patents related to electrical network communications for hospital beds. The case has been stayed with respect to six of the patents, which are currently under reexamination by the United States Patent Office. With respect to the three remaining patents, Hill-Rom is appealing the trial court's grant of summary judgment in our favor and the ultimate resolution of this particular part of the suit may differ. The ultimate resolution of the entire second suit may have no relation to the resolution of the first suit and cannot be predicted; however, the ultimate result could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.In 2010 we received a subpoena from the DOJ related to sales, marketing and regulatory matters related to the Stryker PainPump. We have received requests for certain documents in connection with this investigation. The investigation is ongoing and we are fully cooperating with the DOJ regarding this matter.ITEM 7A.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKWe consider our material area of market risk exposure to be exchange rate risk.

310764,SYK,STRYKER CORP,2015,"ITEM 7.MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.ABOUT STRYKERStryker is one of the world's leading medical technology companies, with 2014 revenues of $9,675 and net earnings of $515. We offer a diverse array of innovative medical technologies, including reconstructive, medical and surgical, and neurotechnology and spine products to help people lead more active and more satisfying lives. In the United States, most of our products are marketed directly to doctors, hospitals and other healthcare facilities. In general, we maintain separate dedicated sales forces for each of our principal product lines to provide focus and a high level of expertise to each medical specialty served. Internationally our products are sold in over 100 countries through company-owned sales subsidiaries and branches as well as third-party dealers and distributors. Our business is generally not seasonal in nature; however, the number of Orthopaedics implant surgeries is generally lower during the summer months and sales of capital equipment are generally higher in the fourth quarter.At the heart of what we do and believe is making healthcare better. We do this by collaborating with our customers to develop innovative products and services that ultimately improve the lives of our patients. We express this through our mission statement:""Together with our customers, we are driven to make healthcare better.""We believe our success in the highly competitive product categories in which we operate depends to a large degree on our ability to develop new products and make improvements to existing products. We are committed to internal innovation to develop products and services that improve outcomes and deliver greater cost savings and efficiencies and to augment our efforts with focused acquisitions. Our success further depends on the ability of our people to execute effectively, every day.Our goal is to drive sales growth at the high-end of the MedTech industry and maintain our capital allocation strategy that prioritizes:1.Acquisitions2.Dividends3.Share repurchases Overview of 2014In 2014 we achieved sales growth of 7.3% in line with our ongoing goal to grow organic sales at the high-end of the MedTech industry. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, sales grew 5.8% in constant currency. We converted our sales growth into a 5.3% growth in adjusted net earnings per diluted share (See page 12 for a reconciliation of reported net earnings per diluted share to adjusted net earnings per diluted share). We continued our capital allocation strategy by investing $916 in acquisitions, paying $462 in dividends to our shareholders and using $100 for share repurchases.In November 2014 we entered into a Settlement Agreement to compensate eligible United States patients who had ""revision surgery"" to replace their Rejuvenate Modular-Neck hip stem and/or ABG II Modular-Neck hip stem.In September 2014 we acquired the assets of Small Bone Innovations, Inc. (SBi) for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $358. SBi products are designed and promoted for upper and lower extremity small bone indications, with a focus on small joint replacement. In July 2014 we established a European regional headquarters in the Netherlands. We believe that this increased presence will strengthen our brand in Europe, support the growth of our global business, provide operational efficiencies and simplify our customers’ experience. In April 2014 we acquired Berchtold Holding, AG (Berchtold), a privately-held business with operations in Germany and the United States, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $184. Berchtold sells surgical tables, equipment booms and surgical lighting systems. In March 2014 we acquired Patient Safety Technologies, Inc. (PST), for an aggregate purchase price of $120. PST conducts its business through its wholly owned subsidiary, SurgiCount Medical, Inc. PST’s proprietary Safety-Sponge® System and SurgiCount 360™ compliance software help prevent retained foreign objects in the operating room. Other business acquisitions in 2014 include the acquisition of Pivot Medical, Inc, which develops and sells innovative products for hip arthroscopy.RESULTS OF OPERATIONSConsolidated results of operations:Years Ended December 31, Percentage Change 201420132012 2014/20132013/2012Net Sales$9,675$9,021$8,657 7.34.2Gross Profit6,3846,0445,876 5.62.9Research, development and engineering expenses614536471 14.613.8Selling, general and administrative expenses4,3364,1143,541 5.416.2Intangibles amortization188138123 36.212.2Other income (expense)(86)(44)(36) 95.522.2Income taxes645206407 213.1(49.4)Net Earnings$515$1,006$1,298 (48.8)(22.5)Diluted Net Earnings per share$1.34$2.63$3.39 (49.0)(22.4)Adjusted Net Earnings per share (1)$4.73$4.49$4.30 5.34.49 Dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.STRYKER CORPORATION 2014 Form 10-KGeographic and segment net sales: Percentage Change 2014/2013 2013/2012 Years Ended December 31, ConstantCurrency ConstantCurrency 2014 2013 2012 Reported Reported Geographic sales: United States $6,558 $5,984 $5,658 9.6 9.6 5.8 5.8International 3,117 3,037 2,999 2.6 5.7 1.3 6.0Total net sales $9,675 $9,021 $8,657 7.3 8.3 4.2 5.9Segment sales: Orthopaedics $4,153 $3,949 $3,823 5.2 6.3 3.3 5.4MedSurg 3,781 3,414 3,265 10.8 11.7 4.6 5.5Neurotechnology and Spine 1,741 1,658 1,569 5.0 6.2 5.6 7.7Total net sales $9,675 $9,021 $8,657 7.3 8.3 4.2 5.9Net sales increased 7.3% in 2014. In 2014 net sales grew by 7.8% as a result of increased unit volume and changes in product mix and 2.5% due to acquisitions and were negatively impacted by 2.0% due to changes in price and 1.0% due to the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, net sales increased 5.8% in constant currency. Net sales increased primarily due to higher shipments of instruments products, trauma and extremities products, endoscopy products, neurotechnology products, medical products, and the impact of acquisitions. Net sales increased 4.2% in 2013. In 2013 net sales grew by 6.5% as a result of unit volume and changes in product mix and 0.8% due to acquisitions and were negatively impacted by 1.4% due to changes in price and 1.6% due to the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, 2013 net sales increased 5.1% in constant currency. Net sales increased primarily due to higher shipments of trauma and extremities products, neurotechnology products, hips and endoscopy products. In the United States net sales increased 9.6% in 2014 after increasing 5.8% in 2013. In constant currency, International sales increased 5.7% in 2014 after increasing 6.0% in 2013.

In constant currency, net sales increased by 6.3% in 2014, primarily due to increases in trauma and extremities products and the impact of acquisitions. Net sales in 2013 increased 3.3%, primarily due to a 7.9% increase in unit volume and changes in product mix and 1.4% due to acquisitions. Net sales were negatively impacted by 2.4% due to changes in price and 2.1% due to the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, net sales increased by 5.4% in constant currency in 2013, primarily due to increases in trauma and extremities products and hips.10 Dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.STRYKER CORPORATION 2014 Form 10-KMedSurg Net SalesMedSurg net sales in 2014 increased 10.8%, primarily due to a 9.5% increase in unit volume and changes in product mix and 3.0% due to acquisitions, and were negatively impacted by 0.8% due to changes in price and 0.9% due to the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates. In constant currency, net sales in 2014 increased 11.7%, led by higher shipments of instruments products and medical products and the impact of acquisitions; these higher shipments were partially offset by lower shipments of sustainability products. Net sales in 2013 increased 4.6%, primarily due to a 3.8% increase in unit volume and changes in product mix and were negatively impacted by 0.9% due to the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates. The effect of pricing was not significant. In constant currency, net sales in 2013 increased 5.5%, led by higher shipments of endoscopy products.Neurotechnology and Spine Net SalesNeurotechnology and Spine net sales in 2014 increased 5.0%, primarily due to an 8.1% increase in unit volume and changes in product mix and 0.5% due to acquisitions, and were negatively impacted by 2.4% due to changes in price and 1.2% due to the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates. In constant currency net sales in 2014 increased 6.2% led by higher shipments of neurotechnology products. Net sales in 2013 increased 5.6%, primarily due to an 8.8% increase in unit volume and changes in product mix and 0.9% due to acquisitions, and were negatively impacted by 2.0% due to changes in price and 2.1% due to the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, net sales in 2013 increased 6.8% in constant currency, due to higher shipments of neurotechnology products.Consolidated Cost of SalesCost of sales increased 10.5% in 2014 to 34.0% of sales compared to 33.0% in 2013. Cost of sales as a percentage of sales was adversely impacted by changes in selling prices for our products, unfavorable product mix and by the unfavorable effect of foreign currency exchange rates. Our product mix was unfavorable due to the impact of recent acquisitions and strong MedSurg sales. Cost of sales in 2014 and 2013 includes an additional cost of $27 and $28, respectively, related to inventory that was ""stepped up"" to fair value following acquisitions; $1 and $11, respectively in restructuring related charges; and $7 in 2013 for disgorgement of profits associated with a legal settlement. Cost of sales increased 7.0% in 2013 to 33.0% of sales compared to 32.1% in 2012. Cost of sales in 2012 includes an additional cost of $18 related to inventory that was ""stepped up"" to fair value following acquisitions and $5 in restructuring related costs. Research, Development and Engineering ExpensesResearch, development and engineering expenses represented 6.3% of sales in 2014 compared to 5.9% in 2013 and 5.4% in 2012. The increased spending levels in 2014 and 2013 were driven by the impact of acquisitions and by the timing of projects and our continued investment in new technologies.Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 5.4% in 2014 and represented 44.9% of sales compared to 45.6% in 2013 and 40.9% in 2012, driven by strong sales growth and cost improvement efforts. These expenses included $75 and $70 in 2014 and 2013, respectively, of acquisition and integration related charges; $116 and $52, respectively, of restructuring related charges, $761 and $622, respectively, related to the Rejuvenate, ABG II and Neptune recalls; $62 in 2013 related to regulatory and legal matters; $25 in 2013 representing a donation to an educational institution. Excluding the impact of these charges, selling, general and administrative expenses were 35.0% of sales in 2014 compared to 36.4% in 2013.Other Income (Expense)Other expense increased by $42 in 2014 after increasing by $8 in 2013. Net expense in 2014 increased primarily due to higher interest expense from the $1,000 senior unsecured notes issued in May 2014, partially offset by lower interest expense due to favorable tax audit resolutions. Net expense in 2013 increased due to lower income from interest and marketable securities, offset by hedge gains and lower interest expense. The decrease in interest expense was due to favorable tax audit resolutions in multiple jurisdictions, partially offset by higher interest expense on borrowings. Income TaxesOur effective income tax rate on earnings was 55.6%, 17.0% and 23.9% in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The effective income tax rate for 2014 includes the tax impacts of the establishment of a European regional headquarters and a cash repatriation to the United States planned for 2015. The effective income tax rate for 2013 includes income tax benefits relating to favorable audit resolutions in multiple jurisdictions. The effective income tax rate for 2012 includes the net impact of effective settlement of all tax matters through 2004 relating to two German subsidiaries, and adjustment of the estimate of foreign tax credits to the amount shown on the tax return as filed. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (the Act) was signed on January 2, 2013. The Act provided numerous tax provisions for corporations including an extension of the research tax credit and an extension of certain provisions for companies with significant international operations. The provisions originally expired at December 31, 2011 but were retroactively extended through December 31, 2013. In 2013 we recorded tax benefits of $13 related to the 2012 research tax credit and other provision of the Act.Net EarningsNet earnings in 2014 decreased 48.8% to $515 compared to 2013. Basic net earnings per share in 2014 decreased 48.9% to $1.36, and diluted net earnings per share in 2014 decreased 49.0% to $1.34 compared to 2013, respectively. Foreign currency had a negative impact on our diluted net earnings per share in 2014 of approximately $0.14. Net earnings in 2013 decreased 22.5% to $1,006 compared to 2012. Basic net earnings per share in 2013 decreased 22.0% to $2.66, and diluted net earnings per share in 2013 decreased 22.4% to $2.63 compared to 2012, respectively.Reported net earnings in 2014 includes charges for the Rejuvenate, ABG II and Neptune recalls, acquisition and integration related charges, and additional cost of sales for inventory sold that was ""stepped up"" to fair value related to acquisitions, restructuring related charges and benefits associated with the resolution of certain tax matters. Excluding the impact of these items, adjusted net earnings(1) in 2014 increased 5.6% to $1,810 after increasing 4.0% in 2013. Adjusted diluted net earnings per share(1) in 2014 increased 5.3% to $4.73 after increasing 4.4% in 2013. (1)Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresWe supplement the reporting of our financial information determined under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) with certain non-GAAP financial measures, including percentage sales growth in constant currency; percentage organic sales growth; adjusted gross profit; cost of sales excluding specified items; adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses; adjusted amortization of intangible assets; adjusted operating income; adjusted effective income tax rate; adjusted net earnings; and adjusted diluted net earnings per share (EPS). We believe that 11 Dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.STRYKER CORPORATION 2014 Form 10-Kthese non-GAAP measures provide meaningful information to assist investors and shareholders in understanding our financial results and assessing our prospects for future performance. Management believes percentage sales growth in constant currency and the other adjusted measures described above are important indicators of our operations because they exclude items that may not be indicative of or are unrelated to our core operating results and provide a baseline for analyzing trends in our underlying businesses. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures for reviewing the operating results of reportable business segments and analyzing potential future business trends in connection with our budget process and bases certain management incentive compensation on these non-GAAP financial measures. To measure percentage sales growth in constant currency, we remove the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates that affect the comparability and trend of sales. Percentage sales growth in constant currency is calculated by translating current year results at prior year average foreign currency exchange rates. To measure percentage organic sales growth, we remove the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and acquisitions that affect the comparability and trend of sales. Percentage organic sales growth is calculated by translating current year results at prior year average foreign currency exchange rates excluding the impact of acquisitions. To measure earnings performance on a consistent and comparable basis, we exclude certain items that affect the comparability of operating results and the trend of earnings. These adjustments are irregular in timing, may not be indicative of our past and future performance and are therefore excluded to allow investors to better understand underlying operating trends. The following are examples of the types of adjustments that may be included in a period:1.Acquisition and integration related costs. Costs related to integrating recently acquired businesses and specific costs related to the consummation of the acquisition process.2.Amortization of intangible assets. Periodic amortization expense related to purchased intangible assets. 3.Restructuring related charges. Costs associated with focused workforce reductions, other restructuring activities and long-lived asset impairments.4.Rejuvenate and recall matters. Our best estimate of the minimum of the range of probable loss to resolve certain product recalls.5.Regulatory and legal matters. Our best estimate of the minimum of the range of probable loss to resolve certain regulatory matters and other legal settlements. 6.Tax matters. Certain significant and discrete tax items and adjustments to interest expense related to the settlement of certain tax matters. Because non-GAAP financial measures are not standardized, it may not be possible to compare these financial measures with other companies' non-GAAP financial measures having the same or similar names. These adjusted financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for reported sales growth, gross profit, cost of sales, selling, general and administrative expenses, amortization of intangible assets, operating income, effective income tax rate, net earnings and diluted net earnings per share, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are an additional way of viewing aspects of our operations that, when viewed with our GAAP results and the reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures at the end of the discussion of Results of Operations below, provide a more complete understanding of our business. We strongly encourage investors and shareholders to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure.The following reconciles the non-GAAP financial measures: adjusted gross profit; adjusted selling, general and administrative expense; adjusted operating income; adjusted other income/(expense); adjusted net earnings; adjusted effective tax rate; and adjusted diluted net earnings per share; with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures:Year Ended December 31, 2014Gross ProfitSelling, General & Administrative ExpensesIntangible AmortizationOperating IncomeNet EarningsEffective Tax RateDiluted EPSAS REPORTED$6,384$4,336$188$1,246$51555.6 %$1.34Acquisition and integration related charges Inventory stepped up to fair value27——27150.50.04 Other acquisition and integration related—(75)—75500.70.13Amortization of intangible assets——(188)1881331.10.35Restructuring related charges 1(116)—117781.10.20Rejuvenate and other recall matters —(761)—761628(3.1)1.65Tax matters ————391(33.6)1.02ADJUSTED$6,412$3,384$—$2,414$1,81022.3 %$4.73Year Ended December 31, 2013Gross ProfitSelling, General & Administrative ExpensesIntangible AmortizationOperating IncomeNet EarningsEffective Tax RateDiluted EPSAS REPORTED$6,044$4,114$138$1,256$1,00617.0 %$2.63 Acquisition and integration related charges Inventory stepped up to fair value28——28210.10.06 Other acquisition and integration related—(70)—70510.30.13Amortization of intangible assets——(138)138980.40.26Restructuring related charges 11(52)—63460.30.12Rejuvenate and other recall matters —(622)—6224602.01.20Regulatory and legal matters 7(62)—6963(0.6)0.17Donations—(25)—25150.30.04Tax matters————(46)2.9(0.12)ADJUSTED$6,090$3,283$—$2,271$1,71422.7 %$4.4912 Dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.STRYKER CORPORATION 2014 Form 10-KYear Ended December 31, 2012Gross ProfitSelling General and Administrative ExpensesIntangible AmortizationOperating IncomeNet EarningsEffective Tax RateDiluted EPSAS REPORTED$5,876$3,466$123$1,741$1,29823.9 %$3.39Acquisition and integration related charges Inventory stepped up to fair value18——1813—0.03 Other acquisition and integration related—(37)—37240.30.06Amortization of intangible assets——(123)123880.30.23Restructuring related charges5(75)—80590.10.15Rejuvenate and other recall matters —(174)—174133—0.35Regulatory and legal matters—(33)—3333(0.5)0.09ADJUSTED$5,899$3,147$—$2,206$1,64824.1 %$4.30The weighted-average basic and diluted shares outstanding used in the calculation of these non-GAAP financial measures are the same as the weighted-average shares outstanding used in the calculation of the reported per share amounts.FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITYWe believe our financial condition continues to be of high quality, as evidenced by our ability to generate substantial cash from operations and ready access to capital markets at competitive rates.Operating cash flow provides the primary source of cash to fund operating needs and capital expenditures. Excess operating cash is used first to fund acquisitions to complement our portfolio of businesses. Other discretionary uses include dividends and share repurchases. As necessary, we may supplement operating cash flow with debt to fund these activities. Our overall cash position shows our strong business results and a global cash management strategy that takes into account liquidity management, economic factors and tax considerations.Operating ActivitiesOperating cash flow was $1,782 in 2014, a decrease of 5.5% and resulted primarily from net earnings adjusted for non-cash items (recall charges, depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation, sale of inventory ""stepped up"" to fair value at acquisition and deferred income taxes). In addition, the increase in taxes payable was primarily due to the timing of tax payments associated with tax liabilities arising from the establishment of a European regional headquarters. These increases were partially offset by higher levels of inventory and accounts receivable. The net of accounts receivable, inventory and accounts payable resulted in the consumption of $249 of cash in 2014. Inventory days on hand increased by eight days compared to 2013 as inventory grew to support higher sales and acquisitions, while accounts receivable days sales outstanding decreased by one day compared to 2013.Operating cash flow was $1,886 in 2013, an increase of 13.8%, and resulted primarily from net earnings adjusted for non-cash items (depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation, sale of inventory ""stepped up"" to fair value at acquisition and deferred income taxes), along with a decrease of $278 in cash paid for income taxes, associated with the timing of cash payments as well as favorable tax audit resolutions in multiple jurisdictions. The net of accounts receivable, inventory and accounts payable consumed $165 of cash in 2013. Inventory days on hand improved by 1 day due to continued focus on improved inventory management; accounts receivable days sales outstanding remained consistent with 2012.Investing ActivitiesNet investing activities resulted in cash consumption of $1,878, $2,217 and $736 in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, primarily due to acquisitions and capital spending.Acquisitions. Acquisitions resulted in cash consumption of $916 in 2014 and $2,320 in 2013. In 2014 the cash consumed was primarily for SBi, Berchtold, PST and Pivot. In 2013 cash consumed was primarily for Trauson and MAKO. Cash consumed in 2012 of $154 was primarily associated with the acquisition of Surpass Medical Ltd.Capital Spending. We manage capital spending to support our business growth. Capital expenditures, primarily to support integration of acquisitions, information technology infrastructure upgrades, capacity expansion, new product introductions, innovation and cost savings, were $233, $195 and $210 in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.Financing ActivitiesDividend Payments. Dividends paid per common share increased 15.1% to $1.22 per share in 2014, and increased 24.7% to $1.06 per share in 2013. As a result of the annual increase in dividends paid per share, total dividend payments to common shareholders were $462, $401 and $324 in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.Short-Term and Long-Term Debt. We maintain debt levels we consider appropriate after evaluating a number of factors, including cash flow expectations, cash requirements for ongoing operations, investment and financing plans (including acquisitions and share repurchase activities) and overall cost of capital. Net proceeds from borrowings were $1,159 and $1,005 in 2014 and 2013, respectively. In 2014 the proceeds were primarily from the public offerings of notes and commercial paper, and proceeds in 2013 were primarily from public offerings of notes. Refer to Note 8 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.Total debt was $3,973 and $2,764 in 2014 and 2013, respectively. Share Repurchases. The total use of cash for share repurchases was $100, $317 and $108 in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.LiquidityOur cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $5,000 and $3,980 at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, and our current assets exceeded current liabilities by $5,209 and $5,678 at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. We anticipate being able to support our short-term liquidity and operating needs, including settlements related to the Rejuvenate and ABG II recalls, from a variety of sources, including cash from operations, commercial paper and existing credit lines. In the past we have also raised funds in the capital markets and may continue to do so from time to time in the future. We have strong short-term and long-term debt ratings that we believe should enable us to refinance our debt as it becomes due. Should additional funds be required we had approximately $1,289 of borrowing capacity available under all of our existing credit facilities at December 31, 2014.At December 31, 2014, approximately 68% of our consolidated cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were held outside of the United States. During the third quarter of 2014 we announced 13 Dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.STRYKER CORPORATION 2014 Form 10-Kthat we plan to repatriate approximately $2,000 in total of cash from outside of the United States in 2015. The remainder of the funds outside of the United States are considered indefinitely reinvested to be used to expand operations either organically or through acquisitions outside the United States.We continually evaluate our receivables, particularly in Spain, Portugal, Italy and Greece (the Southern European Region). The total net receivables from the Southern European Region were approximately $154 and $199 at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, including approximately $78 and $103 of sovereign receivables in 2014 and 2013, respectively. We believe that our current reserves related to receivables are adequate and any additional credit risk associated with the Southern European Region is not expected to have a material adverse impact on our financial position or liquidity. We currently do not have any investments in the sovereign debt instruments of the Southern European Region. Any non-sovereign exposure in these countries in our investment portfolio is considered immaterial. Guarantees and Other Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsWe do not have guarantees or other off-balance sheet financing arrangements, including variable interest entities, of a magnitude that we believe could have a material impact on our financial condition or liquidity.CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND FORWARD-LOOKING CASH REQUIREMENTSAs further described in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, as of December 31, 2014 we have recorded charges to earnings totaling $748 representing the minimum of the range of probable loss to resolve the Rejuvenate and ABG II recalls. Based on the information that has been received, the actuarially determined range of probable loss to resolve this matter is estimated to be approximately $1,534 ($1,713 before $179 of third-party insurance recoveries) to $2,453. The final outcome of this matter is dependent on many variables that are difficult to predict. The ultimate cost to entirely resolve this matter may be materially different than the amount of the current estimate and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. We are not able to reasonably estimate the future periods in which payments will be made.As further described in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, as of December 31, 2014 our defined benefit pension plans were underfunded by $260, of which approximately $250 related to plans outside the United States. Due to the rules affecting tax-deductible contributions in the jurisdictions in which the plans are offered and the impact of future plan asset performance, changes in interest rates and potential changes in legislation in the United States and other foreign jurisdictions, we are not able to reasonably estimate, beyond 2014, the amounts that may be required to fund defined benefit pension plans. As further described in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, as of December 31, 2014 we have recorded a liability for uncertain income tax positions of $315. Due to uncertainties regarding the ultimate resolution of income tax audits, we are not able to reasonably estimate the future periods in which any income tax payments to settle these uncertain income tax positions will be made.Our future contractual obligations for agreements with initial terms greater than one year, including agreements to purchase materials in the normal course of business, are: Payment Period Total Less than 1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years After 5 years Short-term and long-term debt$3,979 $727 $750 $600 $1,902 Unconditional purchase obligations1,056 697 238 120 1 Operating leases216 60 78 44 34 Contributions to defined benefit plans19 19 — — — Other94 13 17 9 55 $5,364 $1,516 $1,083 $773 $1,992 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATESIn preparing our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, there are certain accounting policies that may require a choice between acceptable accounting methods or may require substantial judgment or estimation in their application. These include inventory reserves, income taxes, acquisitions, goodwill and intangible assets, and legal and other contingencies. We believe these accounting policies and the others set forth in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements should be reviewed as they are integral to understanding our results of operations and financial condition. Inventory ReservesWe maintain reserves for excess and obsolete inventory resulting from the potential inability to sell certain products at prices in excess of current carrying costs. We make estimates regarding the future recoverability of the costs of these products and record provisions based on historical experience, expiration of sterilization dates and expected future trends. If actual product life cycles, product demand or acceptance of new product introductions are less favorable than projected by management, additional inventory write downs may be required, which could unfavorably affect future operating results.Income TaxesOur annual tax rate is determined based on our income, statutory tax rates and the tax impacts of items treated differently for tax purposes than for financial reporting purposes. Tax law requires certain items be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return, and some differences are temporary and reverse over time, such as depreciation expense. These temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent the tax effect of items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in our income statement. Deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in our financial statements for which payment has been deferred, the tax effect of expenditures for which a deduction has already been taken in our tax return but has not yet been recognized in our financial statements or assets recorded at fair value in business combinations for which there was no corresponding tax basis adjustment. Inherent in determining our annual tax rate are judgments regarding business plans, tax planning opportunities and expectations about future outcomes. Realization of certain deferred tax assets is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction prior to the expiration of the carryforward periods. Although realization is not assured, management believes it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances, will be realized. 14 Dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.STRYKER CORPORATION 2014 Form 10-KWe operate in multiple jurisdictions with complex tax policy and regulatory environments. In certain of these jurisdictions, we may take tax positions that management believes are supportable but are potentially subject to successful challenge by the applicable taxing authority. These differences of interpretation with the respective governmental taxing authorities can be impacted by the local economic and fiscal environment. We evaluate our tax positions and establish liabilities in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance on uncertainty in income taxes. We review these tax uncertainties in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of tax audits, and adjust them accordingly. We have a number of audits in process in various jurisdictions. Although the resolution of these tax positions is uncertain, based on currently available information, we believe that it is more likely than not that the ultimate outcomes will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Because there are a number of estimates and assumptions inherent in calculating the various components of our tax provision, certain changes or future events, such as changes in tax legislation, geographic mix of earnings, completion of tax audits or earnings repatriation plans, could have an impact on those estimates and our effective tax rate.Acquisitions, Goodwill and Intangibles, and Long-Lived AssetsWe account for acquired businesses using the purchase method of accounting. Under the purchase method, our financial statements include the operations of an acquired business starting from the completion of the acquisition. In addition, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective estimated fair values, with any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired recorded as goodwill. Significant judgment is required in estimating the fair value of intangible assets and in assigning their respective useful lives. Accordingly, we typically obtain the assistance of third-party valuation specialists for significant items. The fair value estimates are based on available historical information and on future expectations and assumptions deemed reasonable by management but are inherently uncertain. We typically use an income method to estimate the fair value of intangible assets, which is based on forecasts of the expected future cash flows attributable to the respective assets. Significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the valuations reflect a consideration of other marketplace participants and include the amount and timing of future cash flows (including expected growth rates and profitability), the underlying product or technology life cycles, the economic barriers to entry and the discount rate applied to the cash flows. Unanticipated market or macroeconomic events and circumstances may occur that could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and assumptions. Determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment. With the exception of certain trade names, the majority of our acquired intangible assets (e.g., certain trademarks or brands, customer and distributor relationships, patents and technologies) are expected to have determinable useful lives. Our assessment as to the useful lives of these intangible assets is based on a number of factors including competitive environment, market share, trademark and/or brand history, underlying product life cycles, operating plans and the macroeconomic environment of the countries in which the trademarks or brands are sold. Our estimates of the useful lives of determinable-lived intangibles are primarily based on these same factors. Determinable-lived intangible assets are amortized to expense over their estimated useful life. In certain of our acquisitions, we acquire in-process research and development (IPRD) intangible assets. IPRD is considered to be an indefinite-lived intangible asset until such time as the research is completed (at which time it becomes a determinable-lived intangible asset) or determined to have no future use (at which time it is impaired). The value of indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill is not amortized but is tested at least annually for impairment. Our impairment testing for goodwill is performed separately from our impairment testing of indefinite-lived intangibles. We perform our annual impairment test for goodwill in the fourth quarter of each year. We have adopted the provisions of Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2011-08, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other: Testing Goodwill for Impairment, which permits us to consider qualitative indicators of the fair value of a reporting unit when it is unlikely that a reporting unit has impaired goodwill. In certain circumstances, we may also utilize a discounted cash flow analysis that requires certain assumptions and estimates be made regarding market conditions and our future profitability. In those circumstances we test goodwill for impairment by reviewing the book value compared to the fair value at the reporting unit level. We test individual indefinite-lived intangibles by reviewing the individual book values compared to the fair value. We determine the fair value of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets based on the income approach. Under the income approach, we calculate the fair value of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. Considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating and macroeconomic changes and to estimate future cash flows to measure fair value. Assumptions used in our impairment evaluations, such as forecasted growth rates and cost of capital, are consistent with internal projections and operating plans. We believe such assumptions and estimates are also comparable to those that would be used by other marketplace participants. We did not recognize any impairment charges for goodwill during the years presented, as our annual impairment testing indicated that all reporting unit goodwill fair values exceeded their respective recorded values. Future changes in the judgments, assumptions and estimates that are used in our impairment testing for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, including discount and tax rates and future cash flow projections, could result in significantly different estimates of the fair values. A significant reduction in the estimated fair values could result in impairment charges that could materially affect our financial statements.We review our other long-lived assets for indicators of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The evaluation is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, which is at the individual asset level or the asset group level. The undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the related assets are estimated over their useful life based on updated projections. If the evaluation indicates that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable, any potential impairment is measured based upon the fair value of the related assets or asset group as determined by an appropriate market appraisal or other valuation technique. Assets classified as held for sale, if any, are recorded at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell. Legal and Other ContingenciesWe are involved in various ongoing proceedings, legal actions and claims arising in the normal course of business, including proceedings related to product, labor and intellectual property, and other matters that are more fully described in Note 7 to the 15 Dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.STRYKER CORPORATION 2014 Form 10-KConsolidated Financial Statements. The outcomes of these matters will generally not be known for prolonged periods of time. In certain of the legal proceedings, the claimants seek damages, as well as other compensatory and equitable relief, that could result in the payment of significant claims and settlements and/or the imposition of injunctions or other equitable relief. For legal matters for which management has sufficient information to reasonably estimate our future obligations, a liability representing management's best estimate of the probable loss, or the minimum of the range of probable losses when a best estimate within the range is not known, for the resolution of these legal matters is recorded. The estimates are based on consultation with legal counsel, previous settlement experience and settlement strategies. If actual outcomes are less favorable than those projected by management, additional expense may be incurred, which could unfavorably affect future operating results. We are currently self-insured for product liability-related claims and expenses. The ultimate cost to us with respect to product liability claims could be materially different than the amount of the current estimates and accruals and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTSIn May 2014 the FASB issued Accounting Standard Update (ASU) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which supersedes and replaces nearly all currently-existing guidance under United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles related to revenue recognition including related disclosure requirements. This guidance will be effective for us beginning January 1, 2017. We have not yet completed an assessment of the impact that adoption of this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements.OTHER INFORMATIONHedging and Derivative Financial InstrumentsWe sell our products throughout the world. As a result, our financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as weak economic conditions or changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Our operating results are primarily exposed to changes in exchange rates among the United States dollar; European currencies, in particular the euro, Swiss franc and the British pound; the Japanese yen; the Australian dollar; and the Canadian dollar. We develop and manufacture products in the United States, China, France, Germany, Ireland, Puerto Rico and Switzerland and incur costs in the applicable local currencies. This worldwide deployment of facilities serves to partially mitigate the impact of currency exchange rate changes on our cost of sales.We enter into designated and non-designated forward currency exchange contracts to mitigate the impact of currency fluctuations on transactions denominated in nonfunctional currencies, thereby limiting risk that would otherwise result from changes in exchange rates. These nonfunctional currency exposures principally relate to intercompany receivables and payables arising from intercompany purchases of manufactured products. The periods of the forward currency exchange contracts correspond to the periods of the exposed transactions, with realized gains and losses included in the measurement and recording of transactions denominated in the nonfunctional currencies. All forward currency exchange contracts are recorded at their fair value each period, with resulting gains (losses) for non-designated forward contracts and any ineffectiveness measured on designated forward currency exchange contracts included in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income, and reclassified into earnings in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings.The estimated fair value of forward currency exchange contracts represents the measurement of the contracts at month-end spot rates as adjusted by current forward points. A hypothetical 10% change in foreign currencies relative to the United States dollar would change the December 31, 2014 fair value by approximately $79. We are exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties on our outstanding forward currency exchange contracts, but we do not anticipate nonperformance by any of our counterparties.We have certain investments in net assets in international locations that are not hedged. These investments are subject to translation gains and losses due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. For 2014 the strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the United States dollar increased the value of these investments in net assets and the related foreign currency translation adjustment loss in shareholders' equity by $(440) to $(134), from $306 as of December 31, 2013.ITEM 7A.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKWe consider our material area of market risk exposure to be exchange rate risk.

We offer a diverse array of innovative medical technologies, including reconstructive, medical and surgical, and neurotechnology and spine products to help people lead more active and more satisfying lives. In the United States most of our products are marketed directly to doctors, hospitals and other healthcare facilities. We generally maintain separate dedicated sales forces for each of our principal product lines to provide focus and a high level of expertise to each medical specialty served. Our products are sold in approximately 100 countries through company-owned sales subsidiaries and branches as well as third-party dealers and distributors. Our business is generally not seasonal in nature; however, the number of orthopaedic implant surgeries is typically lower during the summer months and sales of capital equipment are generally higher in the fourth quarter.Making healthcare better is at the heart of what we do. We do this by collaborating with our customers to develop innovative products and services that ultimately improve patients' lives. We express this through our mission statement:""Together with our customers, we are driven to make healthcare better.""We believe our success in the highly competitive product categories in which we operate depends on our ability to develop new products and make improvements to existing products. We are committed to internal innovation to develop products and services that improve outcomes and deliver greater cost savings and efficiencies and to augment our efforts with focused acquisitions. Our success further depends on the ability of our people to execute effectively, every day. Our goal is to achieve sales growth at the high-end of the medical technology industry (MedTech) industry and maintain our capital allocation strategy that prioritizes:1.Acquisitions2.Dividends3.Share repurchasesOverview of 2015In 2015 we achieved sales growth of 2.8% in line with our ongoing goal to grow organic sales at the high-end of MedTech. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, sales grew 6.1% in constant currency. We reported net earnings per diluted share of $3.78 in 2015 and achieved an 8.2% growth in adjusted net earnings per diluted share (See page 12 for a reconciliation of reported net earnings per diluted share to adjusted net earnings per diluted share). We continued our capital allocation strategy by investing $153 in acquisitions, paying $521 in dividends to our shareholders and using $700 for share repurchases.In 2015 we acquired CHG Hospital Beds, Inc. (""CHG""). CHG designs, manufactures and markets low-height hospital beds and related accessories. Recent DevelopmentsOn January 26, 2016 we announced that William R. Jellison has elected to retire from his role as Vice President, Chief Financial Officer effective April 1, 2016. Glenn S. Boehnlein, who currently serves as Group Vice President, Chief Financial Officer for MedSurg & Neurotechnology, has been promoted to Vice President, Chief Financial Officer effective April 1, 2016. On February 1, 2016 we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Sage Products, LLC (Sage) in an all cash transaction for $2,775. Sage develops, manufactures and distributes disposable products targeted at reducing ""Never Events,"" primarily in the intensive care unit and MedSurg hospital unit setting. Sage’s products include solutions for oral care, skin preparation and protection, patient cleaning and hygiene, turning and positioning devices and heel care boots. This transaction is expected to close during the second quarter of 2016.

We believe that these non-GAAP measures provide meaningful information to assist investors and shareholders in understanding our financial results and assessing our prospects for future performance. Management believes percentage sales growth in constant currency and the other adjusted measures described above are important indicators of our operations because they exclude items that may not be indicative of or are unrelated to our core operating results and provide a baseline for analyzing trends in our underlying businesses. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures for reviewing the operating results of reportable business segments and analyzing potential future business trends in connection with our budget process and bases certain management incentive compensation on these non-GAAP financial measures. To measure percentage sales growth in constant currency, we remove the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates that affect the comparability and trend of sales. Percentage sales growth in constant currency is calculated by translating current year results at prior year average foreign currency exchange rates. To measure percentage organic sales growth, we remove the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and acquisitions that affect the comparability and trend of sales. Percentage organic sales growth is calculated by translating current year results at prior year average foreign currency exchange rates excluding the impact of acquisitions. To measure earnings performance on a consistent and comparable basis, we exclude certain items that affect the comparability of operating results and the trend of earnings. These adjustments are irregular in timing, may not be indicative of our past and future performance and are therefore excluded to allow investors to better understand underlying operating trends. The following are examples of the types of adjustments that may be included in a period:1.Acquisition and integration related costs. Costs related to integrating recently acquired businesses and specific costs related to the consummation of the acquisition process.2.Amortization of intangible assets. Periodic amortization expense related to purchased intangible assets. 3.Restructuring-related charges. Costs associated with workforce reductions, facility rationalizations and other restructuring activities.4.Recall matters. Our best estimate of the minimum of the range of probable loss to resolve certain product recalls.5.Regulatory and legal matters. Our best estimate of the minimum of the range of probable loss to resolve certain regulatory matters and other legal settlements. 6.Tax matters. Certain significant and discrete tax items and adjustments to interest expense related to the settlement of certain tax matters. Because non-GAAP financial measures are not standardized, it may not be possible to compare these financial measures with other companies' non-GAAP financial measures having the same or similar names. These adjusted financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for reported sales growth, gross profit, cost of sales, selling, general and administrative expenses, amortization of intangible assets, operating income, effective income tax rate, net earnings and net earnings per diluted share, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are an additional way of viewing aspects of our operations that, when viewed with our GAAP results and the reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures below provide a more complete understanding of our business. We strongly encourage investors and shareholders to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure.The following reconciles the non-GAAP financial measures: adjusted gross profit; adjusted selling, general and administrative expense; adjusted operating income; adjusted other income (expense), net; adjusted net earnings; adjusted effective tax rate; and adjusted diluted EPS; with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures:Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures to the Most Directly Comparable GAAP Financial Measures2015Gross ProfitSelling, General & Administrative ExpensesIntangible AmortizationOperating IncomeNet EarningsEffective Tax RateDiluted EPSAS REPORTED$6,602$3,610$210$1,861$1,43917.1 %$3.78Acquisition and integration-related charges Inventory stepped up to fair value7——740.10.01 Other acquisition and integration-related—(28)—28200.20.05Amortization of intangible assets——(210)2101471.50.39Restructuring-related charges 7(125)—132970.70.26Rejuvenate and other recall matters ———2962102.00.55 Regulatory and legal matters —53—(53)(46)0.1(0.12)Tax matters ————78(4.4)0.20ADJUSTED$6,616$3,510$—$2,481$1,94917.3 %$5.1212 Dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.STRYKER CORPORATION 2015 Form 10-K2014Gross ProfitSelling, General & Administrative ExpensesIntangible AmortizationOperating IncomeNet EarningsEffective Tax RateDiluted EPSAS REPORTED$6,356$3,547$188$1,246$51555.6 %$1.34Acquisition and integration-related charges Inventory stepped up to fair value27——27150.50.04 Other acquisition and integration-related—(75)—75500.70.13Amortization of intangible assets——(188)1881331.10.35Restructuring-related charges 1(116)—117781.10.20Rejuvenate and other recall matters ———761628(3.1)1.65Tax matters————391(33.6)1.02ADJUSTED$6,384$3,356$—$2,414$1,81022.3 %$4.732013Gross ProfitSelling General and Administrative ExpensesIntangible AmortizationOperating IncomeNet EarningsEffective Tax RateDiluted EPSAS REPORTED$6,019$3,467$138$1,256$1,00617.0 %$2.63Acquisition and integration related charges Inventory stepped up to fair value28——28210.10.06 Other acquisition and integration related—(70)—70510.30.13Amortization of intangible assets——(138)138980.40.26Restructuring-related charges11(52)—63460.30.12Rejuvenate and other recall matters ———6224602.01.20Regulatory and legal matters7(62)—6963(0.6)0.17 Donations—(25)—25150.30.04 Tax matters ————(46)2.9(0.12)ADJUSTED$6,065$3,258$—$2,271$1,71422.7 %$4.49The weighted-average basic and diluted shares outstanding used in the calculation of non-GAAP Diluted EPS are the same as the weighted-average basic and diluted shares outstanding used in the calculation of the reported Diluted EPS.FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY 201520142013Net cash provided by operations activities$899$1,782$1,886Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities1,956(1,878)(2,217)Net cash (used in) provided financing activities(1,141)629300Effect of exchange rate changes(130)(77)(25)Change in cash and cash equivalents$1,584$456$(56)We believe our financial condition continues to be of high quality, as evidenced by our ability to generate substantial cash from operations and ready access to capital markets at competitive rates.Operating cash flow provides the primary source of cash to fund operating needs and capital expenditures. Excess operating cash is used first to fund acquisitions to complement our portfolio of businesses. Other discretionary uses include dividends and share repurchases. As necessary, we may supplement operating cash flow with debt to fund these activities. Our overall cash position shows our strong business results and a global cash management strategy that takes into account liquidity management, economic factors and tax considerations.Operating ActivitiesCash provided by operations was $899, $1,782, $1,886 in 2015, 2014 and 2013. The decrease in 2015 was primarily due to recall-related payments associated with the Rejuvenate and ABGII recall settlement agreement and the timing of income tax payments.The net of accounts receivable, inventory and accounts payable resulted in the consumption of $231, $249, and $165 of cash in 2015, 2014 and 2013. Inventory days on hand for 2015 increased by 5 days from 2014 after increasing eight days in 2014. Accounts receivable days sales outstanding for 2015 increased by one day after decreasing one day in 2014. Investing ActivitiesCash provided by investing activities was $1,956 in 2015 compared to cash used in investing of $1,878 in 2014 and $2,217 in 2013. This change is primarily due to the sale of a portion of our marketable securities in 2015 to make recall-related payments discussed above under Operating Activities.Acquisitions: Acquisitions resulted in cash consumption of $153, $916 and $2,320 in 2015, 2014 and 2013. In 2015 the primary acquisition was CHG, and in 2014 the primary acquisitions were Patient Safety Technologies, Inc., Pivot Medical Inc., Berchtold Holding, AG and Small Bone Innovations, Inc. In 2013 we acquired Trauson Holdings Company Limited and Mako Surgical Corp.Capital Expenditures: Capital expenditures were $270, $233 and $195 in 2015, 2014 and 2013. Capital expenditures in 2015 were primarily related to acquisition integration support, information technology infrastructure upgrades, capacity expansion, new product introductions, innovation and cost savings.Financing ActivitiesDividends Paid: Dividends paid per common share increased 9.8% to $1.34 per share in 2015 compared to $1.22 per share in 2014, an increase of 15.1% from 2013. Dividends paid per common share and total dividends paid to common shareholders are included in the following table for 2015, 2014 and 2013. 201520142013Dividends paid per common share$1.34$1.22$1.06Total dividends paid to common shareholders$521$462$401Short-Term and Long-Term Debt: We maintain debt levels we consider appropriate after evaluating a number of factors, including cash flow expectations, cash requirements for ongoing operations, investment and financing plans (including acquisitions and share repurchase activities) and overall cost of capital. 13 Dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.STRYKER CORPORATION 2015 Form 10-KNet proceeds from borrowings were $48, $1,159 and $1,005 in 2015, 2014 and 2013. In 2015 the proceeds were primarily from the public offerings of notes offset by the payment of certain notes due and paid in January 2015. Proceeds in 2014 were primarily from the public offerings of notes and commercial paper. Refer to Note 9 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. Total debt was $4,022 and $3,973 in 2015 and 2014. Share Repurchases: The total use of cash for share repurchases was $700, $100 and $317 in 2015, 2014 and 2013. We have decided to suspend our share repurchase program through 2016.LiquidityCash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $4,079 and $5,000 on December 31, 2015 and 2014 and our current assets exceeded current liabilities by $4,441 and $4,223 on December 31, 2015 and 2014. We anticipate being able to support our short-term liquidity and operating needs, including recall-related payments related to the Rejuvenate and ABG II recalls, from a variety of sources, including cash from operations, commercial paper and existing credit lines. We have raised funds in the capital markets and may continue to do so from time to time. We have strong short-term and long-term debt ratings that we believe should enable us to refinance our debt as it becomes due. We have existing credit facilities should additional funds be required. On December 31, 2015 we had approximately $1,236 of borrowing capacity available under our existing credit facilities.On December 31, 2015 approximately 46% of our consolidated cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were held in locations outside the United States. In 2014 we announced that we would begin a repatriation program. We completed the program in 2015 and repatriated approximately $1.8 billion to the United States. Our remaining cash held outside the United States is considered to be indefinitely reinvested. We intend to use this cash to expand operations, either organically or through acquisitions outside the United States.We continually evaluate our receivables, particularly in Spain, Portugal, Italy and Greece (the Southern European Region). The total net receivables from the Southern European Region were approximately $132 and $154 in 2015 and 2014, including approximately $51 and $78 of sovereign receivables in 2015 and 2014. We believe that our current reserves related to receivables are adequate and any additional credit risk associated with the Southern European Region is not expected to have a material adverse impact on our financial position or liquidity. We currently do not have any investments in the sovereign debt instruments of the Southern European Region. Any non-sovereign exposure in these countries is considered immaterial. In 2015 we made recall-related payments of $1,202 under our United States Rejuvenate and ABG II settlement agreement. Refer to Note 8 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.Guarantees and Other Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsWe do not have guarantees or other off-balance sheet financing arrangements, including variable interest entities, of a magnitude that we believe could have a material impact on our financial condition or liquidity.CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND FORWARD-LOOKING CASH REQUIREMENTSAs further described in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, in 2015 we recorded additional charges to earnings totaling $295 related to the Rejuvenate and ABG II recalls. Based on the information that has been received, the actuarially determined range of probable loss to resolve this matter is estimated to be approximately $1,824 ($2,056 before $232 of third-party insurance recoveries) to $2,416. The final outcome of this matter is dependent on many variables that are difficult to predict. The ultimate cost to entirely resolve this matter may be materially different than the amount of the current estimate and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. We are not able to reasonably estimate the future periods in which payments will be made.As further described in Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, on December 31, 2015 we have recorded a liability for uncertain income tax positions of $313. Due to uncertainties regarding the ultimate resolution of income tax audits, we are not able to reasonably estimate the future periods in which any income tax payments to settle these uncertain income tax positions will be made.As further described in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, on December 31, 2015 our defined benefit pension plans were underfunded by $240, of which approximately $231 related to plans outside the United States. Due to the rules affecting tax-deductible contributions in the jurisdictions in which the plans are offered and the impact of future plan asset performance, changes in interest rates and potential changes in legislation in the United States and other foreign jurisdictions, we are not able to reasonably estimate beyond 2016 the amounts that may be required to fund defined benefit pension plans.

These include inventory reserves, income taxes, acquisitions, goodwill and intangible assets, and legal and other contingencies. We believe these accounting policies and the others set forth in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements should be reviewed as they are integral to understanding our results of operations and financial condition. Inventory ReservesWe maintain reserves for excess and obsolete inventory resulting from the potential inability to sell certain products at prices in excess of current carrying costs. We make estimates regarding the future recoverability of the costs of these products and record provisions based on historical experience, expiration of sterilization dates and expected future trends. If actual product life cycles, product demand or acceptance of new product introductions are less favorable than projected by management, additional inventory write downs may be required, which could unfavorably affect future operating results.14 Dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.STRYKER CORPORATION 2015 Form 10-KIncome TaxesOur annual tax rate is determined based on our income, statutory tax rates and the tax impacts of items treated differently for tax purposes than for financial reporting purposes. Tax law requires certain items be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return, and some differences are temporary and reverse over time, such as depreciation expense. These temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities.Deferred tax assets generally represent the tax effect of items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in our income statement. Deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in our financial statements for which payment has been deferred, the tax effect of expenditures for which a deduction has already been taken in our tax return but has not yet been recognized in our financial statements or assets recorded at fair value in business combinations for which there was no corresponding tax basis adjustment.Inherent in determining our annual tax rate are judgments regarding business plans, tax planning opportunities and expectations about future outcomes. Realization of certain deferred tax assets is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction prior to the expiration of the carryforward periods. Although realization is not assured, management believes it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances, will be realized.We operate in multiple jurisdictions with complex tax policy and regulatory environments. In certain of these jurisdictions, we may take tax positions that management believes are supportable but are potentially subject to successful challenge by the applicable taxing authority. These differences of interpretation with the respective governmental taxing authorities can be impacted by the local economic and fiscal environment. We evaluate our tax positions and establish liabilities in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance on uncertainty in income taxes. We review these tax uncertainties in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of tax audits, and adjust them accordingly. We have a number of audits in process in various jurisdictions. Although the resolution of these tax positions is uncertain, based on currently available information, we believe that it is more likely than not that the ultimate outcomes will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.Because there are a number of estimates and assumptions inherent in calculating the various components of our tax provision, certain changes or future events, such as changes in tax legislation, geographic mix of earnings, completion of tax audits or earnings repatriation plans, could have an impact on those estimates and our effective tax rate.Acquisitions, Goodwill and Intangibles, and Long-Lived AssetsWe account for acquired businesses using the purchase method of accounting. Under the purchase method, our financial statements include the operations of an acquired business starting from the completion of the acquisition. In addition, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded on the date of acquisition at their respective estimated fair values, with any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired recorded as goodwill. Significant judgment is required in estimating the fair value of intangible assets and in assigning their respective useful lives. Accordingly, we typically obtain the assistance of third-party valuation specialists for significant items. The fair value estimates are based on available historical information and on future expectations and assumptions deemed reasonable by management but are inherently uncertain. We typically use an income method to estimate the fair value of intangible assets, which is based on forecasts of the expected future cash flows attributable to the respective assets. Significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the valuations reflect a consideration of other marketplace participants and include the amount and timing of future cash flows (including expected growth rates and profitability), the underlying product or technology life cycles, the economic barriers to entry and the discount rate applied to the cash flows. Unanticipated market or macroeconomic events and circumstances may occur that could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and assumptions. Determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment. With the exception of certain trade names, the majority of our acquired intangible assets (e.g., certain trademarks or brands, customer and distributor relationships, patents and technologies) are expected to have determinable useful lives. Our assessment as to the useful lives of these intangible assets is based on a number of factors including competitive environment, market share, trademark and/or brand history, underlying product life cycles, operating plans and the macroeconomic environment of the countries in which the trademarks or brands are sold. Our estimates of the useful lives of determinable-lived intangibles are primarily based on these same factors. Determinable-lived intangible assets are amortized to expense over their estimated useful life. In certain of our acquisitions, we acquire in-process research and development (IPRD) intangible assets. IPRD is considered to be an indefinite-lived intangible asset until such time as the research is completed (at which time it becomes a determinable-lived intangible asset) or determined to have no future use (at which time it is impaired). The value of indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill is not amortized but is tested at least annually for impairment. Our impairment testing for goodwill is performed separately from our impairment testing of indefinite-lived intangibles. We perform our annual impairment test for goodwill in the fourth quarter of each year. We consider qualitative indicators of the fair value of a reporting unit when it is unlikely that a reporting unit has impaired goodwill. In certain circumstances, we may also utilize a discounted cash flow analysis that requires certain assumptions and estimates be made regarding market conditions and our future profitability. In those circumstances we test goodwill for impairment by reviewing the book value compared to the fair value at the reporting unit level. We test individual indefinite-lived intangibles by reviewing the individual book values compared to the fair value. We determine the fair value of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets based on the income approach. Under the income approach, we calculate the fair value of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. Considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating and macroeconomic changes and to estimate future cash flows to measure fair value. Assumptions used in our impairment evaluations, such as forecasted growth rates and cost of capital, are consistent with internal projections and operating plans. We believe such assumptions and estimates are also comparable to those that would be used by other marketplace participants. We did not recognize any impairment charges for goodwill during the years presented, as our annual impairment testing indicated that all reporting unit goodwill fair values exceeded their respective recorded values. Future changes in the judgments, assumptions 15 Dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.STRYKER CORPORATION 2015 Form 10-Kand estimates that are used in our impairment testing for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, including discount and tax rates and future cash flow projections, could result in significantly different estimates of the fair values. A significant reduction in the estimated fair values could result in impairment charges that could materially affect our financial statements.We review our other long-lived assets for indicators of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The evaluation is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, which is at the individual asset level or the asset group level. The undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the related assets are estimated over their useful life based on updated projections. If the evaluation indicates that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable, any potential impairment is measured based upon the fair value of the related assets or asset group as determined by an appropriate market appraisal or other valuation technique. Assets classified as held for sale, if any, are recorded at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell. Legal and Other ContingenciesWe are involved in various ongoing proceedings, legal actions and claims arising in the normal course of business, including proceedings related to product, labor and intellectual property, and other matters that are more fully described in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The outcomes of these matters will generally not be known for prolonged periods of time. In certain of the legal proceedings, the claimants seek damages, as well as other compensatory and equitable relief, that could result in the payment of significant claims and settlements and/or the imposition of injunctions or other equitable relief. For legal matters for which management has sufficient information to reasonably estimate our future obligations, a liability representing management's best estimate of the probable loss, or the minimum of the range of probable losses when a best estimate within the range is not known, for the resolution of these legal matters is recorded. The estimates are based on consultation with legal counsel, previous settlement experience and settlement strategies. If actual outcomes are less favorable than those projected by management, additional expense may be incurred, which could unfavorably affect future operating results. We are currently self-insured for product liability-related claims and expenses. The ultimate cost to us with respect to product liability claims could be materially different than the amount of the current estimates and accruals and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTSRefer to Note 1 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.OTHER INFORMATIONHedging and Derivative Financial InstrumentsWe sell our products globally, as a result, our financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as weak economic conditions or changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Our operating results are primarily exposed to changes in exchange rates among the United States dollar; European currencies, in particular the euro, Swiss franc and the British pound; the Japanese yen; the Australian dollar; and the Canadian dollar. We develop and manufacture products in the United States, Canada, Turkey, China, France, Germany, Ireland, Puerto Rico and Switzerland and incur costs in the applicable local currencies. This global deployment of facilities serves to partially mitigate the impact of currency exchange rate changes on our cost of sales. We enter into designated and non-designated forward currency exchange contracts to mitigate the impact of currency fluctuations on transactions denominated in nonfunctional currencies, thereby limiting risk that would otherwise result from changes in exchange rates. These nonfunctional currency exposures principally relate to intercompany receivables and payables arising from intercompany purchases of manufactured products. The periods of the forward currency exchange contracts correspond to the periods of the exposed transactions, with realized gains and losses included in the measurement and recording of transactions denominated in the nonfunctional currencies. All forward currency exchange contracts are recorded at their fair value each period, with resulting gains (losses) for non-designated forward contracts and any ineffectiveness measured on designated forward currency exchange contracts included in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income, and reclassified into earnings in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings.We have designated certain long-term intercompany loans payable and forward exchange contracts as net investment hedges of our investments in certain international subsidiaries that use the Euro as their functional currency. The effective portion of derivatives designated as net investment hedges are recorded at fair value at each balance sheet date and the change in fair value is recorded as a component of other comprehensive income. The estimated fair value of forward currency exchange contracts represents the measurement of the contracts at month-end spot rates as adjusted by current forward points. A hypothetical 10% change in foreign currencies relative to the United States dollar would change the December 31, 2015 fair value by approximately $178. We are exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties on our outstanding forward currency exchange contracts, but we do not anticipate nonperformance by any of our counterparties.We have certain investments in net assets in international locations that are not hedged. These investments are subject to translation gains and losses due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. For 2015 the weakening of foreign currencies relative to the United States dollar decreased the value of these investments in net assets and increased the related foreign currency translation adjustment loss in shareholders' equity by ($390).

Excluding the 7.9% impact of acquisitions, net sales increased in constant currency by 7.8% from increased unit volume partially offset by 1.4% lower prices. The unit volume increase was primarily due to higher shipments of knees, instruments, endoscopy, neurotechnology, trauma and extremities and medical products. Consolidated net sales in 2015 increased 2.8% as reported and 7.0% in constant currency, as foreign currency exchange rates negatively impacted net sales by 4.2%. Excluding the 0.9% impact of acquisitions, net sales increased in constant currency by 7.6% from increased unit volume partially offset by 1.6% lower prices. The unit volume increase was led primarily by higher shipments of neurotechnology, trauma and extremities, medical and instruments products.Orthopaedics Net SalesOrthopaedics net sales in 2016 increased 4.7% as reported and 5.1% in constant currency, as foreign currency exchange rates negatively impacted net sales by 0.4%. Excluding the 0.3% impact of acquisitions, net sales increased in constant currency by 6.9% from increased unit volume partially offset by 2.1% lower prices. The unit volume increase was led primarily by higher shipments of knees and trauma and extremities products. Orthopaedics net sales in 2015 increased 1.7% as reported and 6.7% in constant currency, as foreign currency exchange rates negatively impacted net sales by 5.0%. Excluding the 0.5% impact of acquisitions, net sales increased in constant currency by 8.6% from increased unit volume partially offset by 2.4% lower prices. The unit volume increase was led primarily by higher shipments of trauma and extremities products.MedSurg Net SalesMedSurg net sales in 2016 increased 25.6% as reported and 26.3% in constant currency, as foreign currency exchange rates negatively impacted net sales by 0.7%. Excluding the 19.1% impact of acquisitions, net sales increased in constant currency by 7.8% from increased unit volume partially offset by 0.6% lower prices. The unit volume increase was led primarily by higher shipments of instruments, endoscopy and medical products. MedSurg net sales in 2015 increased 3.0% as reported and 6.2% in constant currency, as foreign currency exchange rates negatively impacted net sales by 3.2%. Excluding the 1.7% impact of acquisitions, net sales increased in constant currency by 4.8% from increased unit volume partially offset by 0.3% lower prices. The unit volume increase was led primarily by higher shipments of our medical and instrument products.Neurotechnology and Spine Net SalesNeurotechnology and Spine net sales in 2016 increased 9.9% as reported and 9.8% in constant currency, as foreign currency exchange rates positively impacted net sales by 0.1%. Excluding the 1.4% impact of acquisitions, net sales in constant currency increased by 9.8% from increased unit volume partially offset by 1.4% lower prices. The unit volume increase was led primarily by higher shipments of neurotechnology products. Neurotechnology and Spine net sales in 2015 increased 5.0% as reported and 9.5% in constant currency as foreign currency exchange negatively impacted net sales by 4.5%. Excluding the 0.1% impact of acquisitions, net sales increased in constant currency by 11.6% from increased unit volume and changes in product mix partially offset by 2.3% lower prices. The unit volume increase was led primarily by higher shipments of neurotechnology products.Gross ProfitGross profit in 2016 as a percentage of net sales decreased to 66.2% from 66.4% in 2015 as the benefit from the suspension of the medical device excise tax and favorable productivity was more than offset by unfavorable mix, including the impact of acquisitions and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased to 66.4% in 2015 from 65.7% in 2014, primarily due to product mix and the favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates offset by decreases in the selling prices of our products.

Recent acquisitions, and spending on projects and investments in new technologies contributed to the spending levels reflecting our continued investment in internal innovation. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales in 2016 increased to 36.5% from 36.3% in 2015. Excluding the impact of certain items in the table below, expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased to 34.8% in 2016 from 35.3% in 2015. This improvement reflects favorable leverage from the continued focus on operating expense improvement initiatives, cost containment efforts and business mix, including leverage from our recent acquisitions. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales in 2015 decreased to 36.3% from 36.7% in 2014. Excluding the impact of certain items noted below, selling, general and administrative expenses increased in 2015 due to increased expenses related to our European regional headquarters, higher compensation costs, due in part to sales performance-related commissions, partially offset by disciplined expense management.

Refer to Note 6 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.Amortization of Intangible AssetsAmortization of intangible assets was $319, $210 and $188 in 2016, 2015 and 2014. The increases were primarily due to acquisitions. Refer to Note 7 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.Other Income (Expense), NetOther income (expense), net was ($245), ($126) and ($86) in 2016, 2015 and 2014. The increase in 2016 was primarily driven by higher interest expense due to higher debt levels as a result of our March 2016 debt offering. Refer to Note 9 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.Income TaxesThe effective income tax rate on earnings was 14.3%, 17.1% and 55.6% for 2016, 2015 and 2014. The effective income tax rate for 2014 includes the tax impacts of the establishment of a European regional headquarters and the cash repatriation that affected 2014 but was executed in 2015. The establishment of the European regional headquarters contributed to the lower effective income tax rates in 2015 and 2016. We adopted ASU 2016-09 Compensation-Stock Compensation: Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting on January 1, 2017 which will impact our effective tax rate in 2017. Net EarningsNet earnings in 2016 increased to $1,647 or $4.35 per diluted share from $1,439 or $3.78 per diluted share in 2015 and $515 or $1.34 per diluted share in 2014. The impact of foreign currency exchange rates reduced net earnings per diluted share by approximately $0.11, $0.26 and $0.14 in 2016, 2015 and 2014.

We believe that these non-GAAP measures provide meaningful information to assist investors and shareholders in understanding our financial results and assessing our prospects for future performance. Management believes percentage sales growth in constant currency and the other adjusted measures described above are important indicators of our operations because they exclude items that may not be indicative of or are unrelated to our core operating results and provide a baseline for analyzing trends in our underlying businesses. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures for reviewing the operating results of reportable business segments and analyzing potential future business trends in connection with our budget process and bases certain management incentive compensation on these non-GAAP financial measures. To measure percentage sales growth in constant currency, we remove the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates that affect the comparability and trend of sales. Percentage sales growth in constant currency is calculated by translating current year results at prior year average foreign currency exchange rates. To measure percentage organic sales growth, we remove the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and acquisitions that affect the comparability and trend of sales. Percentage organic sales growth is calculated by translating current year results at prior year average foreign currency exchange rates excluding the impact of acquisitions.To measure earnings performance on a consistent and comparable basis, we exclude certain items that affect the comparability of operating results and the trend of earnings. These adjustments are irregular in timing, may not be indicative of our past and future performance and are therefore excluded to allow investors to better understand underlying operating trends. The following are Dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.11STRYKER CORPORATION 2016 Form 10-Kexamples of the types of adjustments that may be included in a period:1.Acquisition and integration related costs. Costs related to integrating recently acquired businesses and specific costs related to the consummation of the acquisition process.2.Amortization of purchased intangible assets. Periodic amortization expense related to purchased intangible assets. 3.Restructuring-related charges. Costs associated with workforce reductions and other restructuring-related activities.4.Rejuvenate and other recall matters. Our best estimate of the minimum of the range of probable loss to resolve certain product recalls.5.Regulatory and legal matters. Our best estimate of the minimum of the range of probable loss to resolve certain regulatory matters and other legal settlements. 6.Tax matters. Certain significant and discrete tax items and adjustments to interest expense related to the settlement of certain tax matters. Because non-GAAP financial measures are not standardized, it may not be possible to compare these financial measures with other companies' non-GAAP financial measures having the same or similar names. These adjusted financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for reported sales growth, gross profit, cost of sales, selling, general and administrative expenses, amortization of intangible assets, operating income, effective income tax rate, net earnings and net earnings per diluted share, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are an additional way of viewing aspects of our operations that, when viewed with our GAAP results and the reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures at the end of the discussion of Results of Operations below, provide a more complete understanding of our business. We strongly encourage investors and shareholders to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure.The weighted-average basic and diluted shares outstanding used in the calculation of non-GAAP earnings per share are the same as those used in the calculation of the reported per share amounts.Reconciliation of the Most Directly Comparable GAAP Financial Measure to Non-GAAP Financial Measures2016Gross ProfitSelling, General & Administrative ExpensesAmortization of Intangible AssetsOperating IncomeNet EarningsEffective Tax RateDiluted EPSReported$7,495$4,137$319$2,166$1,64714.3 %$4.35Acquisition and integration related charges: Inventory stepped up to fair value36——36230.40.06Other acquisition and integration related—(95)—95770.10.20Amortization of purchased intangible assets——(319)3192212.20.59Restructuring-related charges15(110)—125980.30.26Rejuvenate and other recall matters———1581270.10.34Legal matters—12—(12)(7)(0.2)(0.02)Tax Matters————80.10.02Adjusted$7,546$3,944$—$2,887$2,19417.3 %$5.802015Gross ProfitSelling, General & Administrative ExpensesAmortization of Intangible AssetsOperating IncomeNet EarningsEffective Tax RateDiluted EPSReported$6,602$3,610$210$1,861$1,43917.1 %$3.78Acquisition and integration related charges: Inventory stepped up to fair value7——740.10.01Other acquisition and integration related—(28)—28200.20.05Amortization of purchased intangible assets——(210)2101471.50.39Restructuring-related charges7(125)—132970.70.26Rejuvenate and other recall matters———2962102.00.55Legal matters—53—(53)(46)0.1(0.12)Tax Matters————78(4.4)0.20Adjusted$6,616$3,510$—$2,481$1,94917.3 %$5.122014Gross ProfitSelling, General & Administrative ExpensesAmortization of Intangible AssetsOperating IncomeNet EarningsEffective Tax RateDiluted EPSReported$6,356$3,547$188$1,246$51555.6 %$1.34Acquisition and integration related charges: Inventory stepped up to fair value27——27150.50.04Other acquisition and integration related—(75)—75500.70.13Amortization of purchased intangible assets——(188)1881331.10.35Restructuring-related charges1(116)—117781.10.20Rejuvenate and other recall matters———761628(3.1)1.65Tax Matters————391(33.6)1.02Adjusted$6,384$3,356$—$2,414$1,81022.3 %$4.73Dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.12STRYKER CORPORATION 2016 Form 10-KFINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY 201620152014Net cash provided by operations activities$1,812$899$1,782Net cash (used in) provided by investing activities(4,191)1,956(1,878)Net cash provided (used in) financing activities2,361(1,141)629Effect of exchange rate changes(45)(130)(77)Change in cash and cash equivalents$(63)$1,584$456We believe our financial condition continues to be of high quality, as evidenced by our ability to generate substantial cash from operations and ready access to capital markets at competitive rates.Operating cash flow provides the primary source of cash to fund operating needs and capital expenditures. Excess operating cash is used first to fund acquisitions to complement our portfolio of businesses. Other discretionary uses include dividends and share repurchases. As necessary, we supplement operating cash flow with debt to fund our activities. Our overall cash position reflects our strong business results and a global cash management strategy that takes into account liquidity management, economic factors and tax considerations.Operating ActivitiesCash provided by operations was $1,812, $899, and $1,782 in 2016, 2015 and 2014. The increase in cash from operations in 2016 was primarily due to lower Rejuvenate and ABG II recall-related payments compared to 2015, which was partially offset by higher levels of inventory in 2016. The net of accounts receivable, inventory and accounts payable resulted in the consumption of $507, $231, and $249 of cash in 2016, 2015 and 2014. Investing ActivitiesCash (used in) provided by investing activities was ($4,191), $1,956 and ($1,878) in 2016, 2015 and in 2014. Acquisitions: Acquisitions resulted in cash consumption of $4,332, $153 and $916 in 2016, 2015 and 2014. In 2016 we acquired Sage, Physio, Synergetics and certain other businesses and related assets. In 2015 the primary acquisition was CHG. In 2014 the primary acquisitions were Patient Safety Technologies, Inc., Pivot Medical Inc., Berchtold Holding, AG and Small Bone Innovations, Inc.Purchases of Property, Plant and Equipment: Purchases of property, plant and equipment were $490, $270 and $233 in 2016, 2015 and 2014. Capital expenditures in 2016 were primarily due to capital expenditures associated with our global ERP system and the construction of a dedicated additive manufacturing facility.Marketable Securities, Net: Net cash provided by (used in) the sale of marketable securities was $634, $2,379, and ($729) in 2016, 2015 and 2014. Cash provided by the sale of marketable securities in 2016 was used to repay all of our senior unsecured notes that were due in September 2016. Cash provided by sales of marketable securities in 2015 was primarily due to the sale of a portion of our marketable securities in 2015 used to make recall-related payments. Financing ActivitiesDividends and Share Repurchases: Dividends paid per common share increased 10.1% to $1.52 per share in 2016 compared to $1.38 per share in 2015, an increase of 13.1% from $1.22 in 2014. 201620152014Dividends paid per common share$1.52$1.38$1.22Total dividends paid to common shareholders$568$521$462Total amount paid to repurchase common stock $13$700$100Shares of repurchased common stock (in millions) 0.17.41.3 Borrowings and Repayments of Debt: We maintain debt levels that we consider appropriate after evaluating a number of factors, including cash flow expectations, cash requirements for ongoing operations, investment and financing plans (including acquisitions and share repurchase activities) and overall cost of capital.Net proceeds from borrowings were $2,912, $48 and $1,159 in 2016, 2015 and 2014. In 2016 the proceeds were primarily from the issuance of $3,500 of senior unsecured notes in March 2016 partially offset by repayment of $750 of our senior unsecured notes due in September 2016. In 2015 the proceeds were primarily from the public offerings of notes offset by the payment of certain notes due and paid in January 2015. Refer to Note 9 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.LiquidityCash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $3,384 and $4,079, and our current assets exceeded current liabilities by $4,713 and $4,441 on December 31, 2016 and 2015. We anticipate being able to support our short-term liquidity and operating needs, including acquisitions and recall-related payments, from a variety of sources, including cash from operations, commercial paper and existing credit lines. We have raised funds in the capital markets and may continue to do so from time to time. As a result of the issuance of senior unsecured notes in March 2016, Moody's downgraded our unsecured note ratings to Baa1 from A3, and Standard & Poor's downgraded our corporate credit and long-term issue-level rating to A from A+ and our short-term rating to A-1 from A-1+. Nevertheless, we continue to have strong investment-grade short-term and long-term debt ratings that we believe should enable us to refinance our debt as needed.We have existing credit facilities should additional funds be required. In August 2016 we increased the borrowing capacity available under our main credit facility by $250 to a maximum of $1,500. In September 2016 we increased the amount of commercial paper issuable under the commercial paper program by $250 to a maximum of $1,500.On December 31, 2016 approximately 84% of our consolidated cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were held in locations outside the United States compared to 46% on December 31, 2015. The majority of our cash held in locations outside the United States is considered to be indefinitely reinvested. We intend to use this cash to expand operations organically and through acquisitions.In January 2017 we sold $500 of senior unsecured notes with an interest rate of 1.800% due on January 15, 2019. Guarantees and Other Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsWe do not have guarantees or other off-balance sheet financing arrangements, including variable interest entities, of a magnitude that we believe could have a material impact on our financial condition or liquidity.CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND FORWARD-LOOKING CASH REQUIREMENTSAs further described in Note 6 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, in 2016 we recorded additional charges to earnings totaling $144 related to the Rejuvenate and ABG II recalls. Based on the information received, the actuarially determined range of probable loss to resolve this matter was estimated to be approximately $1,968 to $2,224 ($2,200 to $2,456 before $232 of third-party insurance recoveries). The final outcome of this matter is dependent on many variables that are difficult to predict. The ultimate cost to entirely resolve this matter may be materially different than the amount of the current estimate and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of Dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.13STRYKER CORPORATION 2016 Form 10-Koperations and cash flows. We are not able to reasonably estimate the future periods in which payments will be made.As further described in Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, on December 31, 2016 we had a reserve for uncertain income tax positions of $287. Due to uncertainties regarding the ultimate resolution of income tax audits, we are not able to reasonably estimate the future periods in which any income tax payments to settle these uncertain income tax positions will be made.As further described in Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, on December 31, 2016 our defined benefit pension plans were underfunded by $280, of which approximately $271 related to plans outside the United States. Due to the rules affecting tax-deductible contributions in the jurisdictions in which the plans are offered and the impact of future plan asset performance, changes in interest rates and potential changes in legislation in the United States and other foreign jurisdictions, we are not able to reasonably estimate beyond 2017 the amounts that may be required to fund defined benefit pension plans.

These include inventory reserves, income taxes, acquisitions, goodwill and intangible assets, and legal and other contingencies. We believe these accounting policies and the others set forth in Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements should be reviewed as they are integral to understanding our results of operations and financial condition. Inventory ReservesWe maintain reserves for excess and obsolete inventory resulting from the potential inability to sell certain products at prices in excess of current carrying costs. We make estimates regarding the future recoverability of the costs of these products and record provisions based on historical experience, expiration of sterilization dates and expected future trends. If actual product life cycles, product demand or acceptance of new product introductions are less favorable than projected by management, additional inventory write downs may be required, which could unfavorably affect future operating results.Income TaxesOur annual tax rate is determined based on our income, statutory tax rates and the tax impacts of items treated differently for tax purposes than for financial reporting purposes. Tax law requires certain items be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return, and some differences are temporary and reverse over time, such as depreciation expense. These temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent the tax effect of items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in our income statement. Deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in our financial statements for which payment was deferred, the tax effect of expenditures for which a deduction was taken in our tax return but has not yet been recognized in our financial statements or assets recorded at fair value in business combinations for which there was no corresponding tax basis adjustment.Inherent in determining our annual tax rate are judgments regarding business plans, tax planning opportunities and expectations about future outcomes. Realization of certain deferred tax assets is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction prior to the expiration of the carryforward periods. Although realization is not assured, management believes it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances, will be realized.We operate in multiple jurisdictions with complex tax policy and regulatory environments. In certain of these jurisdictions, we may take tax positions that management believes are supportable but are potentially subject to successful challenge by the applicable taxing authority. These differences of interpretation with the respective governmental taxing authorities can be impacted by the local economic and fiscal environment. We evaluate our tax positions and establish liabilities in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance on uncertainty in income taxes. We review these tax uncertainties in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of tax audits, and adjust them accordingly. We have a number of audits in process in various jurisdictions. Although the resolution of these tax positions is uncertain, based on currently available information, we believe that it is more likely than not that the ultimate outcomes will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.Due to the number of estimates and assumptions inherent in calculating the various components of our tax provision, certain changes or future events, such as changes in tax legislation, geographic mix of earnings, completion of tax audits or earnings repatriation plans, could have an impact on those estimates and our effective tax rate.Acquisitions, Goodwill and Intangibles, and Long-Lived AssetsOur financial statements include the operations of an acquired business starting from the completion of the acquisition. In addition, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded on the date of acquisition at their respective estimated fair values, with any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired recorded as goodwill. Significant judgment is required in estimating the fair value of intangible assets and in assigning their respective useful lives. Accordingly, we typically obtain the assistance of third-party valuation specialists for significant items. The fair value estimates are based on available historical information and on future expectations and assumptions deemed reasonable by management but are inherently uncertain. We typically use an income method to estimate the fair value of intangible assets, which is based on forecasts of the expected future cash flows attributable to the respective assets. Significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the valuations reflect a consideration of other marketplace participants and include the amount and timing of future cash flows (including expected growth rates and profitability), the underlying product or technology life cycles, the economic barriers to entry and the discount rate applied to the cash flows. Unanticipated market or macroeconomic events and circumstances Dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.14STRYKER CORPORATION 2016 Form 10-Kmay occur that could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and assumptions. Determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment. With the exception of certain trade names, the majority of our acquired intangible assets (e.g., certain trademarks or brands, customer and distributor relationships, patents and technologies) are expected to have determinable useful lives. Our assessment as to the useful lives of these intangible assets is based on a number of factors including competitive environment, market share, trademark, brand history, underlying product life cycles, operating plans and the macroeconomic environment of the countries in which the trademarked or branded products are sold. Our estimates of the useful lives of determinable-lived intangibles are primarily based on these same factors. Determinable-lived intangible assets are amortized to expense over their estimated useful life. In certain of our acquisitions, we acquire in-process research and development (IPRD) intangible assets. IPRD is considered to be an indefinite-lived intangible asset until such time as the research is completed (at which time it becomes a determinable-lived intangible asset) or determined to have no future use (at which time it is impaired).The value of indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill is not amortized but is tested at least annually for impairment. Our impairment testing for goodwill is performed separately from our impairment testing of indefinite-lived intangibles. We perform our annual impairment test for goodwill in the fourth quarter of each year. We consider qualitative indicators of the fair value of a reporting unit when it is unlikely that a reporting unit has impaired goodwill. In certain circumstances, we may also utilize a discounted cash flow analysis that requires certain assumptions and estimates be made regarding market conditions and our future profitability. In those circumstances we test goodwill for impairment by reviewing the book value compared to the fair value at the reporting unit level. We test individual indefinite-lived intangibles by reviewing the individual book values compared to the fair value. We determine the fair value of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets based on the income approach. Under the income approach, we calculate the fair value of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. Considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating and macroeconomic changes and to estimate future cash flows to measure fair value. Assumptions used in our impairment evaluations, such as forecasted growth rates and cost of capital, are consistent with internal projections and operating plans. We believe such assumptions and estimates are also comparable to those that would be used by other marketplace participants. We did not recognize any impairment charges for goodwill in the years presented, as our annual impairment testing indicated that all reporting unit goodwill fair values exceeded their respective recorded values. Future changes in the judgments, assumptions and estimates that are used in our impairment testing for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, including discount and tax rates and future cash flow projections, could result in significantly different estimates of the fair values. A significant reduction in the estimated fair values could result in impairment charges that could materially affect our results of operations.We review our other long-lived assets for indicators of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The evaluation is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, which is at the individual asset level or the asset group level. The undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the related assets are estimated over their useful life based on updated projections. If the evaluation indicates that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable, any potential impairment is measured based upon the fair value of the related assets or asset group as determined by an appropriate market appraisal or other valuation technique. Assets classified as held for sale, if any, are recorded at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell. Legal and Other ContingenciesWe are involved in various ongoing proceedings, legal actions and claims arising in the normal course of business, including proceedings related to product, labor and intellectual property, and other matters that are more fully described in Note 6 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. The outcomes of these matters will generally not be known for prolonged periods of time. In certain of the legal proceedings, the claimants seek damages, as well as other compensatory and equitable relief, that could result in the payment of significant claims and settlements and/or the imposition of injunctions or other equitable relief. For legal matters for which management had sufficient information to reasonably estimate our future obligations, a liability representing management's best estimate of the probable loss, or the minimum of the range of probable losses when a best estimate within the range is not known, for the resolution of these legal matters is recorded. The estimates are based on consultation with legal counsel, previous settlement experience and settlement strategies. If actual outcomes are less favorable than those projected by management, additional expense may be incurred, which could unfavorably affect future operating results. We are currently self-insured for product liability-related claims and expenses. The ultimate cost to us with respect to product liability claims could be materially different than the amount of the current estimates and accruals and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTSRefer to Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.ITEM 7A.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.We sell our products globally and, as a result, our financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as weak economic conditions or changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Our operating results are primarily exposed to changes in exchange rates among the United States Dollar, European currencies, in particular the Euro, Swiss Franc and the British Pound, the Japanese Yen, the Australian Dollar and the Canadian Dollar. We develop and manufacture products in the United States, Canada, Turkey, China, France, Germany, Ireland, Mexico, Puerto Rico and Switzerland and incur costs in the applicable local currencies. This global deployment of facilities serves to partially mitigate the impact of currency exchange rate changes on our cost of sales. Refer to Notes 1, 3 and 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding our use of derivative instruments to mitigate these risks. A hypothetical 10% change in foreign currencies relative to the United States Dollar would change the December 31, 2016 fair value by approximately $188.

Excluding the impact of acquisitions, net sales grew 7.1% in constant currency, in line with our ongoing goal to grow organic sales at the high-end of MedTech. We reported net earnings of $1,020 and net earnings per diluted share of $2.68. Excluding the impact of certain items, we achieved adjusted net earnings of $2,465 and growth of 11.9% in adjusted net earnings per diluted share(1). We continued our capital allocation strategy by investing $831 in acquisitions, paying $636 in dividends to our shareholders and using $230 for share repurchases.In December 2017 we announced a definitive merger agreement to acquire Entellus Medical, Inc. (Entellus), a high-growth global medical technology company focused on delivering superior patient and physician experiences through products designed for the minimally invasive treatment of various ear, nose and throat (ENT) disease states, for $24.00 per share, or total consideration of approximately $662. We expect the acquisition to close in February 2018. In September 2017 we acquired NOVADAQ Technologies Inc. (NOVADAQ) for total consideration of approximately $716. NOVADAQ is a leading developer of fluorescence imaging technology that provides surgeons with visualization of blood flow in vessels and related tissue perfusion in cardiac, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, plastic, microsurgical and reconstructive procedures. Refer to Note 5 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.In August 2017 we initiated a voluntary product recall involving specific lots of our Sage Products (Sage) Oral Care products. We took this action in response to a Warning Letter received from the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) dated July 17, 2017, which set forth concerns regarding the potential for cross-contamination of Oral Care solutions manufactured by a third-party supplier on equipment also used to manufacture non-pharmaceutical products. We discontinued business with the third-party supplier and the Oral Care solutions are now being manufactured in-house. We resumed shipping Oral Care products in October and returned to full supply capacity by the end of 2017.We also placed Sage cloth-based products on a temporary ship hold during the third quarter in response to concerns set forth in the FDA Warning Letter regarding testing methods used for all Sage products containing solutions. We resumed shipping products manufactured in-house and tested under the testing method required by FDA in September 2017 and returned to full supply capacity by the end of 2017. In January 2017 we issued $500 of senior unsecured notes. Refer to Note 9 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

We believe that these non-GAAP measures provide meaningful information to assist investors and shareholders in understanding our financial results and assessing our prospects for future performance. Management believes percentage sales growth in constant currency and the other adjusted measures described above are important indicators of our operations because they exclude items that may not be indicative of or are unrelated to our core operating results and provide a baseline for analyzing trends in our underlying businesses. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures for reviewing the operating results of reportable business segments and analyzing potential future business trends in connection with our budget process and bases certain management incentive compensation on these non-GAAP financial measures. To measure percentage sales growth in constant currency, we remove the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates that affect the comparability and trend of sales.

Percentage organic sales growth is calculated by translating current year results at prior year average foreign currency exchange rates excluding the impact of acquisitions.To measure earnings performance on a consistent and comparable basis, we exclude certain items that affect the comparability of operating results and the trend of earnings. These adjustments are irregular in timing and may not be indicative of our past and future performance. The following are examples of the types of adjustments that may be included in a period:1.Acquisition and integration-related costs. Costs related to integrating recently acquired businesses and specific costs (e.g., inventory step-up and deal costs) related to the consummation of the acquisition process.2.Amortization of purchased intangible assets. Periodic amortization expense related to purchased intangible assets. 3.Restructuring-related and other charges. Costs associated with the termination of sales relationships in certain countries, workforce reductions, elimination of product lines, weather-related asset impairments and associated costs and other restructuring-related activities.4.Rejuvenate and other recall matters. Our best estimate of the minimum of the range of probable loss to resolve certain product recalls.5.Regulatory and legal matters. Our best estimate of the minimum of the range of probable loss to resolve certain regulatory matters and other legal settlements. 6.Tax matters. Charges represent the impact of accounting for the compliance with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, certain significant and discrete tax items and adjustments to interest expense related to the settlement of certain tax matters. Because non-GAAP financial measures are not standardized, it may not be possible to compare these financial measures with other companies' non-GAAP financial measures having the same or similar names. These adjusted financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for reported sales growth, gross profit, cost of sales, selling, general and administrative expenses, amortization of intangible assets, operating income, effective income tax rate, net earnings and net earnings per diluted share, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are an additional way of viewing aspects of our operations when viewed with our GAAP results and the reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures at the end of the discussion of Results of Operations below. We strongly encourage investors and shareholders to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure.The weighted-average basic and diluted shares outstanding used in the calculation of non-GAAP earnings per share are the same as those used in the calculation of the reported per share amounts.

Operating cash flow provides the primary source of cash to fund operating needs and capital expenditures. Excess operating cash is used first to fund acquisitions to complement our portfolio of businesses. Other discretionary uses include dividends and share repurchases. We supplement operating cash flow with debt to fund our activities as necessary. Our overall cash position reflects our strong business results and a global cash management strategy that takes into account liquidity management, economic factors and tax considerations.Operating ActivitiesCash provided by operations was $1,559, $1,915, and $981 in 2017, 2016 and 2015. The decrease in cash from operations in 2017 was primarily due to higher Rejuvenate and ABG II recall-related payments compared to 2016 and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency remeasurement. The net of accounts receivable, inventory and accounts payable resulted in the consumption of $461, $507, and $231 of cash in 2017, 2016 and 2015. Investing ActivitiesCash (used in) provided by investing activities was ($1,613), ($4,191) and $1,956 in 2017, 2016 and in 2015. Acquisitions, Net of Cash Acquired: Acquisitions resulted in cash consumption of $831, $4,332 and $153 in 2017, 2016 and 2015. In 2017 we acquired NOVADAQ and certain other businesses and related assets. In 2016 the primary acquisitions were Sage and Physio. In 2015 the primary acquisition was CHG Hospital Beds, Inc.Purchases of Property, Plant and Equipment: Purchases of property, plant and equipment were $598, $490 and $270 in 2017, 2016 and 2015. Capital expenditures in 2017 were primarily due to capital expenditures associated with the development of our global ERP system and investments in new and existing plants and equipment to support sales growth. Marketable Securities, Net: Net cash (used in) provided by the (purchase) sale of marketable securities was ($183), $634, and $2,379 in 2017, 2016 and 2015. Cash provided by the sale of marketable securities in 2016 was used to repay all of our senior unsecured notes that were due in September 2016. Cash provided by sales of marketable securities in 2015 was primarily used to make recall-related payments. Financing ActivitiesDividends and Share Repurchases: Dividends paid per common share increased 11.8% to $1.70 per share in 2017 compared to $1.52 per share in 2016, an increase of 10.1% from $1.38 in 2015. 201720162015Dividends paid per common share$1.70$1.52$1.38Total dividends paid to common shareholders$636$568$521Total amount paid to repurchase common stock $230$13$700Shares of repurchased common stock (in millions) 1.90.17.4Borrowings and Repayments of Debt: We maintain debt levels that we consider appropriate after evaluating a number of factors including cash requirements for ongoing operations, investment and financing plans (including acquisitions and share repurchase activities) and overall cost of capital.Net proceeds from borrowings were $299, $2,912 and $48 in 2017, 2016 and 2015. In 2017 the proceeds were primarily from the issuance of $500 of senior unsecured notes in January 2017 partially offset by payment of $200 of commercial paper. In 2016 the proceeds were primarily from the issuance of $3,500 of senior unsecured notes in March 2016 partially offset by repayment of $750 of our senior unsecured notes due in September 2016. Refer to Note 9 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.LiquidityCash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $2,793 and $3,384, and our current assets exceeded current liabilities by $4,508 and $4,713 on December 31, 2017 and 2016. We anticipate being able to support our short-term liquidity and operating needs, including acquisitions and recall-related payments, from a variety of sources, including cash from operations, commercial paper and existing credit lines. We have raised funds in the capital markets and may continue to do so from time to time. As a result of the issuance of senior unsecured notes in March 2016, Moody's downgraded our unsecured note ratings to Baa1 from A3, and Standard & Poor's downgraded our corporate credit and long-term issue-level rating to A from A+ and our short-term rating to A-1 from A-1+. Nevertheless, we continue to have strong investment-grade short-term and long-term debt ratings that we believe should enable us to refinance our debt as needed.We have existing credit facilities should additional funds be required. We have a borrowing capacity available under our main credit facility of $1,500. The amount of commercial paper we have issuable under the commercial paper program is $1,500.Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held in locations outside the United States was approximately 62% and 84% on December 31, 2017 and 2016. The majority of our cash held in locations outside the United States is considered to be indefinitely reinvested. We intend to use this cash to expand operations organically and through acquisitions.Dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.12STRYKER CORPORATION 2017 FORM 10-KGuarantees and Other Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsWe do not have guarantees or other off-balance sheet financing arrangements, including variable interest entities, of a magnitude that we believe could have a material impact on our financial condition or liquidity.CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND FORWARD-LOOKING CASH REQUIREMENTSAs further described in Note 6 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, in 2017 we recorded additional charges to earnings totaling $104 related to the Rejuvenate and ABG II recalls. Based on the information received, the actuarially determined range of probable loss to resolve this matter was estimated to be approximately $2,072 to $2,307 ($2,304 to $2,539 before $232 of third-party insurance recoveries). The final outcome of this matter is dependent on many variables that are difficult to predict. The ultimate cost to entirely resolve this matter may be materially different than the amount of the current estimate and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. We are not able to reasonably estimate the future periods in which payments will be made.As further described in Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, on December 31, 2017 we had a reserve for uncertain income tax positions of $540. Due to uncertainties regarding the ultimate resolution of income tax audits, we are not able to reasonably estimate the future periods in which any income tax payments to settle these uncertain income tax positions will be made.As further described in Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, on December 31, 2017 our defined benefit pension plans were underfunded by $338, of which approximately $331 related to plans outside the United States. Due to the rules affecting tax-deductible contributions in the jurisdictions in which the plans are offered and the impact of future plan asset performance, changes in interest rates and potential changes in legislation in the United States and other foreign jurisdictions, we are not able to reasonably estimate the amounts that may be required to fund defined benefit pension plans.

We believe these accounting policies and the others set forth in Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements are critical to understanding our results of operations and financial condition. Actual results could differ from our estimates and assumptions, and any such differences could be material to our results of operations and financial condition. Inventory ReservesWe maintain reserves for excess and obsolete inventory resulting from the potential inability to sell certain products at prices in excess of current carrying costs. We make estimates regarding the future recoverability of the costs of these products and record provisions based on historical experience, expiration of sterilization dates and expected future trends. If actual product life cycles, product demand or acceptance of new product introductions are less favorable than projected by management, additional inventory write downs may be required, which could unfavorably affect future operating results.Income TaxesOur annual tax rate is determined based on our income, statutory tax rates and the tax impacts of items treated differently for tax purposes than for financial reporting purposes. Tax law requires certain items be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return, and some differences are temporary and reverse over time, such as depreciation expense. These temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities.Deferred tax assets generally represent the tax effect of items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in our income statement. Deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in our financial statements for which payment was deferred, the tax effect of expenditures for which a deduction was taken in our tax return but has not yet been recognized in our financial statements or assets recorded at fair value in business combinations for which there was no corresponding tax basis adjustment.Inherent in determining our annual tax rate are judgments regarding business plans, tax planning opportunities and expectations about future outcomes. Realization of certain deferred tax assets is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction prior to the expiration of the carryforward periods. Although realization is not assured, management believes it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances, will be realized.We operate in multiple jurisdictions with complex tax policy and regulatory environments. In certain of these jurisdictions, we may take tax positions that management believes are supportable but are potentially subject to successful challenge by the applicable taxing authority. These differences of interpretation with the respective governmental taxing authorities can be impacted by the local economic and fiscal environment. We evaluate our tax positions and establish liabilities in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance on uncertainty in income taxes. We review these tax uncertainties in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of tax audits, and adjust them accordingly. We have a number of audits in process in various jurisdictions. Although the resolution of these tax positions is uncertain, based on currently available information, we believe that it is more likely than not that the ultimate outcomes will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.Due to the number of estimates and assumptions inherent in calculating the various components of our tax provision, certain changes or future events, such as changes in tax legislation, geographic mix of earnings, completion of tax audits or earnings repatriation plans, could have an impact on those estimates and our effective tax rate.Dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.13STRYKER CORPORATION 2017 FORM 10-KAcquisitions, Goodwill and Intangibles, and Long-Lived AssetsOur financial statements include the operations of an acquired business starting from the completion of the acquisition. In addition, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded on the date of acquisition at their respective estimated fair values, with any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired recorded as goodwill. Significant judgment is required in estimating the fair value of intangible assets and in assigning their respective useful lives. Accordingly, we typically obtain the assistance of third-party valuation specialists for significant items. The fair value estimates are based on available historical information and on future expectations and assumptions deemed reasonable by management but are inherently uncertain. We typically use an income method to estimate the fair value of intangible assets, which is based on forecasts of the expected future cash flows attributable to the respective assets. Significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the valuations reflect a consideration of other marketplace participants and include the amount and timing of future cash flows (including expected growth rates and profitability), the underlying product or technology life cycles, the economic barriers to entry and the discount rate applied to the cash flows. Unanticipated market or macroeconomic events and circumstances may occur that could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and assumptions. Determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment. With the exception of certain trade names, the majority of our acquired intangible assets (e.g., certain trademarks or brands, customer and distributor relationships, patents and technologies) are expected to have determinable useful lives. Our assessment as to the useful lives of these intangible assets is based on a number of factors including competitive environment, market share, trademark, brand history, underlying product life cycles, operating plans and the macroeconomic environment of the countries in which the trademarked or branded products are sold. Our estimates of the useful lives of determinable-lived intangibles are primarily based on these same factors. Determinable-lived intangible assets are amortized to expense over their estimated useful life. In some of our acquisitions, we acquire in-process research and development (IPRD) intangible assets. IPRD is considered to be an indefinite-lived intangible asset until the research is completed (then it becomes a determinable-lived intangible asset) or determined to have no future use (then it is impaired).The value of indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill is not amortized but is tested at least annually for impairment. Our impairment testing for goodwill is performed separately from our impairment testing of indefinite-lived intangibles. We perform our annual impairment test for goodwill in the fourth quarter of each year. We consider qualitative indicators of the fair value of a reporting unit when it is unlikely that a reporting unit has impaired goodwill. In certain circumstances, we also use a discounted cash flow analysis that requires certain assumptions and estimates be made regarding market conditions and our future profitability. In those circumstances we test goodwill for impairment by reviewing the book value compared to the fair value at the reporting unit level. We test individual indefinite-lived intangibles by reviewing the individual book values compared to the fair value. We determine the fair value of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets based on the income approach. Under the income approach, we calculate the fair value of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. Considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating and macroeconomic changes and to estimate future cash flows to measure fair value. Assumptions used in our impairment evaluations, such as forecasted growth rates and cost of capital, are consistent with internal projections and operating plans. We believe such assumptions and estimates are also comparable to those that would be used by other marketplace participants. We did not recognize any impairment charges for goodwill in the years presented, as our annual impairment testing indicated that all reporting unit goodwill fair values exceeded their respective recorded values. Future changes in the judgments, assumptions and estimates that are used in our impairment testing for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, including discount and tax rates and future cash flow projections, could result in significantly different estimates of the fair values. A significant reduction in the estimated fair values could result in impairment charges that could materially affect our results of operations.We review our other long-lived assets for indicators of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The evaluation is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, which is at the individual asset level or the asset group level. The undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the related assets are estimated over their useful life based on updated projections. If the evaluation indicates that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable, any potential impairment is measured based upon the fair value of the related assets or asset group as determined by an appropriate market appraisal or other valuation technique. Assets classified as held for sale, if any, are recorded at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell. Legal and Other ContingenciesWe are involved in various ongoing proceedings, legal actions and claims arising in the normal course of business, including proceedings related to product, labor and intellectual property, and other matters that are more fully described in Note 6 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. The outcomes of these matters will generally not be known for prolonged periods of time. In certain of the legal proceedings, the claimants seek damages, as well as other compensatory and equitable relief, that could result in the payment of significant claims and settlements and/or the imposition of injunctions or other equitable relief. For legal matters for which management had sufficient information to reasonably estimate our future obligations, a liability representing management's best estimate of the probable loss, or the minimum of the range of probable losses when a best estimate within the range is not known, for the resolution of these legal matters is recorded. The estimates are based on consultation with legal counsel, previous settlement experience and settlement strategies. If actual outcomes are less favorable than those projected by management, additional expense may be incurred, which could unfavorably affect future operating results. We are currently self-insured for product liability-related claims and expenses. The ultimate cost to us with respect to product liability claims could be materially different than the amount of the current estimates and accruals and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTSRefer to Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.Dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.14ITEM 7A.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.We sell our products globally and, as a result, our financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as weak economic conditions or changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Our operating results are primarily exposed to changes in exchange rates among the United States Dollar, European currencies, in particular the Euro, Swiss Franc and the British Pound, the Japanese Yen, the Australian Dollar and the Canadian Dollar. We develop and manufacture products in the United States, Canada, China, France, Germany, Ireland, Japan, Mexico, Puerto Rico, Sweden, Switzerland and Turkey and incur costs in the applicable local currencies. This global deployment of facilities serves to partially mitigate the impact of currency exchange rate changes on our cost of sales. Refer to Notes 1, 3 and 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding our use of derivative instruments to mitigate these risks. A hypothetical 10% change in foreign currencies relative to the United States Dollar would change the December 31, 2017 fair value by approximately $349.

310764,SYK,STRYKER CORP,2019,"ITEM 7.MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.Overview of 2018Our goal is to achieve sales growth at the high-end of the medical technology (MedTech) industry and maintain our capital allocation strategy that prioritizes: (1) Acquisitions, (2) Dividends and (3) Share repurchases.In 2018 we achieved reported net sales growth of 9.3%. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and the adoption of Accounting Standards Update 2014-9, Revenue From Contracts with Customers, as well as related amendments, sales grew 7.9% in constant currency. We reported net earnings of $3,553 and net earnings per diluted share of $9.34. Excluding the impact of certain items, we achieved adjusted net earnings of $2,779 and growth of 12.6% in adjusted net earnings per diluted share(1). We continued our capital allocation strategy by investing $2,451 in acquisitions, paying $703 in dividends to our shareholders and using $300 for share repurchases.In November 2018 we completed the acquisition of K2M Group Holdings, Inc. (K2M) for $27.50 per share, or an aggregate purchase price of approximately $1,380. K2M is a global leader of complex spine and minimally invasive solutions focused on achieving three-dimensional Total Body Balance. K2M is part of our Spine business within Neurotechnology and Spine. In February 2018 we completed the acquisition of Entellus Medical, Inc. (Entellus) for $24.00 per share, or an aggregate purchase price of $697, net of cash acquired. Entellus is focused on delivering superior patient and physician experiences through products designed for the minimally invasive treatment of various ear, nose and throat (ENT) disease states. Entellus is part of our Neurotechnology business within Neurotechnology and Spine. In March 2018 we issued $600 of senior unsecured notes with a coupon of 3.650% due on March 7, 2028. In April 2018 we repaid $600 of our senior unsecured notes with a coupon of 1.300%. In November 2018 we issued: €300 of senior unsecured notes with a floating interest rate (Three Month EURIBOR plus 28 bps) due on November 30, 2020, €550 of senior unsecured notes with a fixed interest rate of 1.125% due on November 30, 2023, €750 of senior unsecured notes with a fixed interest rate of 2.125% due on November 30, 2027, and €650 of senior unsecured notes with a fixed interest rate of 2.625% due on November 30, 2030. Refer to Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.In December 2018 the transfer of certain intellectual properties between tax jurisdictions resulted in a $1.5 billion non-cash tax benefit and a corresponding $1.5 billion deferred tax asset. The benefit of the transaction will be realized as a reduction of cash paid for taxes over a period of nine years and a corresponding charge to tax expense, which consistent with the benefit recognized in 2018 will also be adjusted out of reported net earnings going forward in our non-GAAP financial measure.(1) Refer to ""Non-GAAP Financial Measures"" for a discussion of non-GAAP financial measures used in this report and a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.

The decrease in 2018 was primarily due to an increase in interest income due to higher interest rates partially offset by higher interest expense due to higher interest rates and higher debt outstanding. Refer to Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.Income TaxesOur effective tax rate was (50.8)%, 50.6% and 14.3% for 2018, 2017 and 2016. The effective income tax rate for 2018 reflects the tax effect related to the transfer of intellectual properties between tax jurisdictions, the continuing impact of complying with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the Tax Act), and continued lower effective income tax rates as a result of our European operations.The effective income tax rate for 2017 reflects compliance with the Tax Act offset by lower effective income tax rates as a result of our European operations. The effective income tax rate for 2016 reflects lower effective income tax rates as a result of our European operations.

We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful information to assist investors and shareholders in understanding our financial results and assessing our prospects for future performance. Management believes percentage sales growth in constant currency and the other adjusted measures described above are important indicators of our operations because they exclude items that may not be indicative of or are unrelated to our core operating results and provide a baseline for analyzing trends in our underlying businesses. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures for reviewing the operating results of reportable business segments and analyzing potential future business trends in connection with our budget process and bases certain management incentive compensation on these non-GAAP financial measures. To measure percentage sales growth in constant currency, we remove the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates that affect the comparability and trend of sales. Percentage sales growth in constant currency is calculated by translating current and prior year results at the same foreign currency exchange rate. To measure percentage organic sales growth, we remove the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, acquisitions and the impact of the adoption of ASC 606, which affect the comparability and trend of sales. Percentage organic sales growth is calculated by translating current year results at prior year average foreign currency exchange rates excluding the impact of acquisitions and the adoption of ASC 606. To measure earnings performance on a consistent and comparable basis, we exclude certain items that affect the comparability of operating results and the trend of earnings. These adjustments are irregular in timing and may not be indicative of our past and future performance. The following are examples of the types of adjustments that may be included in a period:1.Acquisition and integration-related costs. Costs related to integrating recently acquired businesses and specific costs Dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.11STRYKER CORPORATION 2018 FORM 10-K(e.g., inventory step-up and deal costs) related to the consummation of the acquisition process.2.Amortization of purchased intangible assets. Periodic amortization expense related to purchased intangible assets. 3.Restructuring-related and other charges. Costs associated with the termination of sales relationships in certain countries, workforce reductions, elimination of product lines, weather-related asset impairments and associated costs and other restructuring-related activities.4.Medical Device Regulations. Costs specific to updating our quality system, product labeling, asset write-offs and product remanufacturing to comply with the medical device reporting regulations and other requirements of the European Union and China regulations for medical devices.5.Recall-related matters. Our best estimate of the minimum of the range of probable loss to resolve the Rejuvenate, LFIT V40 and other product recalls.6.Regulatory and legal matters. Our best estimate of the minimum of the range of probable loss to resolve certain regulatory matters and other legal settlements. 7.Tax matters. Charges represent the impact of accounting for certain significant and discrete tax items, including adjustments related to the Tax Act. Because non-GAAP financial measures are not standardized, it may not be possible to compare these financial measures with other companies' non-GAAP financial measures having the same or similar names. These adjusted financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for reported sales growth, gross profit, selling, general and administrative expenses, amortization of intangible assets, operating income, effective income tax rate, net earnings and net earnings per diluted share, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are an additional way of viewing aspects of our operations when viewed with our GAAP results and the reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures at the end of the discussion of Consolidated Results of Operations below. We strongly encourage investors and shareholders to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure.The weighted-average diluted shares outstanding used in the calculation of non-GAAP net earnings per diluted share are the same as those used in the calculation of reported net earnings per diluted share for the respective period.

Operating cash flow provides the primary source of cash to fund operating needs and capital expenditures. Excess operating cash is used first to fund acquisitions to complement our portfolio of businesses. Other discretionary uses include dividends and share repurchases. We supplement operating cash flow with debt to fund our activities as necessary. Our overall cash position reflects our strong business results and a global cash management strategy that takes into account liquidity management, economic factors and tax considerations.Operating ActivitiesCash provided by operations was $2,610, $1,559, and $1,915 in 2018, 2017 and 2016. The increase was primarily due to lower recall-related payments, higher net earnings and cash receipts related to contracts with customers for unsatisfied performance obligations (partially due to the adoption of ASC 606) and cash receipts from an interest rate hedge settlement, partially offset by payments related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. The net of accounts receivable, inventory and accounts payable resulted in the consumption of $329, $461, and $507 of cash in 2018, 2017 and 2016. Investing ActivitiesCash used in investing activities was ($2,857), ($1,613) and ($4,191) in 2018, 2017 and 2016. The increase in cash used in 2018 was primarily due to increased payments for acquisitions, primarily the $697 acquisition of Entellus and $1,400 acquisition of K2M. In 2017 we acquired NOVADAQ and certain other businesses and related assets. In 2016 the primary acquisitions were Sage and Physio. Financing ActivitiesCash provided by (used in) financing activities was $1,329, ($794), and $2,258 in 2018, 2017 and 2016. The increase in cash provided was primarily due to higher net borrowings, primarily the issuance of €2,250 of senior unsecured notes, partially offset by $70 higher repurchases of our common stock and a $67 increase in dividends paid. We maintain debt levels that we consider appropriate after evaluating a number of factors including cash requirements for ongoing operations, investment and financing plans (including acquisitions and share repurchase activities) and overall cost of capital.

We anticipate being able to support our short-term liquidity and operating needs from a variety of sources, including cash from operations, commercial paper and existing credit lines. We raised funds in the capital markets in 2018 and may continue to do so from time to time. We continue to have strong investment-grade short-term and long-term debt ratings that we believe should enable us to refinance our debt as needed. We have existing credit facilities should additional funds be required. We have a borrowing capacity available under our main credit facility of $1,500. The amount of commercial paper we have issuable under the commercial paper program is $1,500.Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held in locations outside the United States was approximately 25% and 62% on December 31, 2018 and 2017. We intend to use this cash to expand operations organically and through acquisitions.Guarantees and Other Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsWe do not have guarantees or other off-balance sheet financing arrangements, including variable interest entities, of a magnitude that we believe could have a material impact on our financial condition or liquidity.CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND FORWARD-LOOKING CASH REQUIREMENTSAs further described in Note 7 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, in 2018 we recorded charges to earnings related to the Rejuvenate and ABG II and LFIT Anatomic CoCr V40 Femoral Heads recall matters. Recorded charges represent the minimum of the range of probable cost to resolve these matters. The final outcome of these matters is dependent on many variables that are difficult to predict. The ultimate cost to entirely resolve these matters may be materially different than the amount of the current estimates and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. We are not able to reasonably estimate the future periods in which payments will be made.As further described in Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, on December 31, 2018 we had a reserve for uncertain Dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.13STRYKER CORPORATION 2018 FORM 10-Kincome tax positions of $528. Due to uncertainties regarding the ultimate resolution of income tax audits, we are not able to reasonably estimate the future periods in which any income tax payments to settle these uncertain income tax positions will be made.As further described in Note 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, on December 31, 2018 our defined benefit pension plans were underfunded by $359, of which approximately $336 related to plans outside the United States. Due to the rules affecting tax-deductible contributions in the jurisdictions in which the plans are offered and the impact of future plan asset performance, changes in interest rates and potential changes in legislation in the United States and other foreign jurisdictions, we are not able to reasonably estimate the amounts that may be required to fund defined benefit pension plans.

We believe these accounting policies and the others set forth in Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements are critical to understanding our results of operations and financial condition. Actual results could differ from our estimates and assumptions, and any such differences could be material to our results of operations and financial condition. Inventory ReservesWe maintain reserves for excess and obsolete inventory resulting from the potential inability to sell certain products at prices in excess of current carrying costs. We make estimates regarding the future recoverability of the costs of these products and record provisions based on historical experience, expiration of sterilization dates and expected future trends. If actual product life cycles, product demand or acceptance of new product introductions are less favorable than projected by management, additional inventory write downs may be required, which could unfavorably affect future operating results.Income TaxesOur annual tax rate is determined based on our income, statutory tax rates and the tax impacts of items treated differently for tax purposes than for financial reporting purposes. Tax law requires certain items be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return, and some differences are temporary and reverse over time, such as depreciation expense. These temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities.Deferred tax assets generally represent the tax effect of items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in our income statement. Deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in our financial statements for which payment was deferred, the tax effect of expenditures for which a deduction was taken in our tax return but has not yet been recognized in our financial statements or assets recorded at fair value in business combinations for which there was no corresponding tax basis adjustment.Inherent in determining our annual tax rate are judgments regarding business plans, tax planning opportunities and expectations about future outcomes. Realization of certain deferred tax assets is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction prior to the expiration of the carryforward periods. Although realization is not assured, management believes it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances, will be realized.We operate in multiple jurisdictions with complex tax policy and regulatory environments. In certain of these jurisdictions, we may take tax positions that management believes are supportable but are potentially subject to successful challenge by the applicable taxing authority. These differences of interpretation with the respective governmental taxing authorities can be impacted by the local economic and fiscal environment. We evaluate our tax positions and establish liabilities in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance on uncertainty in income taxes. We review these tax uncertainties in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of tax audits, and adjust them accordingly. We have a number of audits in process in various jurisdictions. Although the resolution of these tax positions is uncertain, based on currently available information, we believe that it is more likely than not that the ultimate outcomes will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.Due to the number of estimates and assumptions inherent in calculating the various components of our tax provision, certain changes or future events, such as changes in tax legislation, geographic mix of earnings, completion of tax audits or earnings repatriation plans, could have an impact on those estimates and our effective tax rate.Acquisitions, Goodwill and Intangibles, and Long-Lived AssetsOur financial statements include the operations of an acquired business starting from the completion of the acquisition. In addition, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded on the date of acquisition at their respective estimated fair values, with any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired recorded as goodwill. Significant judgment is required in estimating the fair value of intangible assets and in assigning their respective useful lives. Accordingly, we typically obtain the assistance of third-party valuation specialists for significant items. The fair value estimates are based on available historical information and on future expectations and assumptions deemed reasonable by management but are inherently uncertain. We typically use an income method to estimate the fair value of intangible assets, which is based on forecasts of the expected future cash flows attributable to the respective assets. Significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the valuations reflect a consideration of other marketplace participants and include the amount and timing of future cash flows (including expected growth rates and profitability), the underlying product or technology life cycles, the economic barriers to entry and the discount rate applied to the cash flows. Unanticipated market or macroeconomic events and circumstances may occur that could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and assumptions. Determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment. With the exception of certain trade names, the majority of our acquired intangible assets (e.g., certain trademarks or brands, customer and distributor relationships, patents and Dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.14STRYKER CORPORATION 2018 FORM 10-Ktechnologies) are expected to have determinable useful lives. Our assessment as to the useful lives of these intangible assets is based on a number of factors including competitive environment, market share, trademark, brand history, underlying product life cycles, operating plans and the macroeconomic environment of the countries in which the trademarked or branded products are sold. Our estimates of the useful lives of determinable-lived intangibles are primarily based on these same factors. Determinable-lived intangible assets are amortized to expense over their estimated useful life. In some of our acquisitions, we acquire in-process research and development (IPRD) intangible assets. For acquisitions accounted for as business combinations IPRD is considered to be an indefinite-lived intangible asset until the research is completed (then it becomes a determinable-lived intangible asset) or determined to have no future use (then it is impaired). For asset acquisitions IPRD is expensed immediately unless there is an alternative future use.The value of indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill is not amortized but is tested at least annually for impairment. Our impairment testing for goodwill is performed separately from our impairment testing of indefinite-lived intangibles. We perform our annual impairment test for goodwill in the fourth quarter of each year. We consider qualitative indicators of the fair value of a reporting unit when it is unlikely that a reporting unit has impaired goodwill. In certain circumstances, we also use a discounted cash flow analysis that requires certain assumptions and estimates be made regarding market conditions and our future profitability. In those circumstances we test goodwill for impairment by reviewing the book value compared to the fair value at the reporting unit level. We test individual indefinite-lived intangibles by reviewing the individual book values compared to the fair value. We determine the fair value of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets based on the income approach. Under the income approach, we calculate the fair value of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. Considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating and macroeconomic changes and to estimate future cash flows to measure fair value. Assumptions used in our impairment evaluations, such as forecasted growth rates and cost of capital, are consistent with internal projections and operating plans. We believe such assumptions and estimates are also comparable to those that would be used by other marketplace participants. We did not recognize any impairment charges for goodwill in the years presented, as our annual impairment testing indicated that all reporting unit goodwill fair values exceeded their respective recorded values. Future changes in the judgments, assumptions and estimates that are used in our impairment testing for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, including discount and tax rates and future cash flow projections, could result in significantly different estimates of the fair values. A significant reduction in the estimated fair values could result in impairment charges that could materially affect our results of operations.We review our other long-lived assets for indicators of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The evaluation is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, which is at the individual asset level or the asset group level. The undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the related assets are estimated over their useful life based on updated projections. If the evaluation indicates that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable, any potential impairment is measured based upon the fair value of the related assets or asset group as determined by an appropriate market appraisal or other valuation technique. Assets classified as held for sale, if any, are recorded at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell. Legal and Other ContingenciesWe are involved in various ongoing proceedings, legal actions and claims arising in the normal course of business, including proceedings related to product, labor and intellectual property, and other matters that are more fully described in Note 7 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. The outcomes of these matters will generally not be known for prolonged periods of time. In certain of the legal proceedings, the claimants seek damages, as well as other compensatory and equitable relief, that could result in the payment of significant claims and settlements and/or the imposition of injunctions or other equitable relief. For legal matters for which management had sufficient information to reasonably estimate our future obligations, a liability representing management's best estimate of the probable loss, or the minimum of the range of probable losses when a best estimate within the range is not known, for the resolution of these legal matters is recorded. The estimates are based on consultation with legal counsel, previous settlement experience and settlement strategies. If actual outcomes are less favorable than those projected by management, additional expense may be incurred, which could unfavorably affect future operating results. We are currently self-insured for product liability-related claims and expenses. The ultimate cost to us with respect to product liability claims could be materially different than the amount of the current estimates and accruals and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTSRefer to Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.ITEM 7A.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.We sell our products globally and, as a result, our financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as weak economic conditions or changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Our operating results are primarily exposed to changes in exchange rates among the United States Dollar, European currencies, in particular the Euro, Swiss Franc and the British Pound, the Japanese Yen, the Australian Dollar and the Canadian Dollar. We develop and manufacture products in the United States, Canada, China, France, Germany, Ireland, Japan, Mexico, Puerto Rico, Sweden, Switzerland and Turkey and incur costs in the applicable local currencies. This global deployment of facilities serves to partially mitigate the impact of currency exchange rate changes on our cost of sales. Refer to Notes 1, 4 and 5 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding our use of derivative instruments to mitigate these risks. A hypothetical 10% change in foreign currencies relative to the United States Dollar would change the December 31, 2018 fair value of these instruments by approximately $334.

310764,SYK,STRYKER CORP,2020,"ITEM 7.MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.Overview of 2019Our goal is to achieve sales growth at the high-end of the medical technology (MedTech) industry and maintain our long-term capital allocation strategy that prioritizes: (1) Acquisitions, (2) Dividends and (3) Share repurchases.In 2019 we achieved reported net sales growth of 9.4%. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, sales grew 8.1% in constant currency. We reported net earnings of $2,083 and net earnings per diluted share of $5.48. Excluding the impact of certain items, we achieved adjusted net earnings of $3,139 and growth of 13.0% in adjusted net earnings per diluted share(1). We continued our capital allocation strategy by investing $802 in acquisitions, paying $778 in dividends to our shareholders and using $307 for share repurchases. In January 2019 we repaid $500 of our senior unsecured notes with a coupon of 1.800% that were due on January 15, 2019. In March 2019 we repaid $750 of our senior unsecured notes with a coupon of 2.000% that were due on March 8, 2019. In December 2019 we issued €2.4 billion senior unsecured notes comprised of €850 of senior unsecured notes with a coupon of 0.250% due December 3, 2024, €800 of senior unsecured notes with a coupon of 0.750% due March 1, 2029 and €750 of senior unsecured notes with a coupon of 1.000% due December 3, 2031. In January 2020 we repaid $500 of senior unsecured notes with a coupon of 4.375% that were due on January 15, 2020. Refer to Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. In 2019 we completed acquisitions for total net cash consideration of $802 and $294 in future milestone payments primarily due upon the achievement of certain regulatory and commercial milestones. In November 2019 we announced a definitive agreement to acquire all of the issued and outstanding ordinary shares of Wright Medical Group N.V. (Wright) for $30.75 per share, or an aggregate purchase price of approximately $5.4 billion (including convertible notes). We expect the acquisition to close in the second half of 2020, subject to the expiration of the waiting period (and any extension thereof) under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, and the receipt of other required approvals and clearances under applicable antitrust laws, the adoption of certain resolutions by Wright’s shareholders and other customary conditions. Wright is a global medical device company focused on extremities and biologics. Following closing, we plan to integrate Wright into our Trauma and Extremities business within Orthopaedics. See Note 6 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.In 2019 we repurchased 1.9 million shares of our common stock at a cost of $307 under our authorized repurchase program. The total dollar value of shares of our common stock that could be acquired under our authorized repurchase program was $1,033 as of December 31, 2019. When we issued the €2.4 billion of senior unsecured notes we also announced our intention to suspend our share repurchase program in 2020 and 2021.(1) Refer to ""Non-GAAP Financial Measures"" for a discussion of non-GAAP financial measures used in this report and a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.

Excluding the impact of the items noted below, expenses decreased to 33.9% in 2018 from 34.8% in 2017 primarily due to leverage from higher sales volumes, the favorable impact from the adoption of ASC 606 and continued focus on our operating expense improvement initiatives, partially offset by the leverage from recent acquisitions.

Refer to Note 7 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.Amortization of Intangible AssetsAmortization of intangible assets was $464, $417 and $371 in 2019, 2018 and 2017. The increase in 2019 and 2018 was due to acquisitions. Refer to Notes 6 and 8 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.Other Income (Expense), NetOther income (expense), net was ($151), ($181) and ($234) in 2019, 2018 and 2017. The decrease in 2019 was primarily due to an increase in interest income due to higher interest rates partially offset by higher interest expense due to higher interest rates and higher debt outstanding. Refer to Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.Income TaxesOur effective tax rate was 18.7%, (50.8)% and 50.6% for 2019, 2018 and 2017. The effective income tax rate for 2019 reflects the tax related to the transfer of intellectual properties between tax jurisdictions and the continued lower effective income tax rates as a result of our European operations.The effective income tax rate for 2018 reflects the tax effect related to the transfer of intellectual properties between tax jurisdictions, the continuing impact of complying with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the Tax Act), and continued lower effective income tax rates as a result of our European operations. The effective income tax rate for 2017 reflects compliance with the Tax Act offset by lower effective income tax rates as a result of our European operations. Net EarningsNet earnings in 2019 decreased to $2,083 or $5.48 per diluted share from $3,553 or $9.34 per diluted share in 2018 and increased from $1,020 or $2.68 per diluted share in 2017. The impact of foreign currency exchange rates reduced net earnings per diluted share by approximately $0.14, $0.06 and $0.07 in 2019, 2018 and 2017.

We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful information to assist investors and shareholders in understanding our financial results and assessing our prospects for future performance. Management believes percentage sales growth in constant currency and the other adjusted measures described above are important indicators of our operations because they exclude items that may not be indicative of or are unrelated to our core operating results and provide a baseline for analyzing trends in our underlying businesses. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures for reviewing the operating results of reportable business segments and analyzing potential future business trends in connection with our budget process and bases certain management incentive compensation on these non-GAAP financial measures. To measure percentage sales growth in constant currency, we remove the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates that affect the comparability and trend of sales. Percentage sales growth in constant currency is calculated by translating current and prior year results at the same foreign currency exchange rate. To measure percentage organic sales growth, we remove the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and acquisitions, which affect the comparability and trend of sales. Percentage organic sales growth is calculated by translating current year results at prior year average foreign currency exchange rates excluding the impact of acquisitions. To measure earnings performance on a consistent and comparable basis, we exclude certain items that affect the comparability of operating results and the trend of earnings. These adjustments are irregular in timing and may not be indicative of our past and future performance. The following are examples of the types of adjustments that may be included in a period:1.Acquisition and integration-related costs. Costs related to integrating recently acquired businesses and specific costs (e.g., inventory step-up and deal costs) related to the consummation of the acquisition process. 2.Amortization of purchased intangible assets. Periodic amortization expense related to purchased intangible assets. 3.Restructuring-related and other charges. Costs associated with the termination of sales relationships in certain countries, workforce reductions, elimination of product lines, weather-related asset impairments and associated costs and other restructuring-related activities.4.Medical Device Regulations. Costs specific to updating our quality system, product labeling, asset write-offs and product remanufacturing to comply with the medical device reporting regulations and other requirements of the European Union and China regulations for medical devices.5.Recall-related matters. Our best estimate of the minimum of the range of probable loss to resolve the Rejuvenate, LFIT V40 and other product recalls.6.Regulatory and legal matters. Our best estimate of the minimum of the range of probable loss to resolve certain regulatory matters and other legal settlements. 7.Tax matters. Charges represent the impact of accounting for certain significant and discrete tax items.Because non-GAAP financial measures are not standardized, it may not be possible to compare these financial measures with other companies' non-GAAP financial measures having the same or similar names. These adjusted financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for reported sales growth, gross profit, selling, general and administrative expenses, research, development and engineering expenses, operating income, other income (expense), net, effective income tax rate, net earnings and net earnings per diluted share, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are an additional way of viewing aspects of our operations when viewed with our GAAP results and the reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures at the end of the discussion of Consolidated Results of Operations below. We strongly encourage investors and shareholders to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure.The weighted-average diluted shares outstanding used in the calculation of non-GAAP net earnings per diluted share are the same as those used in the calculation of reported net earnings per diluted share for the respective period.

Operating cash flow provides the primary source of cash to fund operating needs and capital expenditures. Excess operating cash is used first to fund acquisitions to complement our portfolio of businesses. Other discretionary uses include dividends and share repurchases; however, when we issued the €2.4 billion of senior unsecured notes we announced our intention to suspend our share repurchase program for 2020 and 2021. We supplement operating cash flow with debt to fund our activities as necessary. Our overall cash position reflects our strong business results and a global cash management strategy that takes into account liquidity management, economic factors and tax considerations.Operating ActivitiesCash provided by operations was $2,191, $2,610 and $1,559 in 2019, 2018 and 2017. The decrease from 2018 was primarily due to higher usage of cash from working capital, primarily accounts receivable and inventory, and lower net earnings partially offset by payments related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 and higher recall charges. The net of accounts receivable, inventory and accounts payable resulted in the consumption of $900, $329, and $461 of cash in 2019, 2018 and 2017. Investing ActivitiesCash used in investing activities was $1,455, $2,857 and $1,613 in 2019, 2018 and 2017. The decrease in cash used in 2019 was primarily due to decreased payments for acquisitions, primarily the $360 acquisition of Mobius and $442 related to certain other businesses and related assets. In 2018 we acquired Entellus and K2M. In 2017 we acquired NOVADAQ and certain other businesses and related assets. Financing ActivitiesCash provided by (used in) financing activities was $3, $1,329 and ($794) in 2019, 2018 and 2017. In 2019 the issuance of €2.4 billion of senior unsecured notes was mostly offset by $1,342 repayments on long-term debt, $778 dividends paid and $307 repurchases of our common stock. In January 2020 we repaid $500 of senior unsecured notes with a coupon of 4.375% that were due on January 15, 2020.We maintain debt levels that we consider appropriate after evaluating a number of factors including cash requirements for ongoing operations, investment and financing plans (including acquisitions and share repurchase activities) and overall cost of capital.

We anticipate being able to support our short-term liquidity and operating needs from a variety of sources, including cash from operations, commercial paper and existing credit lines. We raised funds in the capital markets in 2019 and 2018 and may continue to do so from time to time. As a result of the announcement of the planned acquisition of Wright, Standard & Poor's downgraded our corporate credit and long-term issue-level rating to A- from A. Nevertheless, we continue Dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.13STRYKER CORPORATION 2019 FORM 10-Kto have strong investment-grade short-term and long-term debt ratings that we believe should enable us to refinance our debt as it becomes due. We have existing credit facilities should additional funds be required. We have a borrowing capacity available under our main credit facility of $1,500. The amount of commercial paper we have issuable under the commercial paper program is $1,500.Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held in locations outside the United States was approximately 25% and 25% on December 31, 2019 and 2018. We intend to use this cash to expand operations organically and through acquisitions.Guarantees and Other Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsWe do not have guarantees or other off-balance sheet financing arrangements, including variable interest entities, of a magnitude that we believe could have a material impact on our financial condition or liquidity.CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND FORWARD-LOOKING CASH REQUIREMENTSAs further described in Note 7 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, in 2019 we recorded charges to earnings related to the Rejuvenate and ABG II and LFIT Anatomic CoCr V40 Femoral Heads recall matters. Recorded charges represent the minimum of the range of probable cost to resolve these matters. The final outcome of these matters is dependent on many variables that are difficult to predict. The ultimate cost to entirely resolve these matters may be materially different than the amount of the current estimates and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. We are not able to reasonably estimate the future periods in which payments will be made.As further described in Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, on December 31, 2019 we had a reserve for uncertain income tax positions of $472. Due to uncertainties regarding the ultimate resolution of income tax audits, we are not able to reasonably estimate the future periods in which any income tax payments to settle these uncertain income tax positions will be made.As further described in Note 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, on December 31, 2019 our defined benefit pension plans were underfunded by $441, of which approximately $434 related to plans outside the United States. Due to the rules affecting tax-deductible contributions in the jurisdictions in which the plans are offered and the impact of future plan asset performance, changes in interest rates and potential changes in legislation in the United States and other foreign jurisdictions, we are not able to reasonably estimate the amounts that may be required to fund defined benefit pension plans.

We believe these accounting policies and the others set forth in Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements are critical to understanding our results of operations and financial condition. Actual results could differ from our estimates and assumptions, and any such differences could be material to our results of operations and financial condition. Inventory ReservesWe maintain reserves for excess and obsolete inventory resulting from the potential inability to sell certain products at prices in excess of current carrying costs. We make estimates regarding the future recoverability of the costs of these products and record provisions based on historical experience, expiration of sterilization dates and expected future trends. If actual product life cycles, product demand or acceptance of new product introductions are less favorable than projected by management, additional inventory write downs may be required, which could unfavorably affect future operating results.Income TaxesOur annual tax rate is determined based on our income, statutory tax rates and the tax impacts of items treated differently for tax purposes than for financial reporting purposes. Tax law requires certain items be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return, and some differences are temporary and reverse over time, such as depreciation expense. These temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities.Deferred tax assets generally represent the tax effect of items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in our income statement. Deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in our financial statements for which payment was deferred, the tax effect of expenditures for which a deduction was taken in our tax return but has not yet been recognized in our financial statements or assets recorded at fair value in business combinations for which there was no corresponding tax basis adjustment.Inherent in determining our annual tax rate are judgments regarding business plans, tax planning opportunities and expectations about future outcomes. Realization of certain deferred tax assets is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction prior to the expiration of the carryforward periods. Although realization is not assured, management believes it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances, will be realized.We operate in multiple jurisdictions with complex tax policy and regulatory environments. In certain of these jurisdictions, we may take tax positions that management believes are supportable but are potentially subject to successful challenge by the applicable taxing authority. These differences of interpretation with the respective governmental taxing authorities can be impacted by the local economic and fiscal environment. We evaluate our tax positions and establish liabilities in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance on uncertainty in income taxes. We review these tax uncertainties in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of tax audits, and adjust them accordingly. We have a number of audits in process in various jurisdictions. Although the resolution of these tax positions is uncertain, based on currently available information, we believe that it is more likely than not that the ultimate outcomes will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.Due to the number of estimates and assumptions inherent in calculating the various components of our tax provision, certain changes or future events, such as changes in tax legislation, geographic mix of earnings, completion of tax audits or earnings Dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.14STRYKER CORPORATION 2019 FORM 10-Krepatriation plans, could have an impact on those estimates and our effective tax rate.Acquisitions, Goodwill and Intangibles, and Long-Lived AssetsOur financial statements include the operations of an acquired business starting from the completion of the acquisition. In addition, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded on the date of acquisition at their respective estimated fair values, with any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired recorded as goodwill. Significant judgment is required in estimating the fair value of intangible assets and in assigning their respective useful lives. Accordingly, we typically obtain the assistance of third-party valuation specialists for significant items. The fair value estimates are based on available historical information and on future expectations and assumptions deemed reasonable by management but are inherently uncertain. We typically use an income method to estimate the fair value of intangible assets, which is based on forecasts of the expected future cash flows attributable to the respective assets. Significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the valuations reflect a consideration of other marketplace participants and include the amount and timing of future cash flows (including expected growth rates and profitability), the underlying product or technology life cycles, the economic barriers to entry and the discount rate applied to the cash flows. Unanticipated market or macroeconomic events and circumstances may occur that could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and assumptions. Determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment. With the exception of certain trade names, the majority of our acquired intangible assets (e.g., certain trademarks or brands, customer and distributor relationships, patents and technologies) are expected to have determinable useful lives. Our assessment as to the useful lives of these intangible assets is based on a number of factors including competitive environment, market share, trademark, brand history, underlying product life cycles, operating plans and the macroeconomic environment of the countries in which the trademarked or branded products are sold. Our estimates of the useful lives of determinable-lived intangibles are primarily based on these same factors. Determinable-lived intangible assets are amortized to expense over their estimated useful life. In some of our acquisitions, we acquire in-process research and development (IPRD) intangible assets. For acquisitions accounted for as business combinations IPRD is considered to be an indefinite-lived intangible asset until the research is completed (then it becomes a determinable-lived intangible asset) or determined to have no future use (then it is impaired). For asset acquisitions IPRD is expensed immediately unless there is an alternative future use.The value of indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill is not amortized but is tested at least annually for impairment. Our impairment testing for goodwill is performed separately from our impairment testing of indefinite-lived intangibles. We perform our annual impairment test for goodwill in the fourth quarter of each year. We consider qualitative indicators of the fair value of a reporting unit when it is unlikely that a reporting unit has impaired goodwill. In certain circumstances, we also use a discounted cash flow analysis that requires certain assumptions and estimates be made regarding market conditions and our future profitability. In those circumstances we test goodwill for impairment by reviewing the book value compared to the fair value at the reporting unit level. We test individual indefinite-lived intangibles by reviewing the individual book values compared to the fair value. We determine the fair value of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets based on the income approach. Under the income approach, we calculate the fair value of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. Considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating and macroeconomic changes and to estimate future cash flows to measure fair value. Assumptions used in our impairment evaluations, such as forecasted growth rates and cost of capital, are consistent with internal projections and operating plans. We believe such assumptions and estimates are also comparable to those that would be used by other marketplace participants. We did not recognize any impairment charges for goodwill in the years presented, as our annual impairment testing indicated that all reporting unit goodwill fair values exceeded their respective recorded values. Future changes in the judgments, assumptions and estimates that are used in our impairment testing for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, including discount and tax rates and future cash flow projections, could result in significantly different estimates of the fair values. A significant reduction in the estimated fair values could result in impairment charges that could materially affect our results of operations.We review our other long-lived assets for indicators of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The evaluation is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, which is at the individual asset level or the asset group level. The undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the related assets are estimated over their useful life based on updated projections. If the evaluation indicates that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable, any potential impairment is measured based upon the fair value of the related assets or asset group as determined by an appropriate market appraisal or other valuation technique. Assets classified as held for sale, if any, are recorded at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell. Legal and Other ContingenciesWe are involved in various ongoing proceedings, legal actions and claims arising in the normal course of business, including proceedings related to product, labor and intellectual property, and other matters that are more fully described in Note 7 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. The outcomes of these matters will generally not be known for prolonged periods of time. In certain of the legal proceedings, the claimants seek damages, as well as other compensatory and equitable relief, that could result in the payment of significant claims and settlements and/or the imposition of injunctions or other equitable relief. For legal matters for which management had sufficient information to reasonably estimate our future obligations, a liability representing management's best estimate of the probable loss, or the minimum of the range of probable losses when a best estimate within the range is not known, for the resolution of these legal matters is recorded. The estimates are based on consultation with legal counsel, previous settlement experience and settlement strategies. If actual outcomes are less favorable than those projected by management, additional expense may be incurred, which could unfavorably affect future operating results. We are currently self-insured for product liability-related claims and expenses. The ultimate cost to us with respect to product liability claims could be materially different than the amount of the current estimates and accruals and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTSRefer to Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.Dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.15ITEM 7A.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.We sell our products globally and, as a result, our financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as weak economic conditions or changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Our operating results are primarily exposed to changes in exchange rates among the United States Dollar, European currencies, in particular the Euro, Swiss Franc and the British Pound, the Japanese Yen, the Australian Dollar and the Canadian Dollar. We develop and manufacture products in the United States, Canada, China, France, Germany, Ireland, Japan, Mexico, Puerto Rico, Sweden, Switzerland and Turkey and incur costs in the applicable local currencies. This global deployment of facilities serves to partially mitigate the impact of currency exchange rate changes on our cost of sales. Refer to Notes 1, 4 and 5 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding our use of derivative instruments to mitigate these risks. A hypothetical 10% change in foreign currencies relative to the United States Dollar would change the December 31, 2019 fair value of these instruments by approximately $523.",2023-12-30 18:43:19.440897
310764,SYK,STRYKER CORP,2021,"ITEM 7.MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.About StrykerStryker is one of the world's leading medical technology companies and, together with our customers, we are driven to make healthcare better. We offer innovative products and services in Orthopaedics, Medical and Surgical, and Neurotechnology and Spine that help improve patient and hospital outcomes. Our goal is to achieve sales growth at the high-end of the medical technology (MedTech) industry and maintain our long-term capital allocation strategy that prioritizes: (1) Acquisitions, (2) Dividends and (3) Share repurchases.COVID-19 PandemicThe COVID-19 global pandemic has led to severe disruptions in the market and the global and United States economies that may continue for a prolonged duration and trigger a recession or a period of economic slowdown. In response, various governmental authorities and private enterprises have implemented numerous measures to contain the pandemic, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders and shutdowns. A significant number of our global suppliers, vendors, distributors and manufacturing facilities are located in regions that have been affected by the pandemic. Those operations have been materially adversely affected by restrictive government and private enterprise measures implemented in response to the pandemic.Some of our products are particularly sensitive to reductions in elective medical procedures. Elective medical procedures were suspended in the first quarter of 2020 in many of the markets where our products are marketed and sold, which negatively affected our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations. While we saw progressive improvement in the second and third quarters, to the extent individuals are required to continue to de-prioritize or delay elective procedures as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise, as we experienced in the fourth quarter, our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations could be negatively affected. Overview of 2020The response to the COVID-19 pandemic has included unprecedented measures to slow the spread of the virus taken by local governments and health care authorities globally, including the postponement of elective medical procedures and social contact restrictions, which have had, and could continue to have, a significant negative impact on Stryker’s operations and financial results. In 2020 reported net sales declined 3.6%. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, sales declined 4.8% in constant currency. We reported net earnings of $1,599 and net earnings per diluted share of $4.20. Excluding the impact of certain items, we achieved adjusted net earnings(1) of $2,827 and adjusted net earnings per diluted share(1) of $7.43 representing a decline of 10.0%. We continued our capital allocation strategy by investing $4,222 in acquisitions and paying $863 in dividends to our shareholders. In 2020 we received $3,292 from issuance of debt and had total debt repayments of $2,297. We exercised our right under the acquisition clause of our credit and term loan facilities to increase the maximum permitted leverage to 5.0:1 effective as of December 31, 2020. Refer to Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.In 2020 we completed acquisitions for total net cash consideration of $4,222 and $82 in future milestone payments primarily due upon the achievement of certain regulatory and commercial milestones.

We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful information to assist investors and shareholders in understanding our financial results and assessing our prospects for future performance. Management believes percentage sales growth in constant currency and the other adjusted measures described above are important indicators of our operations because they exclude items that may not be indicative of or are unrelated to our core operating results and provide a baseline for analyzing trends in our underlying businesses. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures for reviewing the operating results of reportable business segments and analyzing potential future business trends in connection with our budget process and bases certain management incentive compensation on these non-GAAP financial measures. To measure percentage sales growth in constant currency, we remove the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates that affect the comparability and trend of sales. Percentage sales growth in constant currency is calculated by translating current and prior year results at the same foreign currency exchange rate. To measure percentage organic sales growth, we remove the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and acquisitions, which affect the comparability and trend of sales. Percentage organic sales growth is calculated by translating current year results at prior year average foreign currency exchange rates excluding the impact of acquisitions. To measure earnings performance on a consistent and comparable basis, we exclude certain items that affect the comparability of operating results and the trend of earnings. These adjustments are irregular in timing and may not be indicative of our past and future performance. The following are examples of the types of adjustments that may be included in a period:1.Acquisition and integration-related costs. Costs related to integrating recently acquired businesses and specific costs (e.g., inventory step-up and deal costs) related to the consummation of the acquisition process.2.Amortization of purchased intangible assets. Periodic amortization expense related to purchased intangible assets. 3.Restructuring-related and other charges. Costs associated with the termination of sales relationships in certain countries, workforce reductions, elimination of product lines, certain long-lived asset impairments and associated costs and other restructuring-related activities.4.Medical Device Regulations. Costs specific to updating our quality system, product labeling, asset write-offs and product remanufacturing to comply with the medical device reporting regulations and other requirements of the European Union and China regulations for medical devices.5.Recall-related matters. Our best estimate of the minimum of the range of probable loss to resolve the Rejuvenate, LFIT V40 and other product recalls.6.Regulatory and legal matters. Our best estimate of the minimum of the range of probable loss to resolve certain regulatory matters and other legal settlements. 7.Tax matters. Charges represent the impact of accounting for certain significant and discrete tax items.To measure free cash flow, we adjust cash provided by operating activities by the amount of purchases of property, plant and equipment and proceeds from long-lived asset disposals and remove the impact of certain legal settlements and recall payments. To measure free cash flow conversion we divide free cash flow by adjusted net earnings.Because non-GAAP financial measures are not standardized, it may not be possible to compare these financial measures with other companies' non-GAAP financial measures having the same or similar names. These adjusted financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for reported sales growth, gross profit, selling, general and administrative expenses, Dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.14STRYKER CORPORATION 2020 FORM 10-Kresearch, development and engineering expenses, operating income, other income (expense), net, effective income tax rate, net earnings and net earnings per diluted share, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.

Other discretionary uses include dividends and share repurchases; however, in 2019 we announced our intention to suspend our share repurchase program for 2020 and 2021. We supplement operating cash flow with debt to fund our activities as necessary. Our overall cash position reflects our business results and a global cash management strategy that takes into account liquidity management, economic factors and tax considerations.Operating ActivitiesCash provided by operating activities was $3,277, $2,191 and $2,610 in 2020, 2019 and 2018. The increase from 2019 was primarily due to cash from working capital, including higher accounts receivable collections, less spending on inventory due to lower production from lower sales and an increase in our accounts payable, partially offset by decreased net earnings. Investing ActivitiesCash used in investing activities was $4,701, $1,455 and $2,857 in 2020, 2019 and 2018. The increase in cash used in 2020 was primarily due to the acquisition of Wright and OrthoSensor. In 2019 we acquired Mobius and certain other businesses and related assets. In 2018 we acquired Entellus and K2M.Financing ActivitiesCash provided by (used in) financing activities was ($11), $3 and $1,329 in 2020, 2019 and 2018. The change in cash was primarily driven by securing a $400 term loan in November 2020, the issuance of $600 of notes in November 2020 and $2,300 of notes in June 2020, offset by total debt repayments of $2,297 and dividend payments of $863 in 2020. This is compared to the issuance of €2.4 billion of notes in November 2019 and repayments of $1,342 of debt, dividend payments of $778 and share repurchases of $307 in 2019. Share repurchases were suspended in 2020.We maintain debt levels that we consider appropriate after evaluating a number of factors including cash requirements for ongoing operations, investment and financing plans (including acquisitions and share repurchase activities) and overall cost of capital.

Despite the impact from the COVID-19 pandemic, we anticipate being able to support our short-term liquidity and operating needs from a variety of sources including cash from operations, commercial paper, existing credit lines and capital expenditure and operating expense reductions. We maintain a revolving credit facility with $1.5 billion of committed capital which expires in August 2023 and a $1.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility that matures in April 2021.We raised funds in the capital markets in 2020, 2019 and 2018 and may continue to do so from time-to-time. We continue to have strong investment-grade short-term and long-term debt ratings that we believe should enable us to refinance our debt as needed.Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held in locations outside the United States was approximately 30% and 25% on December 31, 2020 and 2019. We intend to use this cash to expand operations organically and through acquisitions.Guarantees and Other Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsWe do not have guarantees or other off-balance sheet financing arrangements, including variable interest entities, of a magnitude that we believe could have a material impact on our financial condition or liquidity.CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND FORWARD-LOOKING CASH REQUIREMENTSAs further described in Note 7 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, in 2020 we recorded charges to earnings related to the Rejuvenate and ABG II, LFIT Anatomic CoCr V40 Femoral Heads recall matters and recorded product liabilities relating to Wright legacy hip products claims. Recorded reserves represent the minimum of the range of probable cost remaining to resolve these matters. The final outcome of these matters is dependent on many variables that are difficult to predict. The ultimate cost to entirely resolve these matters may be materially different from the amount of the current estimates and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. We are not able to reasonably estimate the future periods in which payments will be made.As further described in Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, on December 31, 2020 we had a reserve for uncertain income tax positions of $457. Due to uncertainties regarding the ultimate resolution of income tax audits, we are not able to reasonably estimate the future periods in which any income tax payments to settle these uncertain income tax positions will be made.As further described in Note 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, on December 31, 2020 our defined benefit pension plans were underfunded by $596, of which approximately $588 related to plans outside the United States. Due to the rules affecting tax-deductible contributions in the jurisdictions in which the plans are offered and the impact of future plan asset performance, changes in interest rates and potential changes in legislation in the United States and other foreign jurisdictions, we are not able to reasonably estimate the amounts that may be required to fund defined benefit pension plans.

We believe these accounting policies and the others set forth in Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements are critical to understanding our results of operations and financial condition. Actual results could differ from our estimates and assumptions, and any such differences could be material to our results of operations and financial condition. Inventory ReservesWe maintain reserves for excess and obsolete inventory resulting from the potential inability to sell certain products at prices in excess of current carrying costs. We make estimates regarding the future recoverability of the costs of these products and record provisions based on historical experience, expiration of sterilization dates and expected future trends. If actual product life cycles, product demand or acceptance of new product introductions are less favorable than projected by management, additional inventory write downs may be required, which could unfavorably affect future operating results.Income TaxesOur annual tax rate is determined based on our income, statutory tax rates and the tax impacts of items treated differently for tax purposes than for financial reporting purposes. Tax law requires certain items be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return, and some differences are temporary and reverse over time, such as depreciation expense. These temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities.Deferred tax assets generally represent the tax effect of items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in our income statement. Deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in our financial statements for which payment was deferred, the tax effect of expenditures for which a deduction was taken in our tax return but has not yet been recognized in our financial statements or assets recorded at fair value in business combinations for which there was no corresponding tax basis adjustment.Inherent in determining our annual tax rate are judgments regarding business plans, tax planning opportunities and expectations about future outcomes. Realization of certain deferred tax assets is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction prior to the expiration of the carryforward periods. Although realization is not assured, management believes it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances, will be realized.We operate in multiple jurisdictions with complex tax policy and regulatory environments. In certain of these jurisdictions, we may take tax positions that management believes are supportable but are potentially subject to successful challenge by the applicable taxing authority. These differences of interpretation with the respective governmental taxing authorities can be impacted by the local economic and fiscal environment. We evaluate our tax positions and establish liabilities in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance on uncertainty in income taxes. We review these tax uncertainties in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of tax audits, and adjust them accordingly. We have a number of audits in process in various jurisdictions. Although the resolution of these tax positions is uncertain, based on currently available information, we believe that it is more likely than not that the ultimate outcomes will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.Due to the number of estimates and assumptions inherent in calculating the various components of our tax provision, certain changes or future events, such as changes in tax legislation, geographic mix of earnings, completion of tax audits or earnings repatriation plans, could have an impact on those estimates and our effective tax rate.Acquisitions, Goodwill and Intangibles, and Long-Lived AssetsOur financial statements include the operations of an acquired business starting from the completion of the acquisition. In addition, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded on the date of acquisition at their respective estimated fair values, with any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired recorded as goodwill. Significant judgment is required in estimating the fair value of intangible assets and in assigning their respective useful lives. Accordingly, we typically obtain the assistance of third-party valuation specialists for significant items. The fair value estimates are based on available historical information and on future expectations and assumptions deemed reasonable by management but are inherently uncertain. We typically use an income method to estimate the fair value of intangible assets, which is based on forecasts of the expected future cash flows attributable to the respective assets. Significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the valuations reflect a consideration of other marketplace participants and include the amount and timing of future cash flows (including expected growth rates and profitability), the underlying product or technology life cycles, the economic barriers to entry and the discount rate applied to the cash flows. Unanticipated market or macroeconomic events and circumstances may occur that could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and assumptions. Determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment. With the exception of certain trade names, the majority of our acquired intangible assets (e.g., certain trademarks or brands, customer and distributor relationships, patents and technologies) are expected to have determinable useful lives. Our assessment as to the useful lives of these intangible assets is based on a number of factors including competitive environment, market share, trademark, brand history, underlying product life cycles, operating plans and the macroeconomic environment of the countries in which the trademarked or branded products are sold. Our estimates of the useful lives of determinable-lived intangibles are primarily based on these same factors. Determinable-lived intangible assets are amortized to expense over their estimated useful life. In some of our acquisitions, we acquire in-process research and development (IPRD) intangible assets. For acquisitions accounted for as business combinations IPRD is considered to be an indefinite-lived intangible asset until the research is completed (then it becomes a determinable-lived intangible asset) or determined to have no future use (then it is impaired). For asset acquisitions IPRD is expensed immediately unless there is an alternative future use.The value of indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill is not amortized but is tested at least annually for impairment. Our impairment testing for goodwill is performed separately from our impairment testing of indefinite-lived intangibles. We perform our annual impairment test for goodwill in the fourth quarter of each Dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.17STRYKER CORPORATION 2020 FORM 10-Kyear. We consider qualitative indicators of the fair value of a reporting unit when it is unlikely that a reporting unit has impaired goodwill. In certain circumstances, we also use a discounted cash flow analysis that requires certain assumptions and estimates be made regarding market conditions and our future profitability. In those circumstances we test goodwill for impairment by reviewing the book value compared to the fair value at the reporting unit level. We test individual indefinite-lived intangibles by reviewing the individual book values compared to the fair value. We determine the fair value of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets based on the income approach. Under the income approach, we calculate the fair value of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. Considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating and macroeconomic changes and to estimate future cash flows to measure fair value. Assumptions used in our impairment evaluations, such as forecasted growth rates and cost of capital, are consistent with internal projections and operating plans. We believe such assumptions and estimates are also comparable to those that would be used by other marketplace participants. Our annual impairment testing indicated that all reporting unit goodwill fair values significantly exceeded their respective recorded values. Future changes in the judgments, assumptions and estimates that are used in our impairment testing for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, including discount and tax rates and future cash flow projections, could result in significantly different estimates of the fair values. A significant reduction in the estimated fair values could result in impairment charges that could materially affect our results of operations.We review our other long-lived assets for indicators of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The evaluation is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, which is at the individual asset level or the asset group level. The undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the related assets are estimated over their useful life based on updated projections. If the evaluation indicates that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable, any potential impairment is measured based upon the fair value of the related assets or asset group as determined by an appropriate market appraisal or other valuation technique. Assets classified as held for sale, if any, are recorded at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell. Legal and Other ContingenciesWe are involved in various ongoing proceedings, legal actions and claims arising in the normal course of business, including proceedings related to product, labor and intellectual property, and other matters that are more fully described in Note 7 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. The outcomes of these matters will generally not be known for prolonged periods of time. In certain of the legal proceedings, the claimants seek damages, as well as other compensatory and equitable relief, that could result in the payment of significant claims and settlements and/or the imposition of injunctions or other equitable relief. For legal matters for which management had sufficient information to reasonably estimate our future obligations, a liability representing management's best estimate of the probable loss, or the minimum of the range of probable losses when a best estimate within the range is not known, for the resolution of these legal matters is recorded. The estimates are based on consultation with legal counsel, previous settlement experience and settlement strategies. If actual outcomes are less favorable than those projected by management, additional expense may be incurred, which could unfavorably affect future operating results. We are currently self-insured for certain claims and expenses. The ultimate cost to us with respect to product liability claims could be materially different than the amount of the current estimates and accruals and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTSRefer to Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.ITEM 7A.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.We sell our products globally and, as a result, our financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as market risk exposure from weak economic conditions, exchange rate risk and the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations and financial results. Our operating results are primarily exposed to changes in exchange rates among the United States Dollar, Australian Dollar, British Pound, Canadian Dollar, Euro and Japanese Yen. We develop and manufacture products in the United States, Canada, China, France, Germany, Ireland, Japan, Mexico, Puerto Rico, Switzerland and Turkey and incur costs in the applicable local currencies. This global deployment of facilities serves to partially mitigate the impact of currency exchange rate changes on our cost of sales. Refer to Notes 1, 4 and 5 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding our use of derivative instruments to mitigate these risks. A hypothetical 10% change in foreign currencies relative to the United States Dollar would change the December 31, 2020 fair value of these instruments by approximately $550. We are not able to quantify the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our financial results.

310764,SYK,STRYKER CORP,2022,"ITEM 7.MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.About StrykerStryker is one of the world's leading medical technology companies and, together with our customers, we are driven to make healthcare better. We offer innovative products and services in Medical and Surgical, Neurotechnology, Orthopaedics and Spine that help improve patient and hospital outcomes. Our goal is to achieve sales growth at the high-end of the medical technology (MedTech) industry and maintain our long-term capital allocation strategy that prioritizes: (1) Acquisitions, (2) Dividends and (3) Share repurchases.COVID-19 PandemicThe COVID-19 pandemic has led to severe disruptions in the market and the global and United States economies that may continue for a prolonged duration and trigger a recession or a period of economic slowdown. In response, various governmental authorities and private enterprises have implemented numerous measures to contain the pandemic, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders and shutdowns. A significant number of our customers, global suppliers, vendors, distributors and manufacturing facilities are located in regions that have been affected by the pandemic. Those operations have been materially adversely affected by restrictive government and private enterprise measures implemented in response to the pandemic.Some of our products are particularly sensitive to reductions in elective medical procedures. Elective medical procedures were suspended in the first quarter of 2020 in many of the markets where our products are marketed and sold, which negatively affected our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations through the first quarter of 2021. In the second quarter of 2021 we saw partial recovery of elective procedures in most geographies; however, in the third quarter of 2021 we saw hospitalization rates increase, especially in the United States, as a result of the Delta variant. This, along with the Omicron variant, has continued to adversely impact elective procedures and increased inflationary pressure on our gross margin, including an increase in freight and transportation costs as well as increased absenteeism in the fourth quarter of 2021. Overview of 2021In 2021 we achieved reported net sales growth of 19.2%. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, sales grew 12.6% in constant currency. We reported net earnings of $1,994 and net earnings per diluted share of $5.21. Excluding the impact of certain items, we achieved adjusted net earnings(1) of $3,474 and adjusted net earnings per diluted share(1) of $9.09 representing growth of 22.3%. Effective December 31, 2021 we changed our reportable business segments to (i) MedSurg and Neurotechnology and (ii) Orthopaedics and Spine to align to our new internal reporting structure. Refer to Note 14 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.We continued our capital allocation strategy by investing $339 in acquisitions and paying $950 in dividends to our shareholders. In 2021 we had total long-term debt repayments of $1,151. In October 2021 we entered into a new revolving credit agreement that replaces our previous agreement dated August 19, 2016. Refer to Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.In 2021 we completed acquisitions for total net cash consideration of $339 and $54 in future milestone payments primarily due upon the achievement of certain regulatory and commercial milestones. In September 2021 we completed the acquisition of Gauss Surgical, Inc. (Gauss) for $120 in cash and up to $40 in future milestone payments. Gauss is a medical device company that has developed Triton, an artificial intelligence-enabled platform for real-time monitoring of blood loss during surgery. Gauss is part of our Instruments business within MedSurg and Neurotechnology. In January 2022 we announced a definitive merger agreement to acquire all of the issued and outstanding common shares of Vocera Communications, Inc. (Vocera) for $79.25 per share, or an aggregate purchase price of approximately $3.1 billion (including convertible notes). Refer to Note 6 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.In 2021 we did not repurchase any shares of our common stock under our authorized repurchase program. The total dollar value of shares of our common stock that could be acquired under our authorized repurchase program was $1,033 as of December 31, 2021. In 2021 we recorded asset impairments of $264, $105 for certain long-lived and intangible assets related to the China volume-based procurement program and the remaining consisting primarily of in-process research and development, other intangible assets and property, plant and equipment as a result of COVID-19-related demand impacts on in-process product development and certain other divestiture and restructuring activities.

The increase in net expense in 2021 was primarily due to increased interest expense driven by the additional debt from the bond offerings completed in June 2020 and November 2020. Refer to Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.Income TaxesOur effective tax rate was 12.6%, 18.2% and 18.7% for 2021, 2020 and 2019. The effective income tax rate for 2021 reflects the continued lower effective income tax rates as a result of our European operations, certain discrete tax benefits, the tax effect related to the transfer of intellectual property between tax jurisdictions and the tax effect of future remittances of the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries. The effective income tax rate for 2020 and 2019 reflects the tax effect related to the transfer of intellectual properties between tax jurisdictions, the effective income tax rates as a result of our European operations and the tax effect of future remittances of the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries.Net EarningsNet earnings increased to $1,994 or $5.21 per diluted share from $1,599 or $4.20 per diluted share in 2020 and decreased from $2,083 or $5.48 per diluted share in 2019. Adjusted net earnings per diluted share(1) of $9.09 increased 22.3% from $7.43 in 2020 compared to $8.26 in 2019. The impact of foreign currency exchange rates increased net earnings per diluted share by approximately $0.19 in 2021 and reduced net earnings per diluted share by approximately $0.02 and $0.14 in 2020 and 2019.Percent Net Sales 202120202019202120202019Reported $1,994 $1,599 $2,083 11.7 %11.1 %14.0 %Inventory stepped up to fair value203 36 51 1.2 0.3 0.3 Other acquisition and integration-related244 157 160 1.4 1.1 1.1 Amortization of intangible assets489 381 375 2.9 2.6 2.6 Restructuring-related and other charges345 397 180 2.0 2.8 1.2 Medical device regulations90 63 48 0.5 0.4 0.3 Recall-related matters89 13 154 0.5 0.1 1.0 Regulatory and legal matters(12)8 (33)(0.1)0.1 (0.2)Tax matters32 173 121 0.2 1.2 0.8 Adjusted $3,474 $2,827 $3,139 20.3 %19.7 %21.1 %Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresWe supplement the reporting of our financial information determined under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) with certain non-GAAP financial measures, including percentage sales growth in constant currency; percentage organic sales growth; adjusted gross profit; adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses; adjusted research, development and engineering expenses; adjusted operating income; adjusted other income (expense), net; adjusted effective income tax rate; adjusted net earnings; adjusted net earnings per diluted share (Diluted EPS); free cash flow; and free cash flow conversion. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful information to assist investors and shareholders in understanding our financial results and assessing our prospects for future performance. Management believes percentage sales growth in constant currency and the other adjusted measures described above are important indicators of our operations because they exclude items that may not be indicative of or are unrelated to our core operating results and provide a baseline for analyzing trends in our underlying businesses. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures for reviewing the operating results of reportable business segments and analyzing potential future business trends in connection with our budget process and bases certain management incentive compensation on these non-GAAP financial measures. To measure percentage sales growth in constant currency, we remove the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates that affect the comparability and trend of sales. Percentage sales growth in constant currency is calculated by translating current and prior year results at the same foreign currency exchange rate. To measure percentage organic sales growth, we remove the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, acquisitions and divestitures, which affect the comparability and trend of sales. Percentage organic sales growth is calculated by translating current year and prior year results at the same foreign currency exchange rates excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures. To measure earnings performance on a consistent and comparable basis, we exclude certain items that affect the comparability of operating results and the trend of earnings. To measure free cash flow, we adjust cash provided by operating activities by the amount of purchases of property, plant and equipment and proceeds from long-lived asset disposals and remove the impact of certain legal settlements and recall payments. To measure free cash flow conversion we divide free cash flow by adjusted net earnings. These adjustments are irregular in timing and may not be Dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.15STRYKER CORPORATION 2021 FORM 10-Kindicative of our past and future performance. The following are examples of the types of adjustments that may be included in a period:1.Acquisition and integration-related costs. Costs related to integrating recently acquired businesses (e.g., costs associated with the termination of sales relationships, workforce reductions and other integration-related activities) and specific costs (e.g., inventory step-up and deal costs) related to the consummation of the acquisition process.2.Amortization of purchased intangible assets. Periodic amortization expense related to purchased intangible assets. 3.Restructuring-related and other charges. Costs associated with the termination of sales relationships in certain countries, workforce reductions, elimination of product lines, certain long-lived and intangible asset impairments and associated costs and other restructuring-related activities.4.Medical device regulations. Costs specific to updating our quality system, product labeling, asset write-offs and product remanufacturing to comply with the new medical device reporting regulations and other requirements of the European Union and the more stringent regulations for medical devices in China.5.Recall-related matters. Our best estimate of the minimum of the range of probable loss to resolve the Rejuvenate, LFIT V40 and other product recalls.6.Regulatory and legal matters. Our best estimate of the minimum of the range of probable loss to resolve certain regulatory matters and other legal settlements. 7.Tax matters. Charges represent the impact of accounting for certain significant and discrete tax items.Because non-GAAP financial measures are not standardized, it may not be possible to compare these financial measures with other companies' non-GAAP financial measures having the same or similar names. These adjusted financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for reported sales growth, gross profit, selling, general and administrative expenses, research, development and engineering expenses, operating income, other income (expense), net, effective income tax rate, net earnings and net earnings per diluted share, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are an additional way of viewing aspects of our operations when viewed with our GAAP results and the reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures at the end of the discussion of Consolidated Results of Operations below. We strongly encourage investors and shareholders to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure.The weighted-average diluted shares outstanding used in the calculation of non-GAAP net earnings per diluted share are the same as those used in the calculation of reported net earnings per diluted share for the respective period.Reconciliation of the Most Directly Comparable GAAP Financial Measure to Non-GAAP Financial Measure2021Gross ProfitSelling, General & Administrative ExpensesResearch, Development & Engineering ExpensesOperating IncomeOther Income (Expense), NetNet EarningsEffectiveTax RateDiluted EPSReported$10,968 $6,427 $1,235 $2,584 $(303)$1,994 12.6 %$5.21 Acquisition and integration-related costs:Inventory stepped-up to fair value266 — — 266 — 203 1.0 0.53 Other acquisition and integration-related— (319)— 319 — 244 1.2 0.64 Amortization of purchased intangible assets— — — 619 — 489 1.6 1.28 Restructuring-related and other charges28 (358)— 386 11 345 (0.3)0.90 Medical device regulations5 — (102)107 — 90 — 0.24 Recall-related matters— — — 103 — 89 — 0.23 Regulatory and legal matters— 2 — (2)(7)(12)0.2 (0.02)Tax matters— — — — — 32 (1.4)0.08 Adjusted$11,267 $5,752 $1,133 $4,382 $(299)$3,474 14.9 %$9.09 2020Gross ProfitSelling, General & Administrative ExpensesResearch, Development & Engineering ExpensesOperating IncomeOther Income (Expense), NetNet EarningsEffectiveTax RateDiluted EPSReported$9,057 $5,361 $984 $2,223 $(269)$1,599 18.2 %$4.20 Acquisition and integration-related costs:Inventory stepped-up to fair value48 — — 48 — 36 0.3 0.10 Other acquisition and integration-related— (194)— 194 — 157 0.7 0.41 Amortization of purchased intangible assets— — — 472 — 381 1.6 1.00 Restructuring-related and other charges53 (406)— 458 — 397 0.2 1.04 Medical device regulations2 — (79)81 — 63 0.4 0.17 Recall-related matters— — — 17 — 13 0.1 0.03 Regulatory and legal matters— (6)— 6 — 8 (0.1)0.02 Tax matters— — — — 4 173 (8.8)0.46 Adjusted$9,160 $4,755 $905 $3,499 $(265)$2,827 12.6 %$7.43 Dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.16STRYKER CORPORATION 2021 FORM 10-K2019Gross ProfitSelling, General & Administrative ExpensesResearch, Development & Engineering ExpensesOperating IncomeOther Income (Expense), NetNet EarningsEffectiveTax RateDiluted EPSReported$9,696 $5,356 $971 $2,713 $(151)$2,083 18.7 %$5.48 Acquisition and integration-related costs:Inventory stepped-up to fair value67 — — 67 — 51 0.2 0.13 Other acquisition and integration-related— (208)— 208 — 160 0.6 0.42 Amortization of purchased intangible assets— — — 464 — 375 0.6 0.99 Restructuring-related and other charges38 (188)— 226 — 180 0.4 0.47 Medical device regulations6 — (56)62 — 48 0.2 0.13 Recall-related matters— — — 192 — 154 0.3 0.41 Regulatory and legal matters— 24 — (24)— (33)0.5 (0.09)Tax matters— — — — (30)121 (5.7)0.32 Adjusted$9,807 $4,984 $915 $3,908 $(181)$3,139 15.8 %$8.26 FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY202120202019Net cash provided by operating activities$3,263 $3,277 $2,191 Net cash used in investing activities(859)(4,701)(1,455)Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities(2,365)(11)3 Effect of exchange rate changes(38)41 (18)Change in cash and cash equivalents$1 $(1,394)$721 We believe our financial condition continues to be of high quality, as evidenced by our ability to generate substantial cash from operations and to readily access capital markets at competitive rates despite the COVID-19 pandemic. Operating cash flow provides the primary source of cash to fund operating needs and capital expenditures. Excess operating cash is used first to fund acquisitions to complement our portfolio of businesses. Other discretionary uses include dividends and share repurchases. We supplement operating cash flow with debt to fund our activities as necessary. Our overall cash position reflects our business results and a global cash management strategy that takes into account liquidity management, economic factors and tax considerations.Operating ActivitiesCash provided by operating activities was $3,263, $3,277 and $2,191 in 2021, 2020 and 2019. The slight decrease from 2020 was primarily due to higher accounts receivable, partially offset by increased net earnings and accounts payable. Investing ActivitiesCash used in investing activities was $859, $4,701 and $1,455 in 2021, 2020 and 2019. The decrease in cash used in 2021 was primarily due to decreased payments for acquisitions and certain other businesses and related assets. In 2020 we acquired Wright, while in 2019 we acquired Mobius Imaging and Cardan Robotics and certain other businesses and related assets.Financing ActivitiesCash provided by (used in) financing activities was ($2,365), ($11) and $3 in 2021, 2020 and 2019. The increase in cash used in financing activities was primarily driven by long-term debt repayments of $1,151 and dividend payments of $950 in 2021. In 2020 we secured a $400 term loan in November, issued $600 of notes in November and $2,300 of notes in June, which was offset by total debt repayments of $2,297 and dividend payments of $863. There were no share repurchases in 2021 or 2020.We maintain debt levels that we consider appropriate after evaluating a number of factors including cash requirements for ongoing operations, investment and financing plans (including acquisitions and share repurchase activities) and overall cost of capital.

We anticipate being able to support our short-term liquidity and operating needs from a variety of sources including cash from operations, commercial paper and existing credit lines. In October 2021 we entered into a new revolving credit agreement that replaces our previous agreement dated August 19, 2016. The primary changes were to increase the aggregate principal amount of the facility by $750 to $2,250, extend the maturity date to October 26, 2026, increase the leverage ratio to 3.75 and provide LIBOR replacement language.We raised funds in the capital markets in 2020 and 2019 and may continue to do so from time-to-time. We continue to have strong investment-grade short-term and long-term debt ratings that we believe should enable us to refinance our debt as needed.Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held in locations outside the United States was approximately 26% and 30% on December 31, 2021 and 2020. We intend to use this cash to expand operations organically and through acquisitions.Guarantees and Other Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsWe do not have guarantees or other off-balance sheet financing arrangements, including variable interest entities, of a magnitude that we believe could have a material impact on our financial condition or liquidity.CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND FORWARD-LOOKING CASH REQUIREMENTSAs further described in Note 7 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, in 2021 we recorded charges to earnings related to the Rejuvenate and ABG II and LFIT Anatomic CoCr V40 Femoral Heads recall matters and recorded product liabilities relating to Wright legacy hip products claims. Recorded reserves represent the minimum of the range of probable cost remaining to resolve these matters. The final outcome of these matters is dependent on many variables that are difficult to predict. The ultimate cost to entirely resolve these matters may be materially different from the amount of the current estimates and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. We are not able to reasonably estimate the future periods in which payments will be made.As further described in Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, on December 31, 2021 we had a reserve for Dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.17STRYKER CORPORATION 2021 FORM 10-Kuncertain income tax positions of $444. Due to uncertainties regarding the ultimate resolution of income tax audits, we are not able to reasonably estimate the future periods in which any income tax payments to settle these uncertain income tax positions will be made.As further described in Note 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, on December 31, 2021 our defined benefit pension plans were underfunded by $493, of which approximately $491 related to plans outside the United States. Due to the rules affecting tax-deductible contributions in the jurisdictions in which the plans are offered and the impact of future plan asset performance, changes in interest rates and potential changes in legislation in the United States and other foreign jurisdictions, we are not able to reasonably estimate the amounts that may be required to fund defined benefit pension plans.

We believe these accounting policies and the others set forth in Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements are critical to understanding our results of operations and financial condition. Actual results could differ from our estimates and assumptions, and any such differences could be material to our results of operations and financial condition. Inventory ReservesWe maintain reserves for excess and obsolete inventory resulting from the potential inability to sell certain products at prices in excess of current carrying costs. We make estimates regarding the future recoverability of the costs of these products and record provisions based on historical experience, expiration of sterilization dates and expected future trends. If actual product life cycles, product demand or acceptance of new product introductions are less favorable than projected by management, additional inventory write downs may be required, which could unfavorably affect future operating results.Income TaxesOur annual tax rate is determined based on our income, statutory tax rates and the tax impacts of items treated differently for tax purposes than for financial reporting purposes. Tax law requires certain items be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return, and some differences are temporary and reverse over time, such as depreciation expense. These temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities.Deferred tax assets generally represent the tax effect of items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in our income statement. Deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in our financial statements for which payment was deferred, the tax effect of expenditures for which a deduction was taken in our tax return but has not yet been recognized in our financial statements or assets recorded at fair value in business combinations for which there was no corresponding tax basis adjustment.Inherent in determining our annual tax rate are judgments regarding business plans, tax planning opportunities and expectations about future outcomes. Realization of certain deferred tax assets is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction prior to the expiration of the carryforward periods. Although realization is not assured, management believes it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances, will be realized.We operate in multiple jurisdictions with complex tax policy and regulatory environments. In certain of these jurisdictions, we may take tax positions that management believes are supportable but are potentially subject to successful challenge by the applicable taxing authority. These differences of interpretation with the respective governmental taxing authorities can be impacted by the local economic and fiscal environment. We evaluate our tax positions and establish liabilities in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance on uncertainty in income taxes. We review these tax uncertainties in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of tax audits, and adjust them accordingly. We have a number of audits in process in various jurisdictions. Although the resolution of these tax positions is uncertain, based on currently available information, we believe that it is more likely than not that the ultimate outcomes will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.Due to the number of estimates and assumptions inherent in calculating the various components of our tax provision, certain changes or future events, such as changes in tax legislation, geographic mix of earnings, completion of tax audits or earnings repatriation plans, could have an impact on those estimates and our effective tax rate.Acquisitions, Goodwill and Intangibles, and Long-Lived AssetsOur financial statements include the operations of an acquired business starting from the completion of the acquisition. In addition, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded on the date of acquisition at their respective estimated fair values, with any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired recorded as goodwill. Significant judgment is required in estimating the fair value of intangible assets and in assigning their respective useful lives. Accordingly, we typically obtain the assistance of third-party valuation specialists for significant items. The fair value estimates are based on available historical information and on future expectations and assumptions deemed reasonable by management but are inherently uncertain. We typically use an income method to estimate the fair value of intangible assets, which is based on forecasts of the expected future cash flows attributable to the respective assets. Significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the valuations reflect a consideration of other marketplace participants and include the amount and timing of future cash flows (including expected growth rates and profitability), the underlying product or technology life cycles, the economic barriers to entry and the discount rate applied to the cash flows. Unanticipated market or macroeconomic events and circumstances may occur that could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and assumptions. Determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment. With the exception of certain trade names, the majority of our acquired intangible assets (e.g., certain trademarks or Dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.18STRYKER CORPORATION 2021 FORM 10-Kbrands, customer and distributor relationships, patents and technologies) are expected to have determinable useful lives. Our assessment as to the useful lives of these intangible assets is based on a number of factors including competitive environment, market share, trademark, brand history, underlying product life cycles, operating plans and the macroeconomic environment of the countries in which the trademarked or branded products are sold. Our estimates of the useful lives of determinable-lived intangibles are primarily based on these same factors. Determinable-lived intangible assets are amortized to expense over their estimated useful life. In some of our acquisitions, we acquire in-process research and development (IPRD) intangible assets. For acquisitions accounted for as business combinations, IPRD is considered to be an indefinite-lived intangible asset until the research is completed (then it becomes a determinable-lived intangible asset) or determined to have no future use (then it is impaired). For asset acquisitions, IPRD is expensed immediately unless there is an alternative future use.The value of indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill is not amortized but is tested at least annually for impairment. Our impairment testing for goodwill is performed separately from our impairment testing of indefinite-lived intangibles. We perform our annual impairment test for goodwill in the fourth quarter of each year. We consider qualitative indicators of the fair value of a reporting unit when it is unlikely that a reporting unit has impaired goodwill and periodically corroborate that assessment with quantitative information. In certain circumstances, we also use a discounted cash flow analysis that requires certain assumptions and estimates be made regarding market conditions and our future profitability. In those circumstances we test goodwill for impairment by reviewing the carrying value compared to the fair value at the reporting unit level. We test individual indefinite-lived intangibles by reviewing the individual carrying values compared to the fair value. We determine the fair value of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets based on the income approach. Under the income approach, we calculate the fair value of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. Considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating and macroeconomic changes and to estimate future cash flows to measure fair value. Assumptions used in our impairment evaluations, such as forecasted growth rates and cost of capital, are consistent with internal projections and operating plans. We believe such assumptions and estimates are also comparable to those that would be used by other marketplace participants. Our annual impairment testing indicated that all reporting unit goodwill fair values significantly exceeded their respective recorded values. Future changes in the judgments, assumptions and estimates that are used in our impairment testing for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, including discount and tax rates and future cash flow projections, could result in significantly different estimates of the fair values. A significant reduction in the estimated fair values could result in impairment charges that could materially affect our results of operations.We review our other long-lived assets for indicators of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The evaluation is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, which is at the individual asset level or the asset group level. The undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the related assets are estimated over their useful life based on updated projections. If the evaluation indicates that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable, any potential impairment is measured based upon the fair value of the related assets or asset group as determined by an appropriate market appraisal or other valuation technique. Assets classified as held for sale, if any, are recorded at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell. Legal and Other ContingenciesWe are involved in various ongoing proceedings, legal actions and claims arising in the normal course of business, including proceedings related to product, labor and intellectual property, and other matters that are more fully described in Note 7 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. The outcomes of these matters will generally not be known for prolonged periods of time. In certain of the legal proceedings, the claimants seek damages, as well as other compensatory and equitable relief, that could result in the payment of significant claims and settlements and/or the imposition of injunctions or other equitable relief. For legal matters for which management had sufficient information to reasonably estimate our future obligations, a liability representing management's best estimate of the probable loss, or the minimum of the range of probable losses when a best estimate within the range is not known, for the resolution of these legal matters is recorded. The estimates are based on consultation with legal counsel, previous settlement experience and settlement strategies. If actual outcomes are less favorable than those projected by management, additional expense may be incurred, which could unfavorably affect future operating results. We are currently self-insured for certain claims and expenses. The ultimate cost to us with respect to product liability claims could be materially different than the amount of the current estimates and accruals and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTSRefer to Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.ITEM 7A.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.We sell our products globally and, as a result, our financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as market risk exposure from weak economic conditions, exchange rate risk and the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations and financial results. Our operating results are primarily exposed to changes in exchange rates among the United States Dollar, Australian Dollar, British Pound, Canadian Dollar, Chinese Yuan, Euro and Japanese Yen. We develop and manufacture products in the United States, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Ireland, Mexico, Puerto Rico, Switzerland and Turkey and incur costs in the applicable local currencies. This global deployment of facilities serves to partially mitigate the impact of currency exchange rate changes on our cost of sales. Refer to Notes 1, 4 and 5 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding our use of derivative instruments to mitigate these risks. A hypothetical 10% change in foreign currencies relative to the United States Dollar would change the December 31, 2021 fair value of these instruments by approximately $514. We are not able to quantify the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our financial results. Qualitative disclosures about the COVID-19 pandemic are included in Part II, Item 7 ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations"" and Part I, Item 1A ""Risk Factors"" of this Form 10-K.Dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.19STRYKER CORPORATION 2021 FORM 10-K",2023-12-30 18:43:03.132768
310764,SYK,STRYKER CORP,2023,"ITEM 7.MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.About StrykerStryker is one of the world's leading medical technology companies and, together with our customers, we are driven to make healthcare better. We offer innovative products and services in Medical and Surgical, Neurotechnology, Orthopaedics and Spine that help improve patient and healthcare outcomes. Alongside our customers around the world, Stryker impacts more than 130 million patients annually. Our goal is to achieve sales growth at the high-end of the medical technology (MedTech) industry and maintain our long-term capital allocation strategy that prioritizes: (1) Acquisitions, (2) Dividends and (3) Share repurchases.Macroeconomic EnvironmentThe global economy is experiencing increased inflationary pressures in part due to global supply chain disruptions, labor shortages and other impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and current macroeconomic environment which we anticipate will continue. Higher interest rates and capital costs, higher shipping costs, increased costs of labor and weakening foreign currency exchange rates are creating additional economic challenges. These conditions may cause our customers to decrease or delay orders for our products and services, and we expect the higher interest rates to impact demand for our capital products.Our operations have been adversely impacted by the inflationary pressures primarily related to labor, steel and transportation costs as well as the impact of purchasing electronic components at premium prices on the spot market. Sales growth in certain products has been constrained by the continuing supply chain challenges and electronic component shortages, especially impacting the capital products in our MedSurg businesses, although the supply chain constraints eased somewhat in the fourth quarter. Russia and Ukraine ConflictThe military conflict in Russia and Ukraine and the sanctions imposed by the United States government and other nations in response to this conflict have caused significant volatility and disruptions to the global markets. Given that we provide life-saving and life-enhancing products, we plan to continue operating in Russia provided we can safely do so. In 2022 net sales in Russia were approximately 0.3% of our revenues. Although Russia does not constitute a material portion of our business, there is uncertainty around the impact it will have on the global economy, supply chains and fuel and energy prices generally, and therefore our business.China Volume-Based Procurement and Import Purchase EvaluationThe government in China has launched regional and national programs for volume-based procurement (VBP) of high-value medical consumables to reduce healthcare costs. Each VBP program has specific requirements to award contracts to the lowest bidders who are able to satisfy the quality and quantity requirements. The successful bidders may be guaranteed sales volume for certain products, while unsuccessful bidders may lose unit sales volume. We have been a winning bidder in certain national and regional VBP programs, including those for joint replacement and trauma products in 2021 and certain neurovascular products in the fourth quarter of 2022. The prices required for a successful bid have negatively impacted the commercial operations of joint replacement, trauma and certain neurovascular products in China.We were unsuccessful in our bids in the VBP program for spine products that took place in the third quarter of 2022 and as a result we are exiting the spine business in China. To date our other businesses have not been significantly impacted, but may be in the future as a result of additional VBP programs. China has also issued national guiding standards for Import Purchase Evaluation (IPE) which has increased the purchase of locally sourced equipment in China's public hospitals and is impacting our MedSurg business in China. Our business in China represented approximately 2.4% our revenues in 2022.Overview of 2022In 2022 we achieved reported net sales growth of 7.8%. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, sales grew 9.7% in constant currency. We reported net earnings of $2,358 and net earnings per diluted share of $6.17. Excluding the impact of certain items, we achieved adjusted net earnings(1) of $3,571 and adjusted net earnings per diluted share(1) of $9.34 representing growth of 2.8%. We continued our capital allocation strategy by investing $2,563 in acquisitions and paying $1,051 in dividends to our shareholders. In February 2022 we entered into a $1.5 billion term loan agreement that matures on February 22, 2025 and bears interest at a base rate based on the Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) plus 0.725%. In 2022 we repaid $650 of this term loan. Refer to Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.In February 2022 we completed the acquisition of Vocera for $79.25 per share, or an aggregate purchase price of $2.6 billion, net of cash acquired ($3.0 billion including convertible notes). Vocera is a leader in the digital care coordination and communication category. Vocera is part of our Medical business within MedSurg and Neurotechnology. Goodwill attributable to the acquisition reflects the strategic benefits of expanding our presence in adjacent markets, diversifying our product portfolio, advancing innovations, and accelerating our digital aspirations. Refer to Note 6 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.In 2022 we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $216 related to our Spine business. Refer to Note 8 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.On August 16, 2022 the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) was enacted into law. The IRA includes a 15% corporate alternative minimum tax effective in 2023 and a 1% tax on share repurchases after December 31, 2022. We do not expect the tax-related provisions of the IRA to have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. The impact of the excise tax on share repurchases will be dependent on the extent of share repurchases made in future periods.(1) Refer to ""Non-GAAP Financial Measures"" for a discussion of non-GAAP financial measures used in this report and a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.Dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.12STRYKER CORPORATION 2022 FORM 10-KCONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONSPercent Net SalesPercentage Change2022202120202022202120202022 vs. 20212021 vs. 2020Net sales$18,449 $17,108 $14,351 100.0 %100.0 %100.0 %7.8 %19.2 %Gross profit11,578 10,968 9,057 62.8 64.1 63.1 5.6 21.1 Research, development and engineering expenses1,454 1,235 984 7.9 7.2 6.9 17.7 25.5 Selling, general and administrative expenses6,455 6,427 5,361 35.0 37.6 37.4 0.4 19.9 Recall charges, net(15)103 17 (0.1)0.6 0.1 nmnmAmortization of intangible assets627 619 472 3.4 3.6 3.3 1.3 31.1 Goodwill impairment216 — — 1.2 — — nmnmOther income (expense), net(158)(303)(269)(0.9)(1.8)(1.9)(47.9)12.6 Income taxes325 287 355 nmnmnm13.2(19.2)Net earnings$2,358 $1,994 $1,599 12.8 %11.7 %11.1 %18.3 %24.7 %Net earnings per diluted share$6.17 $5.21 $4.20 18.4 %24.0 %Adjusted net earnings per diluted share(1)$9.34 $9.09 $7.43 2.8 %22.3 %Geographic and Segment Net SalesPercentage Change2022 vs. 20212021 vs. 2020202220212020As ReportedConstantCurrencyAs ReportedConstantCurrencyGeographic:United States$13,638 $12,321 $10,455 10.7 %10.7 %17.9 %17.9 %International4,811 4,787 3,896 0.5 11.7 22.8 18.8 Total$18,449 $17,108 $14,351 7.8 %11.0 %19.2 %18.1 %Segment:MedSurg and Neurotechnology$10,611 $9,538 $8,345 11.2 %14.1 %14.3 %13.3 %Orthopaedics and Spine7,838 7,570 6,006 3.5 7.0 26.0 24.8 Total$18,449 $17,108 $14,351 7.8 %11.0 %19.2 %18.1 %Supplemental Net Sales Growth InformationPercentage Change2022 vs. 20212021 vs. 2020United StatesInternationalUnited StatesInternational202220212020As ReportedConstant CurrencyAs ReportedAs ReportedConstant CurrencyAs ReportedConstant CurrencyAs ReportedAs ReportedConstant CurrencyMedSurg and Neurotechnology:Instruments$2,279 $2,111 $1,863 8.0 %10.4 %10.6 %(0.9)%10.0 %13.4 %12.5 %11.3 %20.9 %16.6 %Endoscopy2,423 2,141 1,763 13.2 15.9 14.6 8.2 20.8 21.5 20.8 18.6 32.7 29.4 Medical3,031 2,607 2,524 16.2 18.6 20.6 1.5 11.7 3.3 2.2 5.1 (2.4)(6.6)Neurovascular1,200 1,188 973 1.1 7.2 (0.9)2.3 12.2 22.0 19.5 18.3 24.4 20.3 Neuro Cranial1,376 1,214 972 13.3 15.4 14.9 6.1 17.5 24.9 24.3 23.4 32.4 28.6 Other302 277 250 9.2 9.3 8.9 25.3 29.9 10.4 10.3 10.0 48.9 40.8 $10,611 $9,538 $8,345 11.2 %14.1 %14.2 %3.0 %13.8 %14.3 %13.3 %13.0 %18.1 %14.0 %Orthopaedics and Spine:Knees$1,997 $1,848 $1,567 8.0 %11.2 %10.6 %1.0 %12.9 %18.0 %16.9 %15.4 %25.5 %21.3 %Hips1,413 1,342 1,206 5.3 10.1 9.1 (0.6)11.5 11.2 9.9 5.8 21.1 17.2 Trauma and Extremities2,807 2,664 1,722 5.4 8.7 9.0 (3.2)8.0 54.6 53.0 63.8 36.8 32.3 Spine1,146 1,167 1,047 (1.8)1.1 0.6 (7.7)2.4 11.5 10.5 8.7 19.1 15.2 Other475 549 464 (13.3)(10.3)(16.9)(0.9)12.8 18.2 18.0 10.1 58.8 57.4 $7,838 $7,570 $6,006 3.5 %7.0 %6.0 %(2.2)%9.3 %26.0 %24.8 %25.0 %28.6 %24.5 %Total$18,449 $17,108 $14,351 7.8 %11.0 %10.7 %0.5 %11.7 %19.2 %18.1 %17.9 %22.8 %18.8 %nm - not meaningfulConsolidated Net SalesConsolidated net sales increased 7.8% as reported and 11.0% in constant currency, as foreign currency exchange rates negatively impacted net sales by 3.2%.

The decrease in net expense in 2022 was primarily due to favorable investment returns and the reversal of accrued interest of $50 related to the effective settlement of the United States federal income tax audit for years 2014 through 2018. Refer to Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. The increase in net expense in 2021 compared to 2020 was primarily due to increased interest expense driven by the additional debt from the bond offerings completed in June 2020 and November 2020 related to the Wright acquisition.Income TaxesOur effective tax rate was 12.1%, 12.6% and 18.2% for 2022, 2021 and 2020. The effective income tax rate for 2022 decreased due to the effective settlement of the United States federal income tax audit for years 2014 through 2018 of $162 and the reversal of deferred income tax on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries. In addition, the effective income tax rates for 2022, 2021 and 2020 reflect the continued lower effective income tax rates as a result of our European operations, the tax effect related to the transfers of intellectual property between tax jurisdictions, the tax effect of future remittances of the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries and certain discrete tax items.

We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful information to assist investors and shareholders in understanding our financial results and assessing our prospects for future performance. Management believes percentage sales growth in constant currency and the other adjusted measures described above are important indicators of our operations because they exclude items that may not be indicative of or are unrelated to our core operating results and provide a baseline for analyzing trends in our underlying businesses. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures for reviewing the operating results of reportable business segments and analyzing potential future business trends in connection with our budget process and bases certain management incentive compensation on these non-GAAP financial measures. To measure percentage sales growth in constant currency, we remove the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates that affect the comparability and trend of sales. Percentage sales growth in constant currency is calculated by translating current and prior year results at the same foreign currency exchange rate. To measure percentage organic sales growth, we remove the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, acquisitions and divestitures, which affect the comparability and trend of sales. Percentage organic sales growth is calculated by translating current year and prior year results at the same foreign currency exchange rates excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures. To measure earnings performance on a consistent and comparable basis, we exclude certain items that affect the comparability of operating results and the trend of earnings. To measure free cash flow, we adjust cash provided by operating activities by the amount of purchases of property, plant and equipment and proceeds from long-lived asset disposals and remove the impact of certain legal settlements and recall payments. To measure free cash flow Dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.15STRYKER CORPORATION 2022 FORM 10-Kconversion we divide free cash flow by adjusted net earnings. These adjustments are irregular in timing and may not be indicative of our past and future performance. The following are examples of the types of adjustments that may be included in a period:1.Acquisition and integration-related costs. Costs related to integrating recently acquired businesses (e.g., costs associated with the termination of sales relationships, workforce reductions and other integration-related activities), changes in the fair value of contingent consideration and specific costs (e.g., inventory step-up and deal costs) related to the consummation of the acquisition process.2.Amortization of purchased intangible assets. Periodic amortization expense related to purchased intangible assets. 3.Restructuring-related and other charges. Costs associated with the termination of sales relationships in certain countries, workforce reductions, elimination of product lines, certain long-lived and intangible asset write-offs and impairments and associated costs and other restructuring-related activities.4.Goodwill impairment. Charges to impair the carrying value of goodwill.5.Medical device regulations. Costs specific to updating our quality system, product labeling, asset write-offs and product remanufacturing to comply with the new medical device reporting regulations and other requirements of the European Union.6.Recall-related matters.

Operating cash flow provides the primary source of cash to fund operating needs and capital expenditures. Excess operating cash is used first to fund acquisitions to complement our portfolio of businesses. Other discretionary uses include dividends and share repurchases. We supplement operating cash flow with debt to fund our activities as necessary. Our overall cash position reflects our business results and a global cash management strategy that takes into account liquidity management, economic factors and tax considerations.Operating ActivitiesCash provided by operating activities was $2,624, $3,263 and $3,277 in 2022, 2021 and 2020. The decrease from 2021 was primarily due to higher costs for certain electronic components and pre-buying of critical raw materials to manage supply chain delays as well as higher accounts receivable as a result of sales occurring near the end of the year, partially offset by increased net earnings. Investing ActivitiesCash used in investing activities was $2,924, $859 and $4,701 in 2022, 2021 and 2020. The increase in cash used in 2022 was primarily due to the acquisition of Vocera and investments in capital projects, partially offset by settlements of certain foreign currency forward contracts designated as net investment hedges.Financing ActivitiesCash provided by (used in) financing activities was ($749), ($2,365) and ($11) in 2022, 2021 and 2020. Cash used in 2022 was primarily driven by dividend payments of $1,051 and repayments of debt, including $650 of payments on the $1,500 term loan used to fund the acquisition of Vocera. In 2021 we made payments of $1,151 on long-term debt and dividend payments of $950. In 2020 we secured a $400 term loan in November, and issued $600 of notes in November and $2,300 of notes in June, which was offset by total debt repayments of $2,297 and dividend payments of $863. There were no share repurchases in 2022, 2021 or 2020.We maintain debt levels that we consider appropriate after evaluating a number of factors including cash requirements for ongoing operations, investment and financing plans (including acquisitions and share repurchase activities) and overall cost of capital. Refer to Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.202220212020Dividends paid per common share$2.78 $2.52 $2.30 Total dividends paid to common shareholders$1,051 $950 $863 LiquidityCash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $1,928 and $3,019, and our current assets exceeded current liabilities by $3,972 and $5,468 on December 31, 2022 and 2021. We anticipate being able to support our short-term liquidity and operating needs from a variety of sources including cash from operations, commercial paper and existing credit lines. In October 2021 we entered into a new revolving credit agreement that replaces our previous agreement dated August 19, 2016. The primary changes were to increase the aggregate principal amount of the facility by $750 to $2,250, extend the maturity date to October 26, 2026, increase the leverage ratio to 3.75 and provide LIBOR replacement language.We raised funds in the capital markets in the past and may continue to do so from time-to-time. We continue to have strong investment-grade short-term and long-term debt ratings that we believe should enable us to refinance our debt as needed.Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held in locations outside the United States was approximately 36% and 26% on December 31, 2022 and 2021.Guarantees and Other Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsWe do not have guarantees or other off-balance sheet financing arrangements, including variable interest entities, of a magnitude that we believe could have a material impact on our financial condition or liquidity.CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND FORWARD-LOOKING CASH REQUIREMENTSIn 2022 we recorded a net benefit for recall matters related to adjusting existing reserves to reflect our best estimate of our remaining obligation for LFIT Anatomic CoCr V40 Femoral Heads recall matters partially offset by charges primarily related to Wright hip products recall matters. As further described in Note 7 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, our recorded product liabilities include Wright hip products, Rejuvenate and ABG II and LFIT Anatomic CoCr V40 Femoral Heads recall matters. Recorded reserves represent the minimum of the range of probable cost remaining to resolve these matters. The final outcome of these matters is dependent on many variables that Dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.17STRYKER CORPORATION 2022 FORM 10-Kare difficult to predict. The ultimate cost to entirely resolve these matters may be materially different from the amount of the current estimates and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. We are not able to reasonably estimate the future periods in which payments will be made.As further described in Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, on December 31, 2022 we had a reserve for uncertain income tax positions of $286. Due to uncertainties regarding the ultimate resolution of income tax audits, we are not able to reasonably estimate the future periods in which any income tax payments to settle these uncertain income tax positions will be made.As further described in Note 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, on December 31, 2022 our defined benefit pension plans were underfunded by $253, of which approximately $250 related to plans outside the United States. Due to the rules affecting tax-deductible contributions in the jurisdictions in which the plans are offered and the impact of future plan asset performance, changes in interest rates and potential changes in legislation in the United States and other foreign jurisdictions, we are not able to reasonably estimate the amounts that may be required to fund defined benefit pension plans.

We believe these accounting policies and the others set forth in Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements are critical to understanding our results of operations and financial condition. Actual results could differ from our estimates and assumptions, and any such differences could be material to our results of operations and financial condition. Inventory ReservesWe maintain reserves for excess and obsolete inventory resulting from the potential inability to sell certain products at prices in excess of current carrying costs. We make estimates regarding the future recoverability of the costs of these products and record provisions based on historical experience, expiration of sterilization dates and expected future trends. If actual product life cycles, product demand or acceptance of new product introductions are less favorable than projected by management, additional inventory write downs may be required, which could unfavorably affect future operating results.Income TaxesOur annual tax rate is determined based on our income, statutory tax rates and the tax impacts of items treated differently for tax purposes than for financial reporting purposes. Tax law requires certain items be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return, and some differences are temporary and reverse over time, such as depreciation expense. These temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities.Deferred tax assets generally represent the tax effect of items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in our income statement. Deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in our financial statements for which payment was deferred, the tax effect of expenditures for which a deduction was taken in our tax return but has not yet been recognized in our financial statements or assets recorded at fair value in business combinations for which there was no corresponding tax basis adjustment.Inherent in determining our annual tax rate are judgments regarding business plans, tax planning opportunities and expectations about future outcomes. Realization of certain deferred tax assets is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction prior to the expiration of the carryforward periods. Although realization is not assured, management believes it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances, will be realized.We operate in multiple jurisdictions with complex tax policy and regulatory environments. In certain of these jurisdictions, we may take tax positions that management believes are supportable but are potentially subject to successful challenge by the applicable taxing authority. These differences of interpretation with the respective governmental taxing authorities can be impacted by the local economic and fiscal environment. We evaluate our tax positions and establish liabilities in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance on uncertainty in income taxes. We review these tax uncertainties in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of tax audits, and adjust them accordingly. We have a number of audits in process in various jurisdictions. Although the resolution of these tax positions is uncertain, based on currently available information, we believe that it is more likely than not that the ultimate outcomes will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.Due to the number of estimates and assumptions inherent in calculating the various components of our tax provision, certain changes or future events, such as changes in tax legislation, geographic mix of earnings, completion of tax audits or earnings repatriation plans, could have an impact on those estimates and our effective tax rate.Acquisitions, Goodwill and Intangibles, and Long-Lived AssetsOur financial statements include the operations of an acquired business starting from the completion of the acquisition. In addition, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded on the date of acquisition at their respective estimated fair values, with any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired recorded as goodwill. Significant judgment is required in estimating the fair value of intangible assets and in assigning their respective useful lives. Accordingly, we typically obtain the assistance of third-party valuation specialists for significant items. The fair value estimates are based on available historical information and on future expectations and assumptions deemed reasonable by management but are inherently uncertain. We typically use an income method to estimate the fair value of intangible assets, which is based on forecasts of the expected future cash flows attributable to the respective assets. Significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the valuations reflect a consideration of other marketplace participants and include the amount and timing Dollar amounts in millions except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.18STRYKER CORPORATION 2022 FORM 10-Kof future cash flows (including expected growth rates and profitability), the underlying product or technology life cycles, the economic barriers to entry and the discount rate applied to the cash flows. Unanticipated market or macroeconomic events and circumstances may occur that could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and assumptions. Determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment. With the exception of certain trade names, the majority of our acquired intangible assets (e.g., certain trademarks or brands, customer and distributor relationships, patents and technologies) are expected to have determinable useful lives. Our assessment as to the useful lives of these intangible assets is based on a number of factors including competitive environment, market share, trademark, brand history, underlying product life cycles, operating plans and the macroeconomic environment of the countries in which the trademarked or branded products are sold. Our estimates of the useful lives of determinable-lived intangibles are primarily based on these same factors. Determinable-lived intangible assets are amortized to expense over their estimated useful life. In some of our acquisitions, we acquire in-process research and development (IPRD) intangible assets. For acquisitions accounted for as business combinations, IPRD is considered to be an indefinite-lived intangible asset until the research is completed (then it becomes a determinable-lived intangible asset) or determined to have no future use (then it is impaired). For asset acquisitions, IPRD is expensed immediately unless there is an alternative future use.Indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized but are tested annually for impairment or whenever events or circumstances indicate such assets may be impaired. We perform our annual impairment test for goodwill as of October 31 each year. For indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill, we perform a qualitative assessment when it is unlikely that an asset or reporting unit is impaired. For our goodwill impairment test, we periodically corroborate our qualitative assessment with quantitative information. When necessary, we determine the fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets and reporting units using an income approach. The income approach calculates the present value of estimated future cash flows and requires certain assumptions and estimates be made regarding market conditions and our future profitability. Considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating and macroeconomic changes and to estimate future cash flows used to measure fair value. Assumptions used in our impairment evaluations, such as forecasted growth rates and cost of capital, are consistent with internal business plans. We believe such assumptions and estimates are also comparable to those that would be used by other marketplace participants. In the fourth quarter of 2022 we determined that our Spine reporting unit’s carrying value was in excess of its estimated fair value and recognized an impairment charge of $216. The fair value of the Spine reporting unit was determined using a discounted cash flow analysis, which is a form of the income approach. Significant inputs to the analysis included assumptions for future revenue growth, operating margin and the weighted average cost of capital. A hypothetical 1% increase in our estimate of the rate used to discount the estimated future cash flows to their present value would result in an additional impairment charge of $220. Refer to Note 8 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion and the factors that contributed to these impairment charges.For our other reporting units, we considered qualitative indicators of impairment as it was considered more likely than not that the fair values of those reporting units exceeded their respective carrying values. No impairment was identified for those reporting units in 2022. Future changes in the judgments, assumptions and estimates that are used in our impairment testing for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, including discount and tax rates and future cash flow projections, could result in significantly different estimates of the fair values. A significant reduction in the estimated fair values could result in impairment charges that could materially affect our results of operations.We review our other long-lived assets for indicators of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The evaluation is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, which is at the individual asset level or the asset group level. The undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the related assets are estimated over their useful life based on updated projections. If the evaluation indicates that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable, any potential impairment is measured based upon the fair value of the related assets or asset group as determined by an appropriate market appraisal or other valuation technique. Assets classified as held for sale, if any, are recorded at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell. Legal and Other ContingenciesWe are involved in various ongoing proceedings, legal actions and claims arising in the normal course of business, including proceedings related to product, labor and intellectual property, and other matters that are more fully described in Note 7 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. The outcomes of these matters will generally not be known for prolonged periods of time. In certain of the legal proceedings, the claimants seek damages, as well as other compensatory and equitable relief, that could result in the payment of significant claims and settlements and/or the imposition of injunctions or other equitable relief. For legal matters for which management had sufficient information to reasonably estimate our future obligations, a liability representing management's best estimate of the probable loss, or the minimum of the range of probable losses when a best estimate within the range is not known, for the resolution of these legal matters is recorded. The estimates are based on consultation with legal counsel, previous settlement experience and settlement strategies. If actual outcomes are less favorable than those projected by management, additional expense may be incurred, which could unfavorably affect future operating results. We are currently self-insured for certain claims and expenses. The ultimate cost to us with respect to product liability claims could be materially different than the amount of the current estimates and accruals and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTSRefer to Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.ITEM 7A.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.We sell our products globally and, as a result, our operations and financial results could be significantly affected by market risk exposure from exchange rate risk.

Throughout this discussion, references are made to the following financial measures: “constant currency,” “adjusted net earnings,” “adjusted basic net earnings per share,” “adjusted diluted net earnings per share,” “adjusted net earnings from continuing operations,” “adjusted basic net earnings per share from continuing operations” and “adjusted diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations.” These financial measures are an alternative representation of Stryker Corporation’s (the Company or Stryker) past and potential future operational performance and do not replace the presentation of the Company’s reported financial results under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The Company has provided these supplemental non-GAAP financial measures because they provide meaningful information regarding the Company’s results on a consistent and comparable basis for the periods presented. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures for reviewing the operating results of its business segments, for analyzing potential future business trends in connection with its budget process and bases certain annual bonus plans on these non-GAAP financial measures. In order to measure the Company’s sales performance on a constant currency basis, it is necessary to remove the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates which affects the comparability and trend of sales. Constant currency results are calculated by translating current year results at prior year average foreign currency exchange rates. In order to measure earnings performance on a consistent and comparable basis, the Company excludes the patent litigation gain and the income tax expenses associated with the repatriation of foreign earnings recorded in 2009, the restructuring charges recorded in 2009 and 2008, and the intangible asset impairment charge recorded in 2007, each of which affects the comparability of operating results and the trend of earnings. Additional details regarding the nature, determination and financial statement impact of these items are included in Results of Operations. In addition, the Company believes investors will utilize this information to evaluate period-to-period results on a comparable basis and to better understand potential future operating results. The Company encourages investors and other users of these financial statements to review its Consolidated Financial Statements and other publicly filed reports in their entirety and not to rely solely on any single financial measure. Executive Level Overview Stryker is one of the world’s leading medical technology companies with the most broadly based range of products in orthopaedics and a significant presence in other medical specialties. Stryker works with respected medical professionals to help people lead more active and more satisfying lives. The Company’s products include implants used in joint replacement, trauma and spinal surgeries; surgical equipment and surgical navigation systems; endoscopic and communications systems; patient handling and emergency medical equipment as well as other medical device products used in a variety of medical specialties. 20 Table of Contents Domestic sales accounted for 64% of total revenues in 2009. Most of the Company’s products are marketed directly to doctors, hospitals and other healthcare facilities by approximately 4,100 sales and marketing personnel in the United States. Stryker primarily maintains separate and dedicated sales forces for each of its principal product lines to provide focus and a high level of expertise to each medical specialty served. International sales accounted for 36% of total revenues in 2009. The Company’s products are sold in more than 100 countries through Company-owned sales subsidiaries and branches as well as third-party dealers and distributors. The Company’s business is generally not seasonal in nature; however, the number of orthopaedic implant surgeries is lower during the summer months. In the fourth quarter of 2009, the Company acquired Ascent Healthcare Solutions, Inc. (Ascent), the market leader in the reprocessing and remanufacturing of medical devices in the United States, for $525.0 million in an all cash transaction. In addition, the Company settled an outstanding patent infringement lawsuit and received $62.5 million pursuant to a confidential settlement. The Company also repatriated $787.0 million of foreign earnings to the United States which was used in part to fund the acquisition of Ascent. In the third quarter of 2009, the Company decided to terminate certain third-party agreements at the Company’s EMEA Division, to simplify the organization structure at its Biotech, EMEA, Japan and Canada divisions and to discontinue selling certain products within its Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg business segments. Additional details, including the financial statement impact of these transactions, are included in Results of Operations and Liquidity and Capital Resources. In 2009 a federal grand jury in the District of Massachusetts returned an indictment charging Stryker Biotech LLC and certain current and former employees of Stryker Biotech with wire fraud, conspiracy to defraud the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), distribution of a misbranded device and false statements to the FDA. The Company still hopes to be able to reach a fair and just resolution of this matter. Conviction of these charges could result in significant monetary fines and Stryker Biotech’s exclusion from participating in federal and state healthcare programs, which could have a material affect on Stryker Biotech’s business. However, the ultimate resolution of these matters is not reasonably estimatable at this time. The Company understands that certain former Stryker Biotech employees have pled guilty to charges in connection with this matter. In 2009 the FDA Orthopaedic and Rehabilitation Devices Advisory Panel voted not to recommend that the Company receive marketing approval for its OP-1 Putty. The Company is reviewing its strategic alternatives for OP-1, which could be impacted by the ultimate resolution of the indictment. In the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company decided to simplify the structure of its Japanese distribution business and to substantially reduce development efforts associated with the product technologies acquired from Sightline Technologies Ltd. (Sightline) in 2006. Unanticipated issues arose that delayed the regulatory approval and commercialization efforts of new products associated with the product technologies acquired. Additional details, including the financial statement impact resulting from those decisions, are included in Results of Operations. 21 Table of Contents Results of Operations The table below outlines the components of net earnings from continuing operations from the Consolidated Statements of Earnings as a percentage of net sales and the year-to-year percentage change in dollar amounts: Percentage of Net Sales Percentage Change 2009 2008 2007 2009/2008 2008/2007 Net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 0 % 12 % Cost of sales 32.5 31.7 31.1 2 14 Gross profit 67.5 68.3 68.9 (1 ) 11 Research, development and engineering expenses 5.0 5.5 6.3 (9 ) (2 ) Selling, general and administrative expenses 37.3 39.1 39.9 (5 ) 10 Intangibles amortization 0.5 0.6 0.7 (11 ) (3 ) Restructuring charges 1.0 0.5 — 92 — Intangible asset impairment — — 0.3 — (100 ) Operating income 23.7 22.6 21.8 5 16 Other income (expense) 0.4 0.9 1.0 (52 ) (3 ) Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes 24.2 23.5 22.8 3 15 Income taxes 7.7 6.4 6.4 19 13 Net earnings from continuing operations 16.5 % 17.1 % 16.4 % (4 ) 16 The Company segregates its operations into two reportable business segments: Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment.

Net sales grew by 2% as a result of increased unit volume and changes in product mix partially offset by unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company’s domestic sales were $4,317.4 million for 2009, representing an increase of 1%, as a result of higher shipments of Orthopaedic Implants partially offset by lower shipments of MedSurg Equipment. International sales were $2,405.7 million for 2009, representing a decrease of 1%. The impact of foreign currency comparisons to the dollar value of international sales was unfavorable by $110.1 million for 2009. On a constant currency basis, international sales increased 3% in 2009 as a result of higher shipments of Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment. 23 Table of Contents Worldwide sales of Orthopaedic Implants were $4,119.7 million for 2009, representing an increase of 4%. On a constant currency basis, sales of Orthopaedic Implants increased 6% in 2009 as a result of higher shipments of hips, knees, trauma, craniomaxillofacial and spinal implant systems. Hip Implant Systems: Sales of hip implant systems increased 2% in 2009 (5% on a constant currency basis). In the United States, sales growth was driven by Trident hip products, X3 Polyethylene hip products, Accolade cementless hip products and Restoration Modular Hip System revision hip products. Sales growth in several hip systems, including X3 Polyethylene and Accolade cementless hip products in Europe, Canada and the Latin America and Pacific regions and Trident in Japan, also contributed to the Company’s constant currency sales growth in 2009. Knee Implant Systems: Sales of knee implant systems increased 4% in 2009 (6% on a constant currency basis) due to strong sales growth in the Triathlon Knee System in the United States, Europe, Japan, Canada and the Pacific region and solid sales growth in the Scorpio Knee System in the Latin America region. Trauma Implant Systems: Sales of trauma implant systems increased 5% in 2009 (6% on a constant currency basis) as a result of sales growth in the Gamma 3 Hip Fracture System and the SPS Calcaneal Foot Plating System in the United States, Europe, Canada, Latin America and Pacific regions as well as sales growth in the Company’s VariAx Distal Radius System in Europe, Canada and the Latin America region. Strong sales growth in the HydroSet injectable bone substitute product in the United States, Canada and the Pacific region also contributed to the Company’s constant currency sales growth in 2009. Spinal Implant Systems: Sales of spinal implant systems increased 10% in 2009 (11% on a constant currency basis). The increase was driven by strong worldwide sales growth of thoracolumbar implant systems, interbody devices and cervical implants in the United States, Europe and the Latin America and Pacific regions. Craniomaxillofacial Implant Systems: Sales of craniomaxillofacial (CMF) implant systems increased 8% in 2009 (9% on a constant currency basis) primarily due to strong sales growth of products for neurological indications in the United States, Japan, Canada and the Latin America and Pacific regions. Sales growth of the HydroSet injectable bone substitute products in the United States, Europe Canada and the Pacific region also contributed to the Company’s constant currency sales growth. Worldwide sales of MedSurg Equipment were $2,603.4 million for 2009, representing a decrease of 5%. The general economic slowdown in the United States resulted in a significant and rapid contraction in hospital capital budgets that depressed demand for certain MedSurg Equipment products. The severe weakening of the economy caused the Company’s hospital customers to reduce capital purchases, which generate about 60% of sales within the MedSurg Equipment segment, to a degree not previously experienced in prior recessionary periods. On a constant currency basis, sales of MedSurg Equipment decreased 4% in 2009 as higher shipments of surgical equipment and surgical navigation systems were offset by lower shipments of endoscopic and communication systems as well as patient handling and emergency medical equipment. Surgical Equipment and Surgical Navigation Systems: Sales of surgical equipment and surgical navigation systems increased 1% in 2009 (2% on a constant currency basis) due to worldwide sales growth in operating room equipment as well as sales growth in powered surgical products in the United States, Europe, Japan and the Latin America region and sales growth in interventional pain products in the United States, Japan and the Pacific region. Endoscopic and Communications Systems: Sales of endoscopic and communications systems decreased 2% in 2009 (1% decrease on a constant currency basis) due to lower sales of medical video imaging equipment products and image portal products in the United States partially offset by worldwide sales growth in arthroscopy and general surgery products as well as sales growth in communications products in Japan and the Latin America and Pacific regions and medical video imaging equipment in Europe, Japan and the Latin America and Pacific regions. 24 Table of Contents Patient Handling and Emergency Medical Equipment: Sales of patient handling and emergency medical equipment decreased 22% in 2009 (20% decrease on a constant currency basis) due to lower worldwide sales of hospital bed products and stretchers in the United States, Europe, Canada and the Pacific and Latin America regions, partially offset by sales growth in stretchers in Japan and emergency medical equipment in the United States. Cost of sales represented 32.5% of sales in 2009 compared with 31.7% in 2008. The increase in the cost of sales percentage is primarily due to increased spending for compliance initiatives, higher excess and obsolete inventory costs associated with the Orthopaedic Implants businesses as well as higher unabsorbed costs due to lower production levels. Research, development and engineering expenses represented 5.0% of sales in 2009 compared with 5.5% in 2008. The spending level in 2009 decreased by 9% to $336.2 million due to tight control on discretionary spending as well as the Company’s continued focus of certain research and development resources on compliance initiatives. New product introductions in 2009 for the Orthopaedic Implants segment included the Rejuvenate Modular Primary Hip system; the VariAx elbow plating system and the Xia Uniplanar Titanium Spinal System. Within the MedSurg equipment segment, new product introductions in 2009 included the 1288 HD Camera, the Impression non-powered support surface, the Flyte Suit personal protection system and the RemB micro electric system. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 5% in 2009 and represented 37.3% of sales compared with 39.1% in 2008. In 2009 the Company settled an outstanding patent infringement lawsuit and received $62.5 million pursuant to a confidential settlement agreement. This gain represented a reduction to selling, general and administrative expenses. The remaining decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales in 2009 is due to tight control on discretionary spending that more than offset increased legal settlement costs, net of insurance recoveries, recorded for certain product liability claims. In 2009 the Company recorded $67.0 million ($48.4 million net of income taxes) in restructuring charges related to decisions to terminate certain third-party agent agreements at the Company’s EMEA Division, to simplify the organization structure at its Biotech, EMEA, Japan and Canada divisions and to discontinue selling certain products within its Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment segments. In 2008 the Company recorded $34.9 million ($21.7 million net of income taxes) in restructuring charges related to the decisions to simplify the structure of the Company’s Japanese distribution business and to substantially reduce development efforts associated with Sightline product technologies acquired in 2006. Interest and marketable securities income, which is included in other income (expense), decreased to $53.9 million in 2009 from $97.7 million in 2008 primarily as a result of lower average yields on the Company’s investments. The Company’s effective income tax rate on earnings for the year ended December 31, 2009 was 31.8% compared to an effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2008 of 27.4%. The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2009 reflects the impact of restructuring charges of $48.4 million (net of $18.6 million income tax benefits), the patent litigation gain of $42.9 million (net of $19.6 million income tax expenses) and the impact of the $67.1 million income tax expenses associated with the repatriation of foreign earnings of $787.0 million. The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2008 reflects the impact of the restructuring charges of $21.7 million (net of $13.2 million income tax benefits). In addition to these factors, the Company’s reported effective income tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 are lower than the U.S. statutory income tax rate primarily as a result of manufacturing in lower income tax jurisdictions. Net earnings decreased 4% in 2009 to $1,107.4 million from $1,147.8 million in 2008. Basic net earnings per share decreased 1% in 2009 to $2.79 from $2.81 in 2008, and diluted net earnings per share decreased to $2.77 in 2009 from $2.78 in 2008. 25 Table of Contents Excluding the impact of the patent litigation gain, the income tax charge associated with the repatriation of foreign earnings and the restructuring charges recorded in 2009 and 2008, adjusted net earnings increased 1% in 2009 to $1,180.0 million from $1,169.5 million in 2008. Adjusted basic net earnings per share increased 4% in 2009 to $2.97 from $2.87 in 2008 and adjusted diluted net earnings per share increased 4% in 2009 to $2.95 from $2.83 in 2008.

Net sales grew by 11% as a result of increased unit volume and changes in product mix and by 1% due to favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company’s domestic sales were $4,282.2 million for 2008, representing an increase of 11%, as a result of higher shipments of Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment. International sales were $2,436.0 million for 2008, representing an increase of 13%. The impact of foreign currency comparisons to the dollar value of international sales was favorable by $84.7 million for 2008. On a constant currency basis, international sales increased 9% in 2008 as a result of higher shipments of Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment. Worldwide sales of Orthopaedic Implants were $3,967.5 million for 2008, representing an increase of 11%. On a constant currency basis, sales of Orthopaedic Implants increased 9% in 2008 as a result of higher shipments of reconstructive, trauma, spinal and craniomaxillofacial implant systems and bone cement. 26 Table of Contents Hip Implant Systems: Sales of hip implant systems increased 3% in 2008 (1% on a constant currency basis). In the United States, sales growth was driven by increased sales of the Cormet Hip Resurfacing product and sales growth in X3 Polyethylene and Accolade cementless hip products, partially offset by declines in other hip systems. Sales growth in several hip systems, including Accolade, X3 Polyethylene and ABG II in Europe and Secur-Fit in Japan and the Pacific region, also contributed to the Company’s constant currency sales growth in 2008. Knee Implant Systems: Sales of knee implant systems increased 14% in 2008 (13% on a constant currency basis) due to strong sales growth in the Triathlon Knee System in the United States, Europe, Canada and the Pacific region and solid sales growth in the Scorpio Knee System in Japan and the Latin America region. Trauma Implant Systems: Sales of trauma implant systems increased 18% in 2008 (14% on a constant currency basis) as a result of strong worldwide sales growth in the Gamma3 Hip Fracture System and the SPS Calcaneal Foot Plating System and strong sales growth in the Company’s T2 Nailing System in the United States, Canada and the Pacific region. Strong sales growth in the HydroSet injectable bone substitute product in the United States and the Pacific region also contributed to the Company’s constant currency sales growth in 2008. Spinal Implant Systems: Sales of spinal implant systems increased 19% in 2008 (18% on a constant currency basis). The increase was driven by strong worldwide sales growth of thoracolumbar implant systems, interbody devices and cervical implants. Craniomaxillofacial Implant Systems: Sales of craniomaxillofacial implant systems increased 16% in 2008 (15% on a constant currency basis) primarily due to strong sales growth of products for neurological indications and craniomaxillofacial implants and the HydroSet injectable bone substitute product in the United States and the Pacific region. Worldwide sales of MedSurg Equipment were $2,750.7 million for 2008, representing an increase of 14%. On a constant currency basis, sales of MedSurg Equipment increased 13% in 2008 as a result of higher shipments of surgical equipment and surgical navigation systems; endoscopic, communications and digital imaging systems; as well as patient handling and emergency medical equipment. Surgical Equipment and Surgical Navigation Systems: Sales of surgical equipment and surgical navigation systems increased 17% in 2008 (15% on a constant currency basis) due to strong worldwide sales growth in powered surgical and operating room equipment as well as solid sales growth in interventional pain products in the United States and the Pacific region. Endoscopic and Communications: Sales of endoscopic and communications systems increased 9% in 2008 (8% on a constant currency basis) as a result of strong worldwide sales growth in arthroscopy and general surgery as well as strong international sales growth of medical video imaging equipment, led by the 1188 HD camera and complimentary products, partially offset by lower sales of medical video imaging equipment in the United States. Strong sales growth in communication products, led by the SwitchPoint Infinity 2, in the United States and Canada also contributed to the Company’s constant currency sales growth. Patient Handling and Emergency Medical Equipment: Sales of patient handling and emergency medical equipment increased 18% in 2008 (17% on a constant currency basis) due to strong sales growth of hospital bed products in the United States and the Latin America region and stretchers and emergency medical equipment in the United States and Europe. Cost of sales represented 31.7% of sales in 2008 compared with 31.1% in 2007. The increase in the cost of sales percentage is primarily due to increased compliance initiative spending and higher commodity and freight costs. 27 Table of Contents Research, development and engineering expenses represented 5.5% of sales in 2008 compared with 6.3% in 2007. As anticipated, the spending level in 2008 decreased by 2% to $367.8 million as the Company implemented a more normalized level of spending for these costs compared to prior periods as well as the Company’s focus of certain research and development resources on compliance initiatives, which has slowed down some research and development projects and reduced outside contractor spending on certain projects. New product introductions in 2008 for the Orthopaedic Implants segment included the Tritanium Primary Hip System; the Triathlon TS Revision Knee System; the Triathlon Partial Knee Resurfacing System; the Asnis Screw System; the VariAx Hand and Foot Trauma Systems; and the Xia III Thoracolumbar Spinal System. Within the MedSurg Equipment segment, new product introductions in 2008 included the S3 Med/Surg Hospital Bed and the Neptune 2 Waste Management System. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 10% in 2008 and represented 39.1% of sales compared with 39.9% in 2007. The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales in 2008 is due to tight control of discretionary spending in the second half of 2008 partially offset by increases in sales-related costs and costs associated with compliance activities. In 2008 the Company recorded $34.9 million ($21.7 million net of income taxes) in restructuring charges related to the decisions to simplify the structure of the Company’s Japanese distribution business and to substantially reduce development efforts associated with Sightline product technologies acquired in 2006. In 2007 the Company recorded a $19.8 million charge ($12.7 million net of income taxes) to write off patents associated with intervertebral body fusion cage products. The impairment followed a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) decision to downgrade certain intervertebral body fusion products to Class II devices, along with a weak market for sales of these specific products. As a result, the Company performed a discounted cash flow analysis over the remaining life of the patented technologies and determined that the charge was required. Interest and marketable securities income, which is included in other income (expense), increased to $97.7 million in 2008 from $85.5 million in 2007 primarily as a result of increased average cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities balances in 2008 compared to 2007. Interest expense, which is included in other income (expense), increased to $30.5 million in 2008 from $22.2 million in 2007, primarily as a result of interest expense associated with unresolved income tax positions. The Company’s effective income tax rate on earnings from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2008 was 27.4% compared to an effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2007 of 28.0%. The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2008 reflects the impact of the restructuring charges of $21.7 million (net of $13.2 million income tax benefits). The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2007 reflects the impact of the intangible asset impairment charge of $12.7 million (net of $7.1 million income tax benefit). In addition to these factors, the Company’s reported effective income tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 are lower than the U.S. statutory income tax rate primarily as a result of manufacturing in lower income tax jurisdictions. Net earnings from continuing operations increased 16% in 2008 to $1,147.8 million from $986.7 million in 2007. Basic net earnings per share from continuing operations increased 17% in 2008 to $2.81 from $2.41 in 2007, and diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations increased 17% in 2008 to $2.78 from $2.37 in 2007. Excluding the impact of the restructuring charges recorded in 2008 and the charge to reflect the intangible asset impairment in 2007, adjusted net earnings from continuing operations increased 17% in 2008 to $1,169.5 million from $999.4 million in 2007. Adjusted basic net earnings per share from continuing operations increased 18% in 2008 to $2.87 from $2.44 in 2007, and adjusted diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations increased 18% in 2008 to $2.83 from $2.40 in 2007. 28 Table of Contents The reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures are as follows (in millions, except per share amounts): 2008 2007 PercentageChange Reported net earnings from continuing operations $ 1,147.8 $ 986.7 16 Restructuring charges 21.7 — — Intangible asset impairment — 12.7 (100 ) Adjusted net earnings from continuing operations $ 1,169.5 $ 999.4 17 Basic net earnings per share of common stock from continuing operations: Reported basic net earnings per share from continuing operations $ 2.81 $ 2.41 17 Restructuring charges $ 0.05 — — Intangible asset impairment — $ 0.03 (100 ) Adjusted basic net earnings per share from continuing operations $ 2.87 $ 2.44 18 Weighted-average basic shares outstanding 408.1 409.7 Diluted net earnings per share of common stock from continuing operations: Reported diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations $ 2.78 $ 2.37 17 Restructuring charges $ 0.05 — — Intangible asset impairment — $ 0.03 (100 ) Adjusted diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations $ 2.83 $ 2.40 18 Weighted-average diluted shares outstanding 413.6 417.2 The weighted-average basic and diluted shares outstanding used in the calculation of these non-GAAP financial measures are the same as the weighted-average shares outstanding used in the calculation of the reported per share amounts. Net earnings for the year ended December 31, 2007 included a gain of $25.7 million (net of income taxes), or $0.06 per diluted share, to reflect the divestiture of the Company’s outpatient physical therapy business, Physiotherapy Associates, and net earnings from discontinued operations of $5.0 million, or $0.01 per diluted share. Net earnings increased 13% in 2008 to $1,147.8 million from $1,017.4 million in 2007. Basic net earnings per share increased 13% in 2008 to $2.81 from $2.48 in 2007, and diluted net earnings per share increased 14% in 2008 to $2.78 from $2.44 in 2007. Liquidity and Capital Resources The Company’s working capital at December 31, 2009 increased $893.0 million to $4,410.2 million from $3,517.2 million at December 31, 2008. The increase in working capital resulted from cash earnings, increases in accounts receivable and prepaid expenses partially offset by the use of cash to fund dividend payments and acquisitions. The increase in working capital is also due to the reclassification of auction rate securities (ARS) from non-current assets to current assets within the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2009, as more fully described below. Accounts receivable days sales outstanding was 56 days at December 31, 2009 and 59 days at December 31, 2008. Days sales in inventory decreased by 10 days to 145 days at December 31, 2009 from 155 days at December 31, 2008. Days sales in inventory at December 31, 2009 is lower than the December 31, 2008 level primarily due to lower levels of inventory resulting from a slowdown in sales as well as higher excess and obsolete inventory costs associated with the Orthopaedic Implants businesses. The Company generated cash of $1,460.7 million from operations in 2009 compared with $1,175.9 million in 2008. The increase in cash from operations in 2009 is primarily due to a reduction in inventories, slower growth in accounts receivable and increases in income taxes payable. 29 Table of Contents In 2009 the Company used cash of $131.3 million for capital expenditures. In addition, the Company used cash of $198.4 million for the payment of dividends and $570.2 million of cash to fund acquisitions. The Company also purchased and sold marketable securities, which are classified as available-for-sale investments in accordance with the provisions of the Investments-Debt and Equity Securities Topic of the Financial Accounting Standard Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (Codification). The Company had $658.7 million in cash and cash equivalents and $2,296.1 million in current marketable securities at December 31, 2009. The Company had outstanding borrowings totaling $18.0 million at that date, all of which were classified as current obligations. The Company believes its cash on hand and marketable securities, proceeds from the January 2010 note offering as more fully described below as well as anticipated cash flows from operations, will be sufficient to fund future operating capital requirements; future manufacturing facility construction and other capital expenditures; future business and product line acquisitions to supplement its current product offerings; loaner instrumentation for surgical implants in support of new product launches; required debt repayments and the payment of dividends. On January 15, 2010, the Company sold $500.0 million of senior unsecured notes due January 15, 2015 (the “2015 Notes”) and $500.0 million of senior unsecured notes due January 15, 2020 (the “2020 Notes”). The 2015 Notes will bear interest at 3.00% per year and, unless previously redeemed, will mature on January 15, 2015. The 2020 Notes will bear interest at 4.375% per year and, unless previously redeemed, will mature on January 15, 2020. The Company intends to use the net proceeds from the offering for working capital and other general corporate purposes, including acquisitions, stock repurchases and other business opportunities. Should additional funds be required, the Company had $1,049.2 million of additional borrowing capacity available under all of its existing credit facilities as of December 31, 2009, including the Company’s $1,000.0 million 5-year nonamortizing, revolving Unsecured Credit Facility that expires in November 2010. The Company’s additional borrowing capacity, along with the expected expiration period of the commitments, is summarized as follows (in millions): TotalAmountCommitted Amount ofCommitmentExpiration Per Period Less Than1 Year In Excessof 1 Year Unsecured Credit Facility and other lines of credit $ 1,049.2 $ 1,015.3 $ 33.9 The Company reviews declines in the fair value of its investments classified as available-for-sale for impairment in accordance with the provisions of the Investments-Debt and Equity Securities Topic of the FASB Codification in order to determine whether the decline in fair value is an other-than-temporary impairment. Other-than-temporary impairments of available-for-sale marketable securities are recorded in earnings. Beginning in February 2008, liquidity issues in the global credit markets resulted in the failure of auctions for all of the ARS investments held by the Company, as the amount of securities submitted for sale in those auctions exceeded the amount of purchase bids. To date, the Company has collected all interest receivable on outstanding ARS when due and expects to continue to do so in the future. Due to current market conditions, the ARS investments have continued to experience failed auctions. These failed auctions result in a lack of liquidity in the securities but do not affect the underlying collateral of the securities. The Company does not anticipate that the lack of liquidity in its ARS, even for an extended period of time, will affect its ability to finance its operations, including its expansion programs and planned capital expenditures. The Company continues to monitor efforts by the financial markets to find alternative means for restoring the liquidity of these investments. As of December 31, 2009, the Company held $156.3 million, at par value, of ARS investments. In 2008 the Company entered into an ARS Rights agreement (Rights) with UBS Financial Services Inc. (UBS), one of its investment providers, whereby the Company received the right to sell its ARS at par value to UBS at any time 30 Table of Contents during the period June 30, 2010 through July 2, 2012. These Rights are nontransferable securities registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (U.S. SEC). As a result of accepting the ARS Rights, the Company has released UBS and its employees/agents from all claims except claims for consequential damages directly or indirectly relating to UBS’s marketing and sale of ARS and agreed not to serve as a class representative or receive benefits under any class action settlement or investor fund. The Company has elected to apply the fair value option to its ARS Rights pursuant to the provisions of the Financial Instruments Topic of the FASB Codification. As a result of this election, in the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2009, the Company recorded a loss of $11.0 million in other income (expense) to recognize the change in fair value estimate of its ARS Rights; the loss was offset by a corresponding gain in the fair value estimate of the related trading marketable securities. The Company intends to exercise its ARS Rights described above when it becomes due and has, therefore, reclassified the ARS as current marketable securities within its Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2009. The Company’s future contractual obligations for agreements with initial terms greater than 1 year, including agreements to purchase materials in the normal course of business, are summarized as follows (in millions): Payment Period Total 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 After 2014 Long-term debt $ 18.0 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 18.0 Operating leases 49.0 34.3 26.3 19.4 14.3 24.8 168.1 Unconditional purchase obligations 388.9 124.5 16.2 1.9 1.3 1.3 534.1 Contributions to defined benefit plans 19.0 — — — — — 19.0 Other 4.0 2.1 1.6 2.1 1.3 46.4 57.5 $ 478.9 $ 160.9 $ 44.1 $ 23.4 $ 16.9 $ 72.5 $ 796.7 As further described in Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, as of December 31, 2009 the Company’s defined benefit pension plans are in an underfunded status of $85.1 million. Due to the rules affecting tax-deductible contributions in the jurisdictions in which the plans are offered and the impact of future plan asset performance, changes in interest rates and the potential for changes in legislation in the United States and other foreign jurisdictions, the Company is not able to reasonably estimate the future periods, beyond 2010, in which contributions to fund defined benefit pension plans will be made. As further described in Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, as of December 31, 2009, the Company has recorded a liability for unresolved income tax positions of $292.7 million. Due to uncertainties regarding the ultimate resolution of income tax audits, the Company is not able to reasonably estimate the amount or the future periods in which income tax payments to settle these unresolved income tax positions will be made. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Management evaluates these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Estimates are based on historical experience, when available, and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Management believes that, of its significant accounting policies (see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), an understanding of the following critical accounting policies is important in obtaining an overall understanding of the Consolidated Financial Statements. 31 Table of Contents Allowance for Doubtful Accounts The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses in the collection of accounts receivable. The Company makes estimates regarding the future ability of its customers to make required payments based on historical credit experience and expected future trends. If actual customer financial conditions are less favorable than projected by management, additional accounts receivable write offs may be necessary, which could unfavorably affect future operating results. Inventory Reserves The Company maintains reserves for excess and obsolete inventory resulting from the potential inability to sell its products at prices in excess of current carrying costs. The markets in which the Company operates are highly competitive and new products and surgical procedures are introduced on an ongoing basis. These marketplace changes may cause some of the Company’s products to become obsolete. The Company makes estimates regarding the future recoverability of the costs of these products and records a provision for excess and obsolete inventories based on historical experience, expiration of sterilization dates and expected future trends. If actual product life cycles, product demand or acceptance of new product introductions are less favorable than projected by management, additional inventory write downs may be required, which could unfavorably affect future operating results. Income Taxes The Company operates in multiple income tax jurisdictions both inside and outside the United States. Accordingly, management must determine the appropriate allocation of income to each of these jurisdictions. Income tax audits associated with the allocation of this income and other complex issues, including inventory transfer pricing and cost sharing and product royalty arrangements, may require an extended period of time to resolve and may result in income tax adjustments if changes to the income allocation are required between jurisdictions with different income tax rates. Because income tax adjustments in certain jurisdictions can be significant, the Company records accruals representing management’s best estimate of the probable resolution of these matters. To the extent additional information becomes available, such accruals are adjusted to reflect the revised estimated probable outcome. Recently Adopted Accounting Standards In 2009 the Company adopted the provisions of the Business Combinations Topic of the FASB Codification. This topic significantly changes the principles and requirements for how an acquisition is recognized and measured in financial statements, including the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. This topic also provides guidance for recognizing and measuring goodwill acquired in a business combination and requires disclosures to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination. The additional disclosure requirements regarding the Business Combinations Topic of the FASB Codification are included in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In 2008 the Company adopted the provisions of the Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures Topic of the FASB Codification for financial assets and liabilities measured on a recurring basis. This topic applies to all financial assets and financial liabilities that are being measured and reported on a fair value basis, establishes a framework for measuring fair value of assets and liabilities and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. There was no impact to the Consolidated Financial Statements as a result of the adoption of this topic. The additional disclosure requirements regarding fair value measurements are included in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In 2009 the Company adopted the non-financial assets and liabilities guidance of the Fair Value Measurement and Disclosures Topic that were previously deferred. In 2008 the Company adopted the provisions of the Financial Instruments Topic of the FASB Codification. This topic allows companies the option to measure eligible financial instruments at fair value. Such election, which may be applied on an instrument by instrument basis, is typically irrevocable once elected. The Company has elected to apply the fair value option to its ARS Rights agreement as more fully described in Liquidity and Capital Resources. 32 Table of Contents Other Matters The Company distributes its products throughout the world. As a result, the Company’s financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as weak economic conditions or changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company’s operating results are primarily exposed to changes in exchange rates among the U.S. dollar, European currencies, in particular the euro and the British pound, the Japanese yen, the Australian dollar and the Canadian dollar. When the U.S. dollar weakens against foreign currencies, the dollar value of sales denominated in foreign currencies increases. When the U.S. dollar strengthens, the opposite situation occurs. The Company develops and manufactures its products in the United States, Canada, China, France, Germany, Ireland, Puerto Rico and Switzerland and incurs costs in the applicable local currencies. This worldwide deployment of facilities serves to partially mitigate the impact of currency exchange rate changes on the Company’s cost of sales. The Company enters into forward currency exchange contracts to mitigate the impact of currency fluctuations on transactions denominated in nonfunctional currencies, thereby limiting risk to the Company that would otherwise result from changes in exchange rates. These nonfunctional currency exposures principally relate to intercompany receivables and payables arising from intercompany purchases of manufactured products as well as, in 2009, intercompany loans associated with the repatriation of foreign earnings. The periods of the forward currency exchange contracts correspond to the periods of the exposed transactions, with realized gains and losses included in the measurement and recording of transactions denominated in the nonfunctional currencies. All forward currency exchange contracts are recorded at their fair value each period, with resulting gains (losses) included in other income (expense) in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. At December 31, 2009, the Company had outstanding forward currency exchange contracts to purchase $2,041.1 million and sell $280.5 million of various currencies (principally U.S. dollars and euros) with maturities ranging from 4 to 106 days. At December 31, 2008, the Company had outstanding forward currency exchange contracts to purchase $412.5 million and sell $288.4 million of various currencies (principally U.S. dollars and euros) with maturities ranging from 2 to 110 days. The estimated fair value of forward currency exchange contracts represents the measurement of the contracts at month-end spot rates as adjusted by current forward points. A hypothetical 10% change in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar would change the December 31, 2009 fair value by approximately $79.1 million. The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties on its outstanding forward currency exchange contracts but does not anticipate nonperformance by any of the counterparties. The Company has certain investments in net assets in international locations that are not hedged. These investments are subject to translation gains and losses due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. For the year ended December 31, 2009, the strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar increased the value of these investments in net assets and the related foreign currency translation adjustment gain in shareholders’ equity by $73.8 million to $277.5 million from $203.7 million at December 31, 2008. In 2009 the Company received a subpoena from the Attorney General of New Jersey requesting various documents related to the financial interests and arrangements of physicians participating in certain clinical trials for or on behalf of the Company. The Company is evaluating the scope of the subpoena and its response. The Attorney General of New Jersey reportedly issued similar subpoenas to other major medical device manufacturing companies. In 2009 a federal grand jury in the District of Massachusetts returned an indictment charging Stryker Biotech LLC and certain current and former employees of Stryker Biotech with wire fraud, conspiracy to defraud the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), distribution of a misbranded device and false statements to the FDA. The Company still hopes to be able to reach a fair and just resolution of this matter. Conviction of these charges could result in significant monetary fines and Stryker Biotech’s exclusion from participating in federal and state health care programs, which could have a material affect on Stryker Biotech’s business. However, the ultimate resolution of these matters is not reasonably estimatable at this time. The Company understands that certain former Stryker Biotech employees have pled guilty to charges in connection with this matter. 33 Table of Contents In 2009 the Company received a warning letter from the U.S. FDA related to compliance issues for one of its craniomaxillofacial (CMF) implant products that was previously sold through its CMF distribution facility in Portage, Michigan. In 2008 the Company received a warning letter from the FDA related to quality systems and compliance issues at its OP-1 implant manufacturing facility in Hopkinton, Massachusetts. In 2007 the Company received two warning letters from the FDA regarding compliance with certain quality system specifications at its reconstructive implant manufacturing facilities: one letter for its facility in Cork, Ireland and another for its facility in Mahwah, New Jersey. In October 2009, the FDA informed the Company that the warning letter related to its OP-1 implant manufacturing facility had been resolved following a productive reinspection earlier in 2009. The Company takes these matters very seriously and continues to fully cooperate with the FDA to address their observations at the other facilities. In 2007 the Company announced that it reached a resolution with the U.S. Attorney’s office for the District of New Jersey in connection with a previously announced investigation relating to “any and all consulting contracts, professional service agreements, or remuneration agreements between Stryker Corporation and any orthopedic surgeon, orthopedic surgeon in training, or medical school graduate using or considering the surgical use of hip or knee joint replacement/reconstruction products manufactured or sold by Stryker Corporation.” The resolution was in the form of a non-prosecution agreement for an 18-month period that ended on March 27, 2009. During the term of the agreement, the Company’s Orthopaedics subsidiary was subject to oversight by a federal monitor, as appointed by the U.S. Attorney, regarding compliance with certain standards and procedures in connection with the retention and payment of orthopaedic surgeon consultants related to reconstructive products and the provision of certain benefits to such surgeons. Subsequent to entering into the non-prosecution agreement, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Inspector General (HHS) issued a civil subpoena to the Company in seeking to determine whether the Company violated various laws by paying consulting fees and providing other things of value to orthopedic surgeons and healthcare and educational institutions as inducements to use Stryker’s orthopedic medical devices in procedures paid for in whole or in part by Medicare. The Company produced numerous documents and other materials to HHS in response to the subpoena and had been working with HHS to attempt to narrow the scope of the requested production. In 2008 the U.S. Department of Justice and HHS sought judicial enforcement of the subpoena and a court agreed to enforce it in January 2009. At the same time, the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey dismissed the Company’s complaint, which had asked the court to quash the subpoena and sought other appropriate relief on the grounds that the subpoena was overbroad and oppressive. In 2007 the Company disclosed that the U.S. SEC made an informal inquiry of the Company regarding possible violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in connection with the sale of medical devices in certain foreign countries. Subsequently, in 2008, the Company received a subpoena from the U.S. Department of Justice, Criminal Division, requesting certain documents for the period since January 1, 2000 in connection with the U.S. SEC inquiry. The Company is fully cooperating with the U.S. Department of Justice and the U.S. SEC regarding these matters. The Company is partially self-insured for product liability claims and utilizes a wholly owned captive insurance company in the United States to manage its self-insured retention limits. The captive insurance company provides insurance reserves for estimated liabilities for product claims incurred but not reported based on actuarially determined liabilities. The actuarial valuations are based on historical information along with certain assumptions about future events. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk are included in the “Results of Operations, Liquidity and Capital Resources” and “Other Matters” sections of the Company’s Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition in Item 7 of this report. 34 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 18:43:12.434380
310764,SYK,STRYKER CORP,2011,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. Throughout this discussion, references are made to the following financial measures: “constant currency,” “adjusted net earnings,” “adjusted basic net earnings per share,” and “adjusted diluted net earnings per share.” These financial measures are an alternative representation of Stryker Corporation’s (the Company or Stryker) past and potential future operational performance and do not replace the presentation of the Company’s reported financial results under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The Company has provided these supplemental non-GAAP financial measures because they provide meaningful information regarding the Company’s results on a consistent and comparable basis for the periods presented. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures for reviewing the operating results of its business segments, for analyzing potential future business trends in connection with its budget process and bases certain annual bonus plans on these non-GAAP financial measures. In order to measure the Company’s sales performance on a constant currency basis, it is necessary to remove the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates which affects the comparability and trend of sales. Constant currency results are calculated by translating current year results at prior year average foreign currency exchange rates. In order to measure earnings performance on a consistent and comparable basis, the Company excludes the impairment of property, plant and equipment and gain on sale of certain assets recorded in 2010, the patent litigation gain recorded in 2009, the income tax effect associated with the repatriation of foreign earnings recorded in 2010 and 2009 and the restructuring charges recorded in 2009 and 2008, each of which affects the comparability of operating results and the trend of earnings. Additional details regarding the nature, determination and financial statement impact of these items are included in Results of Operations. In addition, the Company believes investors will utilize this information to evaluate period-to-period results on a comparable basis and to better understand potential future operating results. The Company encourages investors and other users of these financial statements to review its Consolidated Financial Statements and other publicly filed reports in their entirety and not to rely solely on any single financial measure.

The Company provides innovative orthopaedic implants as well as state-of-the-art medical and surgical equipment to help people lead more active and more satisfying lives. The Company’s products include implants used in joint replacement, trauma and spinal surgeries; surgical equipment and surgical navigation systems; endoscopic and communications systems; patient handling and emergency medical equipment as well as other medical device products used in a variety of medical specialties. 20 Table of Contents Domestic sales accounted for 65% of total revenues in 2010. Most of the Company’s products are marketed directly to doctors, hospitals and other healthcare facilities by approximately 4,600 sales and marketing personnel in the United States. Stryker primarily maintains separate and dedicated sales forces for each of its principal product lines to provide focus and a high level of expertise to each medical specialty served. International sales accounted for 35% of total revenues in 2010. The Company’s products are sold in approximately 100 countries through Company-owned sales subsidiaries and branches as well as third-party dealers and distributors. The Company’s business is generally not seasonal in nature; however, the number of orthopaedic implant surgeries is lower during the summer months. In 2010 the Company completed several acquisitions in all cash transactions, including the Sonopet Ultrasonic Aspirator control consoles, handpieces and accessories from Mutoh Co., Ltd. and Synergetics USA, Inc., Gaymar Industries Inc, and the bioimplantable implants product line and related assets from Porex Surgical, Inc. In December 2010 the Company announced a definitive agreement to sell its OP-1 product family for use in orthopaedic bone applications and its manufacturing facility based in Lebanon, NH and the transaction was completed on February 1, 2011. Additional details, including the financial statement impact of this transaction, are included in Results of Operations. In October 2010 the Company announced a definitive agreement to acquire the assets of the Neurovascular division of Boston Scientific Corporation (Neurovascular) in an all cash transaction of up to $1.5 billion. The transaction was completed on January 3, 2011. The acquisition of Neurovascular is expected to substantially enhance the Company’s presence in the neurovascular market, allowing it to offer a comprehensive portfolio of products in both neurosurgical and neurovascular devices. During the third quarter of 2010, the Company sold its Orthopaedics Implants manufacturing facility based in Caen, France. In addition, during the third quarter of 2010, the Company recorded a favorable income tax adjustment of $7.4 million to reduce the income tax liability originally recorded in the fourth quarter of 2009 associated with the repatriation of foreign earnings to the United States. Additional details, including the financial statement impact of these transactions, are included in Results of Operations. In August 2010 the Company refinanced its credit facility with a new $1,000.0 million Senior Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility due August 2013 (the 2010 Facility). The 2010 Facility replaced the previously outstanding $1,000.0 million Unsecured Credit Facility due in November 2010 (the 2005 Facility). Additional details are included in Liquidity and Capital Resources. In January 2010 the Company sold $500.0 million of senior unsecured notes due January 15, 2015 (the 2015 Notes) and $500.0 million of senior unsecured notes due January 15, 2020 (the 2020 Notes). The net proceeds from the offering have been and will continue to be available for working capital and other general corporate purposes, including acquisitions, stock repurchases and other business opportunities. Additional details are included in Liquidity and Capital Resources. 21 Table of Contents Results of Operations The table below outlines the components of net earnings from continuing operations from the Consolidated Statements of Earnings as a percentage of net sales and the year-to-year percentage change in dollar amounts: Percentage of Net Sales Percentage Change 2010 2009 2008 2010/2009 2009/2008 Net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 9 % 0 % Cost of sales 31.2 32.5 31.7 5 2 Gross profit 68.8 67.5 68.3 11 (1 ) Research, development and engineering expenses 5.4 5.0 5.5 17 (9 ) Selling, general and administrative expenses 37.0 37.3 39.1 8 (5 ) Intangibles amortization 0.8 0.5 0.6 64 (11 ) Property, plant and equipment impairment 1.7 — — — — Restructuring charges — 1.0 0.5 (100 ) 92 Operating income 23.9 23.7 22.6 10 5 Other income (expense) (0.3 ) 0.4 0.9 — (52 ) Earnings before income taxes 23.6 24.2 23.5 7 3 Income taxes 6.2 7.7 6.4 (12 ) 19 Net earnings 17.4 % 16.5 % 17.1 % 15 (4 ) The Company segregates its operations into two reportable business segments: Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment. The Orthopaedic Implants segment includes orthopaedic reconstructive (hip and knee), trauma and spinal implant systems and other related products. The MedSurg Equipment segment includes surgical equipment and surgical navigation systems; endoscopic and communications systems; patient handling and emergency medical equipment; as well as other medical device products used in a variety of medical specialties.

Net sales grew by 7% as a result of increased unit volume and changes in product mix, 1% due to the favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates on net sales and 3% due to acquisitions, which were partially offset by an unfavorable impact of 2% due to changes in price. The Company’s domestic sales were $4,792.8 million for 2010, representing an increase of 11%, as a result of higher shipments of Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment. International sales were $2,527.2 million for 2010, representing an increase of 5%. The impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements to the dollar value of international sales was favorable by $69.7 million for 2010. On a constant currency basis, international sales increased 2% in 2010 as a result of higher shipments of Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment. 23 Table of Contents Worldwide sales of Orthopaedic Implants were $4,308.4 million for 2010, representing an increase of 5%. On a constant currency basis, sales of Orthopaedic Implants increased 3% in 2010 as a result of higher shipments of hips, knees, trauma and spinal implant systems. Hip Implant Systems: Sales of hip implant systems increased 5% in 2010 (3% on a constant currency basis). In the United States, sales growth of hip products was driven by sales of X3 Polyethylene, Rejuvenate hip products, Accolade cementless hip products and Restoration Modular Hip System revision hip products. Sales growth in X3 Polyethylene hip products in Europe, Canada, the Pacific and Latin America regions as well as sales growth in Trident hip products in Japan and the Pacific and Latin America regions also contributed to the Company’s constant currency sales growth in 2010. Sales growth in Accolade cementless hip products in Europe, Japan and the Latin America region also contributed to the Company’s constant currency sales growth in 2010. Knee Implant Systems: Sales of knee implant systems increased 4% in 2010 (3% on a constant currency basis) due to due to worldwide sales growth in the Triathlon knee system as well as sales growth in Scorpio knee products in the Latin America region. Trauma Implant Systems: Sales of trauma implant systems increased 8% in 2010 (7% on a constant currency basis) as a result of sales growth in the Gamma3 Hip Fracture System in the United States, Europe, Canada and the Pacific region as well as sales growth in the Company’s T2 Nailing System in the United States, Europe and the Pacific region. Sales growth in VariAx distal radius products in the United States, Europe, Canada, Japan and the Latin America region also contributed to the Company’s constant currency sales growth. Spinal Implant Systems: Sales of spinal implant systems increased 2% in 2010 (1% on a constant currency basis). The increase was driven by sales growth of thoracolumbar implant systems in the United States, Europe, Japan, Canada and the Latin America region, interbody device products in Japan and Canada as well as cervical implants in the United States and Canada. Worldwide sales of MedSurg Equipment were $3,011.6 million in 2010, representing an increase of 16%. On a constant currency basis, sales of MedSurg Equipment increased 15% in 2010 as a result of higher shipments of surgical equipment and surgical navigation systems, endoscopic and communications systems as well as patient handling and emergency medical equipment. Sales of MedSurg Equipment were also positively impacted by 7% from acquisitions and 1% from a one-time shipment of patient handling equipment. Surgical Equipment and Surgical Navigation Systems: Sales of surgical equipment and surgical navigation systems increased 8% in 2010 (8% on a constant currency basis) due to worldwide sales growth in operating room equipment as well as sales growth in powered surgical products in the United States, Europe, Canada, the Pacific and Latin America regions and sales growth in interventional pain products in the United States, Japan, Canada and the Latin America region. Endoscopic and Communications Systems: Sales of endoscopic and communications systems increased 7% in 2010 (6% on a constant currency basis) due to worldwide sales growth in general surgery products and sales growth in communications products in Europe, Japan and the Latin America region. Sales growth in medical video equipment in the United States, Japan, Canada, and the Pacific and Latin America regions also contributed to the Company’s constant currency sales growth. Patient Handling and Emergency Medical Equipment: Sales of patient handling and emergency medical equipment increased 20% in 2010 (18% on a constant currency basis) due to higher sales of hospital bed products and stretchers in the United States and the Latin America region. Strong sales growth of EMS products in the United States and the Pacific region also contributed to the Company’s constant currency sales growth. Sales of patient handling and emergency medical equipment in 2010 were also positively impacted by 3% from acquisitions and 3% from a one-time shipment of patient handling equipment. 24 Table of Contents Cost of sales represented 31.2% of sales in 2010 compared to 32.5% in 2009. The decrease in the cost of sales percentage is primarily due to lower excess and obsolete inventory charges, higher absorption due to higher production levels as well as a favorable impact from the effect of foreign currency exchange rates on costs from the Company’s Euro based manufacturing sites. Research, development and engineering expenses represented 5.4% of sales in 2010 compared to 5.0% in 2009. The spending level in 2010 increased by 17% to $393.9 million. The higher spending level is the result of the Company’s increased focus on new product development for anticipated future product launches and continued investments in new technologies. New product introductions in 2010 for the Orthopaedic Implants segment included the ADM X3 Mobile Bearing Acetabular system. Within the MedSurg equipment segment, new product introductions in 2010 included the Prime series of stretchers and the WiSe 1:3 Transmitter. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 8% in 2010 and represented 37.0% of sales compared to 37.3% in 2009. In 2010 the Company sold its Orthopaedic Implant manufacturing facility in Caen, France and recorded a gain of $24.3 million, which is included in selling, general and administrative expenses. In 2009 the Company settled an outstanding patent infringement lawsuit and received $62.5 million pursuant to a confidential settlement agreement. This gain also represented a reduction to selling, general and administrative expenses. The remaining decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales in 2010 is primarily due to management of discretionary spending levels. In 2010 the Company announced a definitive agreement to sell its OP-1 product family for use in orthopaedic bone applications and its manufacturing facility based in Lebanon, NH. As a result of the announcement, the Company recorded a $76.6 million (net of $46.9 million income tax expense) non-cash impairment charge to reflect the reduction of the carrying amount of the associated assets to their fair value. Interest and marketable securities income, which is included in other income (expense), decreased to $48.7 million in 2010 from $53.9 million in 2009 primarily as a result of lower average yields on the Company’s investments. Interest expense, which is also included in other income (expense), increased to $77.5 million in 2010 from $23.2 million in 2009 primarily as a result of the interest cost on the debt issued in January 2010. The Company’s effective income tax rate on earnings for the year ended December 31, 2010 was 26.4% compared to an effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2009 of 31.8%. The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2010 reflects the property, plant and equipment impairment charge of $76.6 million (net of $46.9 million income tax benefit), the gain on sale of the Caen facility of $13.4 million (net of $10.9 million income tax expense) and the impact of the favorable income tax expense adjustment of $7.4 million associated with the repatriation of foreign earnings to the United States completed in the fourth quarter of 2009. The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2009 reflects the impact of restructuring charges of $48.4 million (net of $18.6 million income tax benefits), the patent litigation gain of $42.9 million (net of $19.6 million income tax expenses) and the impact of the $67.1 million income tax expenses associated with the repatriation of foreign earnings of $787.0 million. The Company’s effective income tax rate on earnings for the fourth quarter of 2010 was 22.2% compared to the fourth quarter of 2009 of 41.5%. The effective income tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2010 reflects the property, plant and equipment impairment charge of $76.6 million (net of $46.9 million income tax benefit). The effective income tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2009 reflects the patent litigation gain of $42.9 million (net of $19.6 million income tax expenses) and the impact of the $67.1 million income tax expenses associated with the repatriation of foreign earnings of $787.0 million. In addition to these factors, the Company’s reported effective income tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 are lower than the U.S. statutory income tax rate primarily as a result of manufacturing in lower income tax jurisdictions. Net earnings increased 15% in 2010 to $1,273.4 million from $1,107.4 million in 2009. Basic net earnings per share increased 15% in 2010 to $3.21 from $2.79 in 2009, and diluted net earnings per share increased 15% to $3.19 in 2010 from $2.77 in 2009. 25 Table of Contents Excluding the impact of the property, plant and equipment impairment charge and gain on sale of certain assets recorded in 2010, the patent litigation gain recorded in 2009, the income tax adjustment associated with the repatriation of foreign earnings recorded in 2010 and 2009 and the restructuring charges recorded in 2009, adjusted net earnings increased 13% in 2010 to $1,329.2 million from $1,180.0 million in 2009. Adjusted basic net earnings per share increased 13% in 2010 to $3.35 from $2.97 in 2009 and adjusted diluted net earnings per share increased 13% in 2010 to $3.33 from $2.95 in 2009. The reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures are as follows (in millions, except per share amounts): 2010 2009 PercentageChange Reported net earnings $ 1,273.4 $ 1,107.4 15 Restructuring charges — 48.4 (100 ) Patent litigation gain — (42.9 ) (100 ) Gain on sale of property, plant and equipment (13.4 ) — — Income taxes on repatriation of foreign earnings (7.4 ) 67.1 — Impairment of property, plant and equipment 76.6 — — Adjusted net earnings $ 1,329.2 $ 1,180.0 13 Basic net earnings per share of common stock: Reported basic net earnings per share $ 3.21 $ 2.79 15 Restructuring charges — $ 0.12 (100 ) Patent litigation gain — $ (0.11 ) (100 ) Gain on sale of property, plant and equipment $ (0.03 ) — — Income taxes on repatriation of foreign earnings $ (0.02 ) $ 0.17 — Impairment of property, plant and equipment $ 0.19 — — Adjusted basic net earnings per share $ 3.35 $ 2.97 13 Weighted-average basic shares outstanding 396.4 397.4 Diluted net earnings per share of common stock: Reported diluted net earnings per share $ 3.19 $ 2.77 15 Restructuring charges — $ 0.12 (100 ) Patent litigation gain — $ (0.11 ) (100 ) Gain on sale of property, plant and equipment $ (0.03 ) — — Income taxes on repatriation of foreign earnings $ (0.02 ) $ 0.17 — Impairment of property, plant and equipment $ 0.19 — — Adjusted diluted net earnings per share $ 3.33 $ 2.95 13 Weighted-average diluted shares outstanding 399.5 399.4 The weighted-average basic and diluted shares outstanding used in the calculation of these non-GAAP financial measures are the same as the weighted-average shares outstanding used in the calculation of the reported per share amounts. 2009 Compared to 2008 The Company’s net sales increased to $6,723.1 million in 2009 from $6,718.2 million in 2008. Net sales grew by 2% as a result of increased unit volume and changes in product mix partially offset by unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company’s domestic sales were $4,317.4 million for 2009, representing an increase of 1%, as a result of higher shipments of Orthopaedic Implants partially offset by lower shipments of MedSurg Equipment. 26 Table of Contents International sales were $2,405.7 million for 2009, representing a decrease of 1%. The impact of foreign currency comparisons to the dollar value of international sales was unfavorable by $110.1 million for 2009. On a constant currency basis, international sales increased 3% in 2009 as a result of higher shipments of Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment. Worldwide sales of Orthopaedic Implants were $4,119.7 million for 2009, representing an increase of 4%. On a constant currency basis, sales of Orthopaedic Implants increased 6% in 2009 as a result of higher shipments of hips, knees, trauma, craniomaxillofacial and spinal implant systems. Hip Implant Systems: Sales of hip implant systems increased 2% in 2009 (5% on a constant currency basis). In the United States, sales growth was driven by Trident hip products, X3 Polyethylene hip products, Accolade cementless hip products and Restoration Modular Hip System revision hip products. Sales growth in several hip systems, including X3 Polyethylene and Accolade cementless hip products in Europe, Canada and the Latin America and Pacific regions and Trident hip products in Japan also contributed to the Company’s constant currency sales growth in 2009. Knee Implant Systems: Sales of knee implant systems increased 4% in 2009 (6% on a constant currency basis) due to strong sales growth in the Triathlon Knee System in the United States, Europe, Japan, Canada and the Pacific region and solid sales growth in the Scorpio Knee System in the Latin America region. Trauma Implant Systems: Sales of trauma implant systems increased 5% in 2009 (6% on a constant currency basis) as a result of sales growth in the Gamma 3 Hip Fracture System and the SPS Calcaneal Foot Plating System in the United States, Europe, Canada and the Latin America and Pacific regions as well as sales growth in the Company’s VariAx Distal Radius System in Europe, Canada and the Latin America region. Strong sales growth of the HydroSet injectable bone substitute product in the United States, Canada and the Pacific region also contributed to the Company’s constant currency sales growth in 2009. Spinal Implant Systems: Sales of spinal implant systems increased 10% in 2009 (11% on a constant currency basis). The increase was driven by strong worldwide sales growth of thoracolumbar implant systems, interbody devices and cervical implants in the United States, Europe and the Latin America and Pacific regions. Worldwide sales of MedSurg Equipment were $2,603.4 million for 2009, representing a decrease of 5%. The general economic slowdown in the United States resulted in a significant and rapid contraction in hospital capital budgets that depressed demand for certain MedSurg Equipment products. The severe weakening of the economy caused the Company’s hospital customers to reduce capital purchases, which generates the majority of sales within the MedSurg Equipment segment, to a degree not previously experienced in prior recessionary periods. On a constant currency basis, sales of MedSurg Equipment decreased 4% in 2009 as higher shipments of surgical equipment and surgical navigation systems were offset by lower shipments of endoscopic and communication systems as well as patient handling and emergency medical equipment. Surgical Equipment and Surgical Navigation Systems: Sales of surgical equipment and surgical navigation systems increased 1% in 2009 (2% on a constant currency basis) due to worldwide sales growth in operating room equipment as well as sales growth in powered surgical products in the United States, Europe, Japan and the Latin America region and sales growth in interventional pain products in the United States, Japan and the Pacific region. Endoscopic and Communications Systems: Sales of endoscopic and communications systems decreased 2% in 2009 (1% decrease on a constant currency basis) due to lower sales of medical video imaging equipment products and image portal products in the United States partially offset by worldwide sales growth in arthroscopy and general surgery products, sales growth in communications products in Japan and the Latin America and Pacific regions and medical video imaging equipment in Europe, Japan and the Latin America and Pacific regions. 27 Table of Contents Patient Handling and Emergency Medical Equipment: Sales of patient handling and emergency medical equipment decreased 22% in 2009 (20% decrease on a constant currency basis) due to lower worldwide sales of hospital bed products and stretchers in the United States, Europe, Canada and the Pacific and Latin America regions, partially offset by sales growth in stretchers in Japan and emergency medical equipment in the United States. Cost of sales represented 32.5% of sales in 2009 compared to 31.7% in 2008. The increase in the cost of sales percentage is primarily due to increased spending for compliance initiatives, higher excess and obsolete inventory costs associated with the Orthopaedic Implants businesses as well as higher unabsorbed costs due to lower production levels. Research, development and engineering expenses represented 5.0% of sales in 2009 compared to 5.5% in 2008. The spending level in 2009 decreased by 9% to $336.2 million due to tight control on discretionary spending as well as the Company’s continued focus of certain research and development resources on compliance initiatives. New product introductions in 2009 for the Orthopaedic Implants segment included the Rejuvenate Modular Primary Hip system, the VariAx elbow plating system and the Xia Uniplanar Titanium Spinal System. Within the MedSurg equipment segment, new product introductions in 2009 included the 1288 HD Camera, the Impression non-powered support surface, the Flyte Suit personal protection system and the RemB micro electric system. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 5% in 2009 and represented 37.3% of sales compared to 39.1% in 2008. In 2009 the Company settled an outstanding patent infringement lawsuit and received $62.5 million pursuant to a confidential settlement agreement. This gain represented a reduction to selling, general and administrative expenses. The remaining decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales in 2009 is due to tight control on discretionary spending that more than offset increased legal settlement costs, net of insurance recoveries, recorded for certain product liability claims. In 2009 the Company recorded $67.0 million ($48.4 million net of income taxes) in restructuring charges related to decisions to terminate certain third-party agent agreements at the Company’s EMEA Division, to simplify the organization structure at its Biotech, EMEA, Japan and Canada divisions and to discontinue selling certain products within its Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment segments. In 2008 the Company recorded $34.9 million ($21.7 million net of income taxes) in restructuring charges related to the decisions to simplify the structure of the Company’s Japanese distribution business and to substantially reduce development efforts associated with Sightline product technologies acquired in 2006. Interest and marketable securities income, which is included in other income (expense), decreased to $53.9 million in 2009 from $97.7 million in 2008 primarily as a result of lower average yields on the Company’s investments. The Company’s effective income tax rate on earnings for the year ended December 31, 2009 was 31.8% compared to an effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2008 of 27.4%. The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2009 reflects the impact of restructuring charges of $48.4 million (net of $18.6 million income tax benefits), the patent litigation gain of $42.9 million (net of $19.6 million income tax expenses) and the impact of the $67.1 million income tax expenses associated with the repatriation of foreign earnings of $787.0 million. The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2008 reflects the impact of the restructuring charges of $21.7 million (net of $13.2 million income tax benefits). In addition to these factors, the Company’s reported effective income tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 are lower than the U.S. statutory income tax rate primarily as a result of manufacturing in lower income tax jurisdictions. Net earnings decreased 4% in 2009 to $1,107.4 million from $1,147.8 million in 2008. Basic net earnings per share decreased 1% in 2009 to $2.79 from $2.81 in 2008, and diluted net earnings per share decreased to $2.77 in 2009 from $2.78 in 2008. 28 Table of Contents Excluding the impact of the patent litigation gain and the income tax charge associated with the repatriation of foreign earnings recorded in 2009 and the restructuring charges recorded in 2009 and 2008, adjusted net earnings increased 1% in 2009 to $1,180.0 million from $1,169.5 million in 2008. Adjusted basic net earnings per share increased 4% in 2009 to $2.97 from $2.87 in 2008 and adjusted diluted net earnings per share increased 4% in 2009 to $2.95 from $2.83 in 2008. The reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures are as follows (in millions, except per share amounts): 2009 2008 PercentageChange Reported net earnings $ 1,107.4 $ 1,147.8 (4 ) Restructuring charges 48.4 21.7 123 Patent litigation gain (42.9 ) — — Income taxes on repatriation of foreign earnings 67.1 — — Adjusted net earnings $ 1,180.0 $ 1,169.5 1 Basic net earnings per share of common stock: Reported basic net earnings per share $ 2.79 $ 2.81 (1 ) Restructuring charges $ 0.12 $ 0.05 140 Patent litigation gain $ (0.11 ) — — Income taxes on repatriation of foreign earnings $ 0.17 — — Adjusted basic net earnings per share $ 2.97 $ 2.87 4 Weighted-average basic shares outstanding 397.4 408.1 Diluted net earnings per share of common stock: Reported diluted net earnings per share $ 2.77 $ 2.78 — Restructuring charges $ 0.12 $ 0.05 140 Patent litigation gain $ (0.11 ) — — Income taxes on repatriation of foreign earnings $ 0.17 — — Adjusted diluted net earnings per share $ 2.95 $ 2.83 4 Weighted-average diluted shares outstanding 399.4 413.6 The weighted-average basic and diluted shares outstanding used in the calculation of these non-GAAP financial measures are the same as the weighted-average shares outstanding used in the calculation of the reported per share amounts. Liquidity and Capital Resources The Company’s working capital at December 31, 2010 increased $1,616.2 million to $6,026.4 million from $4,410.2 million at December 31, 2009. The increase in working capital was primarily due to the issuance of $1,000.0 million of senior unsecured notes in January 2010 as well as increases in accounts receivable, inventories and prepaid expenses, partially offset by the use of cash to fund dividend payments and acquisitions. Accounts receivable days sales outstanding was 56 days at December 31, 2010 and 2009. Days sales in inventory increased by 9 days to 154 days at December 31, 2010 from 145 days at December 31, 2009. Days sales in inventory at December 31, 2010 is higher than the December 31, 2009 level primarily due to higher levels of inventory in support of anticipated 2011 sales growth. The Company generated cash of $1,547.4 million from operations in 2010 compared to $1,460.7 million in 2009. The increase in cash from operations in 2010 is primarily due to increased earnings partially offset by increased inventory levels and higher tax payments. 29 Table of Contents In 2010 the Company used cash of $425.5 million for the repurchase of common stock, $238.3 million for the payment of dividends, $182.1 million for capital expenditures and $265.4 million for acquisitions. On January 15, 2010, the Company sold $500.0 million of the 2015 Notes and $500.0 million of the 2020 Notes. The 2015 Notes bear interest at 3.00% per year and, unless previously redeemed, will mature on January 15, 2015. The 2020 Notes bear interest at 4.375% per year and, unless previously redeemed, will mature on January 15, 2020. The Company received net proceeds of $996.1 million, net of an offering discount of $3.9 million. The 2015 Notes and 2020 Notes carry effective interest rates of 3.02% and 4.46%, respectively. Debt issuance costs of $10.5 million were incurred in connection with the sale of the senior unsecured notes. These costs were capitalized and are amortized to interest expense over the lives of the related senior unsecured notes. The Company also purchased and sold marketable securities, including exercising its Auction Rate Securities (ARS) Rights agreement, which are classified as available-for-sale investments and trading marketable securities, respectively, in accordance with the provisions of the Investments-Debt and Equity Securities Topic of the Financial Accounting Standard Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (Codification). The Company had $1,757.6 million in cash and cash equivalents and $2,622.5 million in current marketable securities at December 31, 2010. The Company had outstanding borrowings totaling $1,021.8 million at December 31, 2010. On January 3, 2011 the Company completed the acquisition of the Neurovascular division from Boston Scientific Corporation. The initial payment of $1.45 billion was funded from the Company’s cash position. An addition $50.0 million will be payable upon completion of certain milestones. The Company believes its cash and current marketable securities on hand, anticipated future cash flows from operations and additional borrowing capacity under existing credit facilities will be sufficient to fund future operating capital requirements; future manufacturing facility construction and other capital expenditures; loaner instrumentation for surgical implants in support of new product launches; future debt service requirements; and the payment of dividends. In August 2010 the Company refinanced its credit facility with a new $1,000.0 million Senior Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility due August 2013 (the 2010 Facility). The 2010 Facility replaces the previously outstanding $1,000.0 million Unsecured Credit Facility due in November 2010 (the 2005 Facility). The 2010 Facility includes an increase option permitting the Company to increase the size of the facility up to an additional $500.0 million, a $500.0 million multicurrency sublimit (with no sublimit for euro borrowings), a $100.0 million letter of credit sublimit and other terms, conditions and covenants substantially the same as the 2005 Facility. The 2010 Facility has an annual facility fee ranging from 10 to 45 basis points and bears interest at LIBOR, as defined in the 2010 Facility agreement, plus an applicable margin ranging from 65 to 205 basis points, both of which are dependent on the Company’s credit rating. Based on the Company’s current credit ratings, the 2010 Facility has an annual facility fee of 12.5 basis points and an interest margin of 87.5 basis points. Should additional funds be required, the Company had $1,027.5 million of additional borrowing capacity available under all of its existing credit facilities as of December 31, 2010, including the 2010 Facility. The Company’s additional borrowing capacity, along with the expected expiration period of the commitments, is summarized as follows (in millions): TotalAmountCommitted Amount ofCommitmentExpiration Per Period Less Than1 Year In Excessof 1 Year Unsecured Credit Facility and other lines of credit $ 1,027.5 $ 117.1 $ 910.4 The Company reviews declines in the fair value of its investments classified as available-for-sale for impairment in accordance with the provisions of the Investments-Debt and Equity Securities Topic of the FASB Codification in order to determine whether the decline in fair value is an other-than-temporary impairment. Other-than-temporary impairments of available-for-sale marketable securities are recorded in earnings. 30 Table of Contents In June 2010 the Company exercised the ARS Rights agreement (ARS Rights) it had entered into in 2008 with UBS Financial Services Inc. (UBS), one of its investment providers, whereby the Company received the right to sell its ARS at par value to UBS at any time during the period from June 30, 2010 through July 2, 2012. Pursuant to this agreement, the Company redeemed its entire remaining outstanding ARS investment of $139.9 million par value in the second quarter. Prior to the exercise of the ARS Rights, the Company had applied the fair value option to its ARS Rights pursuant to the provisions of the Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Topic of the FASB Codification. As a result of this election, in the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2010, the Company recorded a loss of $17.0 million in other income (expense) to recognize the change in fair value estimate of its ARS Rights. These losses were offset by corresponding gains in the fair value estimate of the related ARS investment. The Company’s future contractual obligations for agreements with initial terms greater than 1 year, including agreements to purchase materials in the normal course of business, are summarized as follows (in millions): Payment Period 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 After 2015 Total Balance sheet obligations: Long-term debt $ 25.3 $ — $ — $ — $ 499.6 $ 496.9 $ 1,021.8 Contributions to defined benefit plans 18.7 — — — — — 18.7 Other 8.6 2.2 2.7 1.9 1.7 39.8 56.9 Off-balance sheet arrangements: Unconditional purchase obligations 548.8 181.0 140.6 120.1 91.5 — 1,082.0 Operating leases 48.2 36.0 24.8 17.4 12.3 10.2 148.9 $ 649.6 $ 219.2 $ 168.1 $ 139.4 $ 605.1 $ 546.9 $ 2,328.3 As further described in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, as of December 31, 2010 the Company’s defined benefit pension plans are in an underfunded status of $107.7 million. Due to the rules affecting tax-deductible contributions in the jurisdictions in which the plans are offered and the impact of future plan asset performance, changes in interest rates and the potential for changes in legislation in the United States and other foreign jurisdictions, the Company is not able to reasonably estimate the future periods, beyond 2011, in which contributions to fund defined benefit pension plans will be made. As further described in Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, as of December 31, 2010, the Company has recorded a liability for uncertain income tax positions of $365.6 million. Due to uncertainties regarding the ultimate resolution of income tax audits, the Company is not able to reasonably estimate the future periods in which income tax payments to settle these uncertain income tax positions will be made. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Management evaluates these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Estimates are based on historical experience, when available, and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Management believes that, of its significant accounting policies (see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), an understanding of the following critical accounting policies is important in obtaining an overall understanding of the Consolidated Financial Statements. 31 Table of Contents Allowance for Doubtful Accounts The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses in the collection of accounts receivable. The Company makes estimates regarding the future ability of its customers to make required payments based on historical credit experience and expected future trends. If actual customer financial conditions are less favorable than projected by management, additional accounts receivable write offs may be necessary, which could unfavorably affect future operating results. Inventory Reserves The Company maintains reserves for excess and obsolete inventory resulting from the potential inability to sell its products at prices in excess of current carrying costs. The markets in which the Company operates are highly competitive and new products and surgical procedures are introduced on an ongoing basis. These marketplace changes may cause some of the Company’s products to become obsolete. The Company makes estimates regarding the future recoverability of the costs of these products and records a provision for excess and obsolete inventories based on historical experience, expiration of sterilization dates and expected future trends. If actual product life cycles, product demand or acceptance of new product introductions are less favorable than projected by management, additional inventory write downs may be required, which could unfavorably affect future operating results. Income Taxes The Company operates in multiple income tax jurisdictions both inside and outside the United States. Accordingly, management must determine the appropriate allocation of income to each of these jurisdictions. Income tax audits associated with the allocation of this income and other complex issues, including inventory transfer pricing and cost sharing, product royalty and foreign branch arrangements, may require an extended period of time to resolve and may result in income tax adjustments if changes to the income allocation are required between jurisdictions with different income tax rates. Because income tax adjustments in certain jurisdictions can be significant, the Company records accruals representing management’s best estimate of the probable resolution of these matters. To the extent additional information becomes available, such accruals are adjusted to reflect the revised estimated probable outcome. Legal and Other Contingencies The Company is involved in various proceedings, legal actions and claims arising in the normal course of business, including proceedings related to product, labor and intellectual property, and other matters that are more fully described in Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The outcomes of these matters will generally not be known for prolonged periods of time. In certain of the legal proceedings, the claimants seek damages, as well as other compensatory relief, which could result in the payment of significant claims and settlements. For legal matters for which management has sufficient information to reasonably estimate the Company’s future obligations, a liability representing management’s best estimate of the probable cost, or the minimum of the range of probable losses when a best estimate within the range is not known, for the resolution of these legal matters is recorded. The estimates are based on consultation with legal counsel, previous settlement experience and settlement strategies. If actual outcomes are less favorable than those projected by management, additional expense may be incurred, which could unfavorably affect future operating results. To partially mitigate losses arising from unfavorable outcomes in such matters, the Company purchases third-party insurance coverage subject to certain deductibles and loss limitations. Future operating results may be unfavorably impacted by any settlement payments or losses beyond the amounts of insurance carried. In addition, such matters may negatively impact the Company’s ability to obtain cost-effective third-party insurance coverage in future periods. 32 Table of Contents Recently Adopted Accounting Standards In 2010 the Company adopted the provisions of the Improvement to Financial Reporting by Enterprises Involved with Variable Interest Entities Topic of the FASB Codification. The topic requires a qualitative approach to identifying a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity (VIE) and requires ongoing assessment of whether an entity is a VIE and whether an interest in a VIE makes the holder the primary beneficiary of the VIE. There was no impact to the Consolidated Financial Statements as a result of the adoption of this topic of the FASB Codification. In 2010 the Company adopted the provisions of the Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures Topic “Improving Disclosures About Fair Value Measurements” of the FASB Codification. This topic requires companies to make new disclosures about recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements, including significant transfers into and out of Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurements, and information on purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements on a gross basis in the reconciliation of Level 3 fair value measurements. The enhanced disclosures about recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements are included in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In 2009 the Company adopted the provisions of the Business Combinations Topic of the FASB Codification. This topic significantly changes the principles and requirements for how an acquisition is recognized and measured in financial statements, including the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. This topic also provides guidance for recognizing and measuring goodwill acquired in a business combination and requires disclosures to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination. The additional disclosure requirements regarding the Business Combinations Topic of the FASB Codification are included in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Other Matters The Company distributes its products throughout the world. As a result, the Company’s financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as weak economic conditions or changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company’s operating results are primarily exposed to changes in exchange rates among the U.S. dollar, European currencies, in particular the euro and the British pound, the Japanese yen, the Australian dollar and the Canadian dollar. When the U.S. dollar weakens against foreign currencies, the dollar value of sales denominated in foreign currencies increases. When the U.S. dollar strengthens, the opposite situation occurs. The Company develops and manufactures its products in the United States, China, France, Germany, Ireland, Puerto Rico and Switzerland and incurs costs in the applicable local currencies. This worldwide deployment of facilities serves to partially mitigate the impact of currency exchange rate changes on the Company’s cost of sales. The Company enters into forward currency exchange contracts to mitigate the impact of currency fluctuations on transactions denominated in nonfunctional currencies, thereby limiting risk to the Company that would otherwise result from changes in exchange rates. These nonfunctional currency exposures principally relate to intercompany receivables and payables arising from intercompany purchases of manufactured products as well as, in 2010, nonfunctional cash balances associated with the anticipated acquisition of the Neurovascular division from Boston Scientific and, in 2009, intercompany loans associated with the repatriation of foreign earnings. The periods of the forward currency exchange contracts correspond to the periods of the exposed transactions, with realized gains and losses included in the measurement and recording of transactions denominated in the nonfunctional currencies. All forward currency exchange contracts are recorded at their fair value each period, with resulting gains (losses) included in other income (expense) in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. At December 31, 2010, the Company had outstanding forward currency exchange contracts to purchase $1,011.9 million and sell $366.9 million of various currencies (principally U.S. dollars and euros) with maturities ranging from 7 to 99 days. At December 31, 2009, the Company had outstanding forward currency exchange 33 Table of Contents contracts to purchase $2,041.1 million and sell $280.5 million of various currencies (principally U.S. dollars and euros) with maturities ranging from 4 to 106 days. The estimated fair value of forward currency exchange contracts represents the measurement of the contracts at month-end spot rates as adjusted by current forward points. A hypothetical 10% change in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar would change the December 31, 2010 fair value by approximately $63.9 million. The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties on its outstanding forward currency exchange contracts but does not anticipate nonperformance by any of the counterparties. The Company has certain investments in net assets in international locations that are not hedged. These investments are subject to translation gains and losses due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. For the year ended December 31, 2010, the strengthening of U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies decreased the value of these investments in net assets and the related foreign currency translation adjustment loss in shareholders’ equity by $81.0 million to $196.5 million from $277.5 million at December 31, 2009. In the third quarter of 2010, the Company received separate subpoenas from the U.S. Department of Justice related to (i) the sales, marketing and regulatory matters related to the Stryker PainPump and (ii) sales, marketing and regulatory matters related to the OtisKnee device. The Company is in the process of responding to these subpoenas. In March 2010 a shareholder’s derivative action complaint against certain current and former Directors and Officers of the Company was filed in the United States District Court for the Western District of Michigan Southern Division. This lawsuit was brought by the Westchester Putnam Counties Heavy and Highway Laborers Local 60 Benefit Funds and Laborers Local 235 Benefit Funds. The complaint alleges claims for breach of fiduciary duties and gross mismanagement in connection with certain product recalls, FDA warning letters, government investigations relating to physician compensation and the criminal proceeding brought against the Company’s Biotech division. The case has been stayed while a Special Committee of the Board of Directors evaluates the claims. In January 2010 a purported class action lawsuit against the Company was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on behalf of those who purchased the Company’s common stock between January 25, 2007 and November 13, 2008, inclusive. The lawsuit seeks remedies under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. In May 2010 the lawsuit was transferred to the United States District Court for the Western District of Michigan Southern Division. The Company intends to defend itself vigorously. In 2009 a federal grand jury in the District of Massachusetts returned an indictment charging Stryker Biotech LLC and certain current and former employees of Stryker Biotech with wire fraud, conspiracy to defraud the FDA, distribution of a misbranded device and false statements to the FDA. The Company still hopes to be able to reach a fair and just resolution of this matter. The ultimate resolution of this matter is not reasonably estimable at this time, however, a conviction on the charges described above could result in significant monetary fines. Because Stryker Biotech is not presently involved in the sale of health care products and services (see additional information in Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), any conviction on these charges resulting in exclusion from participating in federal and state health care programs would not be expected to have a material effect on Stryker Biotech’s present business operations. Certain former Stryker Biotech employees have pled guilty to charges in connection with this matter. In 2009 the Company received a warning letter from the FDA related to compliance issues for one of its craniomaxillofacial (CMF) implant products that was previously sold through its CMF distribution facility in Portage, Michigan. In 2007 the Company received two warning letters from the FDA regarding compliance with certain quality system specifications at its reconstructive implant manufacturing facilities: one letter for its facility in Cork, Ireland and another for its facility in Mahwah, New Jersey. In March 2010 the FDA informed the Company that the warning letter related to its Mahwah manufacturing facility had been resolved following a re-inspection in 2009 and additional corrective actions. In May 2010 the FDA informed the Company that the 34 Table of Contents warning letters related to its Cork, Ireland and CMF facilities had been resolved following FDA re-inspection of the Cork, Ireland facility and additional corrective actions at both the Cork and CMF facilities. In 2007 the Company announced that it reached a resolution with the U.S. Attorney’s office for the District of New Jersey in connection with an investigation relating to “any and all consulting contracts, professional service agreements, or remuneration agreements between Stryker Corporation and any orthopedic surgeon, orthopedic surgeon in training, or medical school graduate using or considering the surgical use of hip or knee joint replacement/reconstruction products manufactured or sold by Stryker Corporation.” The resolution was in the form of a non-prosecution agreement, which included oversight by a federal monitor, for an 18-month period that ended on March 27, 2009. Subsequent to entering into the non-prosecution agreement, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Inspector General (HHS) issued a civil subpoena to the Company in seeking to determine whether the Company violated various laws by paying consulting fees and providing other things of value to orthopedic surgeons and healthcare and educational institutions as inducements to use Stryker’s orthopedic medical devices in procedures paid for in whole or in part by Medicare. The investigation is ongoing and the Company has produced numerous documents and other materials to HHS in response to the subpoena. In 2007 the Company disclosed that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) made an informal inquiry of the Company regarding possible violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in connection with the sale of medical devices in certain foreign countries. Subsequently, in 2008, the Company received a subpoena from the U.S. Department of Justice, Criminal Division, requesting certain documents for the period since January 1, 2000 in connection with the SEC inquiry. The Company is fully cooperating with the U.S. Department of Justice and the SEC regarding these matters. ITEM 7A.

310764,SYK,STRYKER CORP,2004,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Executive Level Overview Stryker Corporation (the ""Company"" or ""Stryker"") is a leader in the worldwide orthopaedic market and is one of the world's largest medical device companies. Stryker delivers results through a wide range of capabilities including joint replacements, trauma, spine and micro implant systems, orthobiologics, powered surgical instruments, surgical navigation systems and endoscopic products as well as patient handling and emergency medical equipment. Stryker also provides outpatient physical therapy services in the United States. The Company segregates its operations into two reportable business segments: Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment. The Orthopaedic Implants segment sells orthopaedic reconstructive (hip, knee and shoulder), trauma and spinal implants, bone cement and the bone growth factor osteogenic protein-1 (OP-1). The MedSurg Equipment segment sells powered surgical instruments, endoscopic products, hospital beds and stretchers and micro implant and surgical navigation systems. Other includes Physical Therapy Services and corporate administration, interest expense and interest income. Domestic sales accounted for 64% of total revenues in 2003. Most of the Company's products are marketed directly to more than 6,000 hospitals and to doctors and other health-care facilities by approximately 2,100 sales and marketing personnel in the United States. Stryker primarily maintains separate and dedicated sales forces for each of its principal product lines to provide focus and a high level of expertise to each medical specialty served. International sales accounted for 36% of total revenues in 2003. The Company's products are sold in more than 100 countries through more than 1,900 local dealers and direct sales efforts. Local dealer support and direct sales are coordinated by approximately 1,900 sales and marketing personnel. Stryker distributes its products through sales subsidiaries and branches with offices located in Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hong Kong, India, Italy, Japan, Korea, Mexico, The Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Singapore, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan and the United Kingdom. Stryker exports products to dealers and to customers in Africa, Bangladesh, China, the CIS (former Soviet Union), Cyprus, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Korea, Latin America, Malaysia, the Middle East, Philippines, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, Vietnam and Yugoslavia. The Company's business is generally not seasonal in nature; however, the number of orthopaedic implant surgeries is lower during the summer months. - 18 - Outlook for 2004 The Company's outlook for 2004 continues to be very optimistic regarding the markets it participates in and the underlying growth rates in orthopaedic procedures. The Company expects diluted net earnings per share for 2004 to approximate $2.68. The financial expectations for 2004 include net sales growth of approximately 16% as a result of strong growth in shipments of Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment, favorable foreign currency exchange rate movements and higher revenue from Physical Therapy Services. If foreign currency exchange rates hold at January 27, 2004 levels, the Company anticipates a favorable impact on net sales in the first quarter and full year of 2004 of approximately $45 million and $145 million, respectively. As the Company pays down outstanding borrowings under its Unsecured Credit Facilities and reduces the $150.0 million outstanding under its accounts receivable securitization facility, the Company expects to generate cash earnings in excess of its needs to fund future working capital requirements. The Company anticipates investing in future business growth, including business and product line acquisitions to supplement its current product offerings, instrumentation in support of new product launches and future building expansions, including manufacturing facility expansions for certain divisions within its MedSurg segment. Results of Operations The table below outlines the components of the consolidated statements of earnings as a percentage of net sales and the year-to-year percentage change in dollar amounts: Percentage of Net Sales Percentage Change 2003 2002 2001 2003/2002 2002/2001 Net sales 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% 20% 16% Cost of sales 36.2 36.9 37.0 18 15 Gross profit 63.8 63.1 63.0 22 16 Research, development and engineering expenses 5.0 4.7 5.5 27 -- Selling, general and administrative expenses 39.1 38.7 37.9 22 18 Restructuring and acquisition-related charges -- 0.6 -- (100) -- Other expense (income) 1.8 2.3 4.0 (8) (33) Earnings before income taxes and extraordinary item 18.0 16.8 15.6 29 25 Income taxes 5.5 5.3 5.1 24 20 Earnings before extraordinary item 12.5 11.5 10.4 31 27 Extraordinary loss, net of income taxes -- -- (0.2) -- -- Net earnings 12.5% 11.5% 10.3% 31 29 ==== ==== ==== - 19 - The table below sets forth domestic/international and product line sales information: Net Sales (in millions) Percentage Change 2003 2002 2001 2003/2002 2002/2001 Domestic/international sales Domestic $2,333.4 $1,973.7 $1,688.4 18% 17% International 1,291.9 1,037.9 913.9 24 14 Total net sales $3,625.3 $3,011.6 $2,602.3 20 16 ====== ====== ====== Product line sales Orthopaedic Implants $2,093.0 $1,704.8 $1,447.2 23 18 MedSurg Equipment 1,309.3 1,105.3 974.2 18 13 Physical Therapy Services 223.0 201.5 180.9 11 11 Total net sales $3,625.3 $3,011.6 $2,602.3 20 16 ====== ====== ====== 2003 Compared with 2002 Stryker Corporation's net sales increased 20% in 2003 to $3,625.3 million from $3,011.6 million in 2002. Net sales grew by 12% as a result of increased unit volume and changes in product mix; 2% related to higher selling prices; 5% due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates; and 1% as a result of acquired businesses. Domestic sales were $2,333.4 million for 2003, representing an increase of 18% as a result of strong shipments of Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment and higher revenue from Physical Therapy Services. International sales were $1,291.9 million for 2003, representing an increase of 24% as a result of higher shipments of Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment. The impact of foreign currency comparisons to the dollar value of international sales was favorable by $145.9 million for 2003. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, international sales increased 10% in 2003. Worldwide sales of Orthopaedic Implants were $2,093.0 million for 2003, representing an increase of 23% as a result of higher shipments of reconstructive, trauma and spinal implants. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, sales of Orthopaedic Implants increased 16% for the year. Worldwide sales of MedSurg Equipment were $1,309.3 million for 2003, representing an increase of 18% as a result of higher shipments of powered surgical instruments, endoscopic products, hospital beds and stretchers and micro implant and surgical navigation systems. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, sales of MedSurg Equipment increased 15% for the year. Physical Therapy Services revenues were $223.0 million for 2003, representing an increase of 11% as a result of new physical therapy centers and higher revenues from existing centers. Cost of sales represented 36.2% of sales compared with 36.9% in 2002. The lower cost of sales percentage in 2003 is due to the faster sales growth in the higher margin Orthopaedic Implants business and an increase in the absorption of fixed manufacturing costs caused by increased production at certain of the Company's manufacturing plants to meet current demand. Research, development and engineering expenses represented 5.0% of sales in 2003 compared to 4.7% in 2002. The higher spending level is the result of final development spending in advance of the Company's product launches in 2003 and continued focus on new product development for anticipated future product launches. New product introductions in 2003 included the Trident Ceramic Acetabular System, Simplex P with Tobramycin Bone Cement and the CORE platform of micro powered surgical instruments in the United States market and the System 5 heavy-duty, battery-powered surgical instruments in Europe. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 22% in 2003 and represented 39.1% of sales compared with 38.7% in 2002. The 22% increase in selling, general and administrative expenses is partially due to an increase in sales commission expense as a result of the 20% increase in net sales in 2003. In addition, the Company incurred a $14.0 million increase in insurance costs during 2003 resulting from increased premiums - 20 - charged by third-party insurers and a wholly owned captive insurance company established in 2003 as more fully described in Other Matters. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales in 2003 is primarily due to higher distribution costs associated with the increased sales mix of Orthopaedic Implants, increased amortization of loaner instrument sets, the increase in insurance costs and higher advertising costs associated with the Company's previously announced patient education campaign. The Company recognized charges of $17.2 million ($11.5 million net of income taxes) related to restructuring and acquisition-related items in the third quarter of 2002. The 2002 restructuring and acquisition-related items included a charge of $21.0 million ($14.1 million net of income taxes) for employment-related costs to close the Company's Rutherford, New Jersey, manufacturing facility, partially offset by a credit of $3.8 million ($2.6 million net of income taxes) to reverse certain Howmedica acquisition-related costs to reflect actual final payments required. See the following comparison of 2002 results to 2001 results for additional information. Interest expense declined to $22.6 million in 2003 from $40.3 million in 2002, primarily as a result of lower outstanding debt balances. The increase in intangibles amortization to $45.4 million in 2003 from $28.9 million in 2002 is primarily the result of the increased intangible assets recorded as a result of the July 1, 2002 acquisition of the Surgical Dynamics Inc. spinal implant business (SDI) from Tyco International Ltd. as more fully described in Other Matters. In addition, the Company recorded a $6.5 million charge related to a trademark impairment resulting from a branding initiative adopted by the Company in the fourth quarter of 2003. The branding initiative is intended to improve the Company's customers' and other stakeholders' overall awareness of Stryker's capabilities. The charge is included in intangibles amortization in the consolidated statements of earnings. Other income was $3.8 million in 2003, compared with $0.5 million of other expense in 2002 due to foreign currency transaction gains in the current year compared to losses in the prior year and higher interest income. The effective income tax rate was 30.5% in 2003 compared with 31.8% in 2002. The Company's effective income tax rate for 2003 was reduced primarily as a result of increased manufacturing in lower tax jurisdictions such as Ireland and Puerto Rico. Net earnings increased 31% to $453.5 million from $345.6 million in 2002; basic net earnings per share increased 30% to $2.28 in 2003 from $1.75 in 2002; and diluted net earnings per share increased 31% to $2.23 in 2003 from $1.70 in 2002. Excluding the impact of the restructuring and acquisition-related items for the year ended December 31, 2002 adjusted net earnings increased 27% from $357.1 million in 2002 to $453.5 million in 2003. Adjusted basic net earnings per share increased 26% from $1.81 in 2002 to $2.28 in 2003. Adjusted diluted net earnings per share increased 27% from $1.75 in 2002 to $2.23 in 2003. These adjusted non-GAAP financial measures do not replace the presentation of the Company's GAAP financial results. The Company has provided this supplemental non-GAAP information because it provides meaningful information regarding the Company's results on a consistent and comparable basis for the periods presented. Management uses this non-GAAP financial information for reviewing the operating results of its business segments and for analyzing potential future business trends in connection with its budget process. In addition, the Company believes investors utilize this information to evaluate period-to-period results and to understand potential future operating results. The Company believes that the economic nature of the restructuring charge and the acquisition-related credit are sufficiently unique that similar items have not been recorded in the prior two fiscal years nor are they reasonably likely to recur within two years. In addition, the Company reasonably believes that it is probable that the financial impact of each of these individual items will become insignificant by the end of 2004. The Company encourages investors and other users of these financial statements to review its Consolidated Financial Statements and other publicly filed reports in their entirety and to not rely solely on any single financial measure. The reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures are as follows (in millions): - 21 - 2003 2002 % Change Reported net earnings $453.5 $345.6 31% Restructuring charge -- 14.1 -- Acquisition-related credit -- (2.6) -- Adjusted net earnings $453.5 $357.1 27 ==== ==== Basic net earnings per share: Reported basic net earnings per share $2.28 $1.75 30 Restructuring charge -- $.07 -- Acquisition-related credit -- ($.01) -- Adjusted basic net earnings per share $2.28 $1.81 26 Diluted net earnings per share: Reported diluted net earnings per share $2.23 $1.70 31 Restructuring charge -- $.07 -- Acquisition-related credit -- ($.01) -- Adjusted diluted net earnings per share $2.23 $1.75 27 2002 Compared with 2001 Stryker Corporation's net sales increased 16% in 2002 to $3,011.6 million from $2,602.3 million in 2001. Net sales grew by 11% as a result of increased unit volume and changes in product mix; 3% related to higher selling prices; and 2% as a result of acquired businesses. Domestic sales were $1,973.7 million for 2002, representing an increase of 17% as a result of strong shipments of Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment and higher revenue from Physical Therapy Services. The July 1, 2002, acquisition of SDI added $22.8 million to domestic sales for 2002. International sales were $1,037.9 million for 2002, representing an increase of 14% as a result of higher shipments of Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment. The acquisition of SDI added $2.5 million to international sales for 2002. The impact of foreign currency comparisons to the dollar value of international sales was favorable by $13.7 million for 2002. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, international sales increased 12% in 2002. Worldwide sales of Orthopaedic Implants were $1,704.8 million for 2002, representing an increase of 18% as a result of higher shipments of reconstructive, trauma and spinal implants. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, sales of Orthopaedic Implants increased 17% for the year. Worldwide sales of MedSurg Equipment were $1,105.3 million for 2002, representing an increase of 13% as a result of higher shipments of powered surgical instruments, endoscopic products, hospital beds and stretchers and micro implant and surgical navigation systems. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, sales of MedSurg Equipment increased 13% for the year. Physical Therapy Services revenues were $201.5 million for 2002, representing an increase of 11% as a result of new physical therapy centers and higher revenues from existing centers. Cost of sales represented 36.9% of sales compared with 37.0% in 2001. The slightly lower cost of sales percentage in 2002 was due to an increase in the absorption of fixed manufacturing costs caused by increased production at certain of the Company's manufacturing plants to meet current demand and higher sales growth for the higher margin Orthopaedic Implant products, offset partially by higher product obsolescence resulting from product launches. While research, development and engineering expenses in 2002 were consistent with prior year amounts, they decreased to 4.7% of sales from 5.5% in 2001. Research, development and engineering spending was affected in 2002 by the commercial launch of OP-1, which occurred in various markets in the second and fourth quarters of 2001. Following the launch, in 2002 Stryker Biotech recorded a portion of its expenses as cost of sales and selling, general and administrative expenses, compared with 2001, when this division classified substantially all of its costs as research, development and engineering. Increased spending from the Company's continued focus on new product development partially offset the decreased research, development and engineering expenses related to Stryker Biotech. New product introductions in 2002 included ScorpioFlex knee - 22 - for the United States market, Super Secur-Fit Plus hip for the Japanese market, Trident Ceramic Acetabular System in Canada, Xia II Spinal System, System 5 heavy-duty, battery-powered surgical instruments, TPS Saber Drill, SDC Pro 2 surgical DVD documentation system, PainPump2, Precision System for percutaneous cement delivery, fluoroscopic software module for the Stryker Navigation System and Go Bed +. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 18% in 2002 and represented 38.7% of sales compared with 37.9% in 2001. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was partially due to an increase in sales commission expense as a result of the 16% increase in net sales in 2002. In addition, the Company incurred an $8.9 million increase in insurance costs during 2002. The change in classification of certain Stryker Biotech expenses, as discussed above, also contributed to the increase in selling, general and administrative expenses. Discount expense related to the accounts receivable securitization facility, which was included in selling, general and administrative expenses, declined to $2.7 million in 2002 from $5.8 million in 2001 as a result of lower discount rates. The Company recognized charges of $17.2 million ($11.5 million net of income taxes) related to restructuring and acquisition-related items in the third quarter of 2002. The 2002 restructuring and acquisition-related items included a charge of $21.0 million ($14.1 million net of income taxes) for employment-related costs to close the Company's Rutherford, New Jersey, manufacturing facility, partially offset by a credit of $3.8 million ($2.6 million net of income taxes) to reverse certain Howmedica acquisition-related costs to reflect actual final payments required. The $21.0 million restructuring charge related primarily to a shutdown agreement reached between the Company and the employee bargaining unit to close the Orthopaedics division implant manufacturing facility in Rutherford, New Jersey, which was ratified by the members of the I.U.E.-CWA Local 485 on August 23, 2002. The charge covered employment-related severance costs for 353 employees. The Rutherford facility was closed during 2003 with final severance payments to be made by the end of 2005. The Orthopaedics division has completed the transition of production to its facilities in Mahwah, New Jersey, as well as Cork and Limerick, Ireland. In the fourth quarter of 2001, the Company recognized charges of $0.6 million related to various restructuring and acquisition-related events. The 2001 restructuring and acquisition-related charges included $2.4 million of charges, partially offset by the reversal of prior year restructuring accruals totaling $1.8 million. Interest expense declined to $40.3 million in 2002 from $67.9 million in 2001, primarily as a result of lower outstanding debt balances. The decrease in intangibles amortization to $28.9 million in 2002 from $38.4 million in 2001 was primarily the result of the Company's adoption of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, which prohibits the amortization of goodwill. If the nonamortization provisions of Statement No. 142 had been applied in the prior year, amortization expense for 2001 would have been reduced by $18.1 million and net earnings would have increased by $12.1 million ($.06 per diluted share). Other expense was $0.5 million in 2002, compared with $1.6 million of other income in 2001 due to foreign currency transaction losses in the current year versus gains in the prior year, partially offset by higher interest income. The effective income tax rate was 31.8% in 2002 compared with 33.0% in 2001. The Company's effective income tax rate for 2002 was reduced from 33.0% to 31.8% in the fourth quarter of 2002, thereby reducing income tax expense by $6.1 million, primarily as a result of increased manufacturing in lower tax jurisdictions such as Ireland and Puerto Rico. Earnings before extraordinary item increased 27% to $345.6 million from $271.8 million in 2001; basic earnings per share before extraordinary item increased 27% to $1.75 in 2002 from $1.38 in 2001; and diluted earnings per share before extraordinary item increased 27% to $1.70 in 2002 from $1.34 in 2001. In December 2001, the Company refinanced and prepaid the remaining $642.7 million outstanding under the $1,650.0 million Senior Secured Credit Facilities established in 1998 in connection with the Howmedica acquisition. The prepayment of the 1998 Facilities resulted in the write-off in 2001 of related unamortized deferred loan costs of $7.1 million, which was reflected as an extraordinary loss of $4.8 million (net of income taxes of $2.3 million; $.02 per basic and diluted share). Net earnings were $345.6 million (basic and diluted net earnings per share of $1.75 and $1.70, respectively) compared with $267.0 million (basic and diluted net earnings per share of $1.36 and $1.32, respectively) in 2001. - 23 - Excluding the impact of the restructuring and acquisition-related items on 2002 and 2001 and the impact of the change in goodwill amortization and the extraordinary item on 2001, adjusted net earnings in 2002 were $357.1 million, representing a 26% increase over adjusted net earnings of $284.3 million in 2001. Adjusted basic net earnings per share increased 25% to $1.81 compared with $1.45 in 2001. Adjusted diluted net earnings per share increased 25% to $1.75 compared with $1.40 in 2001.

The reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures are as follows (in millions): 2002 2001 % Change Reported net earnings $345.6 $267.0 29% Restructuring charge/(credit) 14.1 (0.2) -- Acquisition-related charge/(credit) (2.6) 0.6 -- Goodwill and assembled workforce amortization -- 12.1 -- Extraordinary loss -- 4.8 -- Adjusted net earnings $357.1 $284.3 26 ==== ==== Basic net earnings per share: Reported basic net earnings per share $1.75 $1.36 29 Restructuring charge/(credit) $.07 -- -- Acquisition-related charge/(credit) ($.01) -- -- Goodwill and assembled workforce amortization -- $.06 -- Extraordinary loss -- $.02 -- Adjusted basic net earnings per share $1.81 $1.45 25 Diluted net earnings per share: Reported diluted net earnings per share $1.70 $1.32 29 Restructuring charge/(credit) $.07 -- -- Acquisition-related charge/(credit) ($.01) -- -- Goodwill and assembled workforce amortization -- $.06 -- Extraordinary loss -- $.02 -- Adjusted diluted net earnings per share $1.75 $1.40 25 Liquidity and Capital Resources The Company's working capital at December 31, 2003 increased $103.3 million to $547.1 million from $443.8 million at December 31, 2002, including the effect of the proceeds from the sale of an additional $20.0 million of accounts receivable pursuant to the accounts receivable securitization facility, that were used to reduce outstanding borrowings under the Company's Unsecured Credit Facilities. The increase in working capital resulted from growth in the Company's overall business and the use of strong earnings to fund increases in accounts receivable, inventory and prepaid expenses and to pay current liabilities due in 2003, primarily for - 24 - income taxes and restructuring and acquisition-related liabilities. Trade accounts payable and other accrued liabilities increased in 2003 as a result of the growth in the business, higher obligations for third-party sales agent commissions, third-party royalties, non-income based taxes, increased reserves for legal claims and assessments and increases in other accrued liabilities. Accounts receivable days sales outstanding, excluding the effect of $150.0 million outstanding under the Company's $200.0 million accounts receivable securitization facility, of 58 days was unchanged at December 31, 2003 compared to December 31, 2002. Days sales in inventory decreased 6 days to 120 days at December 31, 2003 from 126 days at December 31, 2002. The lower days sales in inventory is primarily the result of improved inventory management and higher provisions for product obsolescence as a result of product launches. The Company generated cash of $648.5 million from operations in 2003 compared with $516.2 million in 2002. The generation of cash in 2003 is the result of strong cash earnings (net earnings plus noncash adjustments) and increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses. These items were partially offset by increases in deferred charges and accounts receivable from increased sales and payments of $15.5 million attributable to restructuring and acquisition-related liabilities and acquisition purchase liabilities. In 2003, the Company used cash of $10.8 million for business and product line acquisitions, $144.5 million for capital expenditures and $23.7 million for the payment of dividends. In addition to the borrowings used to fund business and product line acquisitions, the Company borrowed an additional $664.5 million under its existing credit facilities to fund cash flow needs during 2003 and made repayments of $1,144.6 million against the credit facilities. Total borrowings declined by $475.6 million after adjusting for the effect of foreign currency translation. In 2003, the Company used cash of $144.5 million for capital expenditures, including $27.7 million related to the construction of Phase II of the Company's Mahwah, New Jersey, manufacturing and distribution facility. In addition, the Company spent $4.6 million for the expansion of the Company's manufacturing facility in West Lebanon, New Hampshire, and $3.8 million for the expansion of the Company's Cork, Ireland, manufacturing facility. The Company had $65.9 million in cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2003. The Company also had outstanding borrowings totaling $26.1 million at that date. Current maturities of long-term debt at December 31, 2003 are $7.3 million and will increase to $15.6 million in 2006. The Company's $750.0 million five-year, nonamortizing, revolving credit agreement expires in December 2006. As a result of current cash and outstanding debt balances, the Company decided not to renew its previously existing $250.0 million 364-day revolving credit agreement which expired in December 2003. The Company believes its cash on hand, as well as anticipated cash flows from operations, will be sufficient to fund future operating capital requirements, future manufacturing facility construction and other capital expenditures, future business and product line acquisitions and required debt repayments. Should additional funds be required, the Company had $802.1 million of additional borrowing capacity available under all of its existing credit facilities and an additional $50.0 million of eligible accounts receivable which could be sold through its accounts receivable securitization facility at December 31, 2003. The Company's future contractual obligations for agreements with initial terms greater than one year, including agreements to purchase materials in the normal course of business, are summarized as follows (in millions): Payment Period 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 Thereafter Long-term debt $7.3 $0.0 $15.6 $0.0 $0.0 $3.2 Operating leases 43.7 34.8 26.4 20.5 16.9 49.3 Unconditional purchase obligations 162.5 0.7 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 - 25 - The Company's additional borrowing capacity, along with the expected expiration period of the commitment, are summarized as follows (in millions): Amount of Commitment Total Expiration Per Period Amount Less than In excess of Committed 1 year 1 year Lines of credit $785.3 $68.9 $716.4 Standby letters of credit 16.8 4.5 12.3 $802.1 $73.4 $728.7 Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates these estimates. Estimates are based on historical experience, when available, and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Management believes that an understanding of the following critical accounting policies is important in obtaining an overall understanding of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses in the collection of accounts receivable. The Company makes estimates regarding the future ability of its customers to make required payments based on historical credit experience and expected future trends. If actual customer financial conditions are less favorable than projected by management, additional accounts receivable write-offs may be necessary, which could unfavorably affect future operating results. Inventory Reserves The Company maintains reserves for excess and obsolete inventory resulting from the potential inability to sell its products at prices in excess of current carrying costs. The markets in which the Company operates are highly competitive, with new products and surgical procedures introduced on an ongoing basis. Such marketplace changes may cause the Company's products to become obsolete. The Company makes estimates regarding the future recoverability of the costs of these products and records a provision for excess and obsolete inventories based on historical experience, expiration of sterilization dates and expected future trends. If actual product life cycles, product demand or acceptance of new product introductions are less favorable than projected by management, additional inventory write-downs may be required, which could unfavorably affect future operating results. Income TaxesThe Company operates in multiple tax jurisdictions both inside and outside the United States. Accordingly, management must determine the appropriate allocation of income to each of these jurisdictions. Tax audits associated with the allocation of this income and other complex issues may require an extended period of time to resolve and may result in income tax adjustments if changes to the income allocation are required between jurisdictions with different tax rates. Because tax adjustments in certain jurisdictions can be significant, the - 26 - Company records accruals representing management's best estimate of the probable resolution of these matters. To the extent additional information becomes available, such accruals are adjusted to reflect the revised estimated probable outcome. Other Matters The Company distributes its products throughout the world. As a result, the Company's financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets. The Company's operating results are primarily exposed to changes in exchange rates among the United States dollar and the Japanese yen and European currencies, in particular the euro and the British pound. When the United States dollar weakens against foreign currencies, the dollar value of sales denominated in foreign currencies increases. When the United States dollar strengthens, the opposite situation occurs. The Company manufactures its products in the United States, France, Germany, Ireland, Switzerland, Canada and Puerto Rico and incurs the costs to manufacture in the applicable local currencies. This worldwide deployment of factories serves to partially mitigate the impact of currency exchange rate changes on the Company's cost of sales. The Company follows the provisions of FASB Statement No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended by Statements No. 137 and No. 138, in accounting for its derivative financial instruments. The Statements require the Company to recognize all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value. Derivatives that are not documented and accounted for as hedges must be adjusted to fair value through earnings. If a derivative is a hedge, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in the fair value of the derivative are either offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets, liabilities or firm commitments through earnings or recognized in accumulated other comprehensive gain (loss) until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. The Company enters into forward currency exchange contracts to mitigate the impact of currency fluctuations on transactions denominated in nonfunctional currencies, thereby limiting risk to the Company that would otherwise result from changes in exchange rates. These nonfunctional currency exposures principally relate to intercompany payables arising from intercompany purchases of manufactured products. The periods of the forward currency exchange contracts correspond to the periods of the exposed transactions, with realized gains and losses included in the measurement and recording of transactions denominated in the nonfunctional currencies. At December 31, 2003, the Company had outstanding forward currency exchange contracts to purchase $123.9 million and sell $154.9 million of various currencies (principally United States dollars and euros) with maturities ranging principally from 30 to 180 days. At December 31, 2002, the Company had outstanding forward currency exchange contracts to purchase $82.0 million and sell $97.7 million of various currencies (principally United States dollars and euros) with maturities ranging principally from 30 to 180 days. The estimated fair value of forward currency exchange contracts represents the measurement of the contracts at month-end spot rates as adjusted by current forward points. A hypothetical 10% change in exchange rates for these currencies would change the 2003 fair value by approximately $2.1 million and would have changed the 2002 fair value by approximately $0.5 million. At December 31, 2003, the Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties on its outstanding forward currency exchange contracts but does not anticipate nonperformance by any of the counterparties. The Company is exposed to market risk for changes in interest rates as a result of its borrowings and the accounts receivable securitization facility. The Company managed a portion of its interest rate risk on its borrowings through interest rate swap agreements, which had fixed the base rate on a $250.0 million notional amount of the variable-rate borrowings during 2003. These interest rate swap agreements expired during 2003. If market interest rates for similar borrowings had averaged 1% more than they did in 2003, the Company's 2003 - 27 - interest expense, after considering the effects of its interest rate swaps, would have increased, and earnings before income taxes would have decreased, by $0.7 million. By comparison, if market interest rates had averaged 1% less than they did during 2003, the Company's 2003 interest expense, after considering the effects of its interest rate swaps, would have decreased, and earnings before income taxes would have increased, by $0.7 million. If market interest rates for the accounts receivable securitization facility had averaged 1% more than they did in 2003, the Company's discount expense would have increased, and earnings before income taxes would have decreased, by $1.7 million. By comparison, if market interest rates had averaged 1% less than they did in 2003, the Company's discount expense would have decreased, and earnings before income taxes would have increased, by $1.7 million. These amounts are determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on the Company's borrowing cost, interest rate swap agreements and accounts receivable securitization facility without any actions by management to mitigate its exposure to such changes. The Company's interest rate swap agreements, which matured over various terms ranging from September 2003 through December 2003, effectively converted a portion of its variable-rate borrowings to a fixed-rate basis, thus reducing the impact of changes in interest rates on interest expense. The Company designated the interest rate swap agreements as cash flow hedges. Gains of $9.2 million and $9.3 million and a loss of $22.0 million attributable to changes in the fair value of interest rate swap agreements were recorded as components of accumulated other comprehensive gain (loss) in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Interest rate differentials paid or received as a result of interest rate swaps were recognized as an adjustment of interest expense related to the designated borrowings. The Company has used yen-denominated floating-rate borrowings to protect a portion of the value of its investment in its subsidiary in Japan. Realized and unrealized gains and losses from this hedge were not included in the consolidated statements of earnings, but were recorded as foreign currency translation adjustments within accumulated other comprehensive gain (loss) in stockholders' equity. Net gains (losses) of ($2.1) million, ($1.6) million and $5.8 million attributable to the yen-denominated floating-rate borrowings hedge were recorded as foreign currency translation adjustments in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The Company has certain investments in net assets in international locations that are not hedged. These investments are subject to translation gains and losses due to changes in foreign currencies. For the year ended December 31, 2003, the strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar increased the value of these investments in net assets by $176.3 million. This gain eliminated the previously recorded cumulative loss of $68.6 million that had been deferred and recorded as a separate component of stockholders' equity at December 31, 2002. On July 1, 2002, the Company acquired SDI from Tyco International Ltd., for $135.0 million in cash. The acquisition expanded the Company's spinal product line by adding interbody spinal cages for the United States market as well as other thoracolumbar and cervical spinal fixation devices. The acquisition was funded using existing credit facilities. The acquisition of SDI was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. The results of operations for the acquired business are included in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements beginning July 1, 2002. The Company's pro forma consolidated financial results in 2002 did not differ significantly as a result of the SDI acquisition. The Company is partially self-insured for product liability claims. In 2003, the Company established a wholly owned captive insurance company in the U.S. to manage its self-insured retention limits. The captive insurance company provides insurance reserves for estimated liabilities for product claims incurred but not reported based on actuarially determined liabilities. The actuarial valuations are based on historical information along with certain assumptions about future events. During the second quarter of 2003, the Company issued 50,000 shares of restricted stock to its newly appointed President and Chief Operating Officer. The stock vests ratably on the first five anniversary dates of the grant, provided that the recipient is still employed by the Company. The aggregate market value of the restricted stock at the date of issuance of $3.4 million, as measured at the quoted price of the Company's common stock, has been recorded as deferred stock-based compensation, a separate component of stockholders' equity, and is being amortized over the five-year vesting period. - 28 - In December 2003, the Company announced that its subsidiary, Physiotherapy Associates, Inc., and Stryker received a subpoena from the United States Attorney's Office in Boston, Massachusetts, in connection with a Department of Justice investigation of Physiotherapy Associates' billing and coding practices. Physiotherapy Associates provides physical, occupational and speech therapy services to patients through 374 outpatient centers in the United States and represented 6% and 7% of Stryker's net sales for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively Revenues derived from billings to U.S. Federal health-care programs approximated 14% of Physiotherapy Associates' revenues during these periods. The Company is fully cooperating with the Department of Justice regarding this matter. In December 2003, the FASB issued a revision to Statement No. 132, Employers' Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits. This revision requires additional disclosures by the Company regarding its plan assets, investment strategies, plan obligations and cash flows. The Company has adopted these new disclosure requirements for all of its defined benefit plans. ITEM 7A.
