The primary businesses of the Southern Company system are electricity sales by the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power and the distribution of natural gas by Southern Company Gas.•The traditional electric operating companies are vertically integrated utilities providing electric service in three Southeastern states as of January 1, 2019. On January 1, 2019, Southern Company completed its sale of Gulf Power to NextEra Energy for an aggregate cash purchase price of approximately $5.8 billion (less $1.3 billion of indebtedness assumed), subject to customary working capital adjustments. At December 31, 2018, the assets and liabilities of Gulf Power were classified as held for sale on Southern Company's balance sheet. Unless otherwise noted, the disclosures herein related to specific asset and liability balances at December 31, 2018 exclude assets and liabilities held for sale. See Note 15 under ""Assets Held for Sale"" for additional information. A preliminary gain of $2.5 billion pre-tax ($1.3 billion after tax) associated with the sale of Gulf Power is expected to be recorded in 2019.•Southern Power develops, constructs, acquires, owns, and manages power generation assets, including renewable energy projects, and sells electricity at market-based rates in the wholesale market. On May 22, 2018, Southern Power sold a noncontrolling 33% equity interest in SP Solar, a limited partnership indirectly owning substantially all of Southern Power's solar facilities, for approximately $1.2 billion and, on December 11, 2018, Southern Power sold a noncontrolling tax equity interest in SP Wind, a holding company owning a portfolio of eight operating wind facilities, for approximately $1.2 billion. On November 5, 2018, Southern Power entered into an agreement to sell all of its equity interests in Plant Mankato (including the 385-MW expansion currently under construction) for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $650 million, which is expected to close mid-2019. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.•Southern Company Gas distributes natural gas through its natural gas distribution utilities and is involved in several other complementary businesses including gas pipeline investments, wholesale gas services, and gas marketing services. In July 2018, Southern Company Gas completed sales of three of its natural gas distribution utilities.See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – ""General"" herein and Note 15 to the financial statements for additional information regarding disposition activities.Many factors affect the opportunities, challenges, and risks of the Southern Company system's electricity and natural gas businesses. These factors include the ability to maintain constructive regulatory environments, to maintain and grow sales and customers, and to effectively manage and secure timely recovery of costs. These costs include those related to projected long-term demand growth, stringent environmental standards, including CCR rules, reliability, fuel, restoration following major storms, and capital expenditures, including constructing new electric generating plants, expanding and improving the electric transmission and distribution systems, and updating and expanding the natural gas distribution systems.The traditional electric operating companies and natural gas distribution utilities have various regulatory mechanisms that operate to address cost recovery. Effectively operating pursuant to these regulatory mechanisms and appropriately balancing required costs and capital expenditures with customer prices will continue to challenge the Southern Company system for the foreseeable future. See Note 2 to the financial statements for additional information.In 2018, Alabama Power, Georgia Power, Mississippi Power, Atlanta Gas Light, and Nicor Gas reached agreements with their respective state PSCs or other applicable state regulatory agencies relating to the regulatory impacts of the Tax Reform Legislation, which, for some companies, included capital structure adjustments expected to help mitigate the potential adverse impacts to certain of their credit metrics. See Note 2 to the financial statements for additional information regarding state PSC or other regulatory agency actions related to the Tax Reform Legislation. Also see MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS – FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – ""Income Tax Matters"" and FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY – ""Credit Rating Risk"" herein and Note 10 to the financial statements for information regarding the Tax Reform Legislation.Another major factor affecting the Southern Company system's businesses is the profitability of the competitive market-based wholesale generating business. Southern Power's strategy is to create value through various transactions including acquisitions, dispositions, and sales of partnership interests, development and construction of new generating facilities, and entry into PPAs primarily with investor-owned utilities, IPPs, municipalities, electric cooperatives, and other load-serving entities, as well as commercial and industrial customers. In general, Southern Power commits to the construction or acquisition of new generating capacity only after entering into or assuming long-term PPAs for the new facilities.II-16 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual ReportSouthern Company's other business activities include providing energy solutions, including distributed energy infrastructure, energy efficiency products and services, and utility infrastructure services, to customers. Other business activities also include investments in telecommunications, leveraged lease projects, and gas storage facilities. Management continues to evaluate the contribution of each of these activities to total shareholder return and may pursue acquisitions, dispositions, and other strategic ventures or investments accordingly.In striving to achieve attractive risk-adjusted returns while providing cost-effective energy to more than eight million electric and gas utility customers, the Southern Company system continues to focus on several key performance indicators. These indicators include, but are not limited to, customer satisfaction, plant availability, electric and natural gas system reliability, execution of major construction projects, and earnings per share (EPS). Southern Company's financial success is directly tied to customer satisfaction. Key elements of ensuring customer satisfaction include outstanding service, high reliability, and competitive prices. Management uses customer satisfaction surveys and reliability indicators to evaluate the results of the Southern Company system.See RESULTS OF OPERATIONS herein for information on Southern Company's financial performance.Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 StatusIn 2009, the Georgia PSC certified construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 (with electric generating capacity of approximately 1,100 MWs each). Georgia Power holds a 45.7% ownership interest in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. In March 2017, the EPC Contractor filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. In December 2017, the Georgia PSC approved Georgia Power's recommendation to continue construction. The current expected in-service dates remain November 2021 for Unit 3 and November 2022 for Unit 4.In the second quarter 2018, Georgia Power revised its base capital cost forecast and estimated contingency to complete construction and start-up of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 to $8.0 billion and $0.4 billion, respectively, for a total project capital cost forecast of $8.4 billion (net of $1.7 billion received under the Guarantee Settlement Agreement and approximately $188 million in related Customer Refunds), with respect to Georgia Power's ownership interest. Although Georgia Power believes these incremental costs are reasonable and necessary to complete the project and the Georgia PSC's order in the seventeenth VCM proceeding specifically states that the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 is not subject to a cost cap, Georgia Power did not seek rate recovery for the $0.7 billion increase in costs included in the current base capital cost forecast (or any related financing costs) in the nineteenth VCM report that was approved by the Georgia PSC on February 19, 2019. In connection with future VCM filings, Georgia Power may request the Georgia PSC to evaluate costs currently included in the construction contingency estimate for rate recovery as and when they are appropriately included in the base capital cost forecast. After considering the significant level of uncertainty that exists regarding the future recoverability of costs included in the construction contingency estimate since the ultimate outcome of these matters is subject to the outcome of future assessments by management, as well as Georgia PSC decisions in these future regulatory proceedings, Georgia Power recorded a total pre-tax charge to income of $1.1 billion ($0.8 billion after tax) in the second quarter 2018.As a result of the increase in the total project capital cost forecast and Georgia Power's decision not to seek rate recovery of the increase in the base capital costs, the holders of at least 90% of the ownership interests in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 were required to vote to continue construction. On September 26, 2018, the Vogtle Owners unanimously voted to continue construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. In connection with the vote to continue construction, Georgia Power entered into (i) a binding term sheet (Vogtle Owner Term Sheet) with the other Vogtle Owners and certain of MEAG's wholly-owned subsidiaries, including MEAG Power SPVJ, LLC (MEAG SPVJ), to take certain actions which partially mitigate potential financial exposure for the other Vogtle Owners and (ii) a term sheet (MEAG Term Sheet) with MEAG and MEAG SPVJ to provide funding with respect to MEAG SPVJ's ownership interest in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 under certain circumstances. On January 14, 2019, Georgia Power, MEAG, and MEAG SPVJ entered into an agreement to implement the provisions of the MEAG Term Sheet. On February 18, 2019, Georgia Power, the other Vogtle Owners, and certain of MEAG's wholly-owned subsidiaries entered into certain amendments to their joint ownership agreements to implement the provisions of the Vogtle Owner Term Sheet.The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – ""Construction Program – Nuclear Construction"" herein for additional information on Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4.EarningsConsolidated net income attributable to Southern Company was $2.2 billion in 2018, an increase of $1.4 billion, or 164.4%, from the prior year. The increase was primarily due to charges of $3.4 billion ($2.4 billion after tax) in 2017 related to the Kemper IGCC at Mississippi Power, partially offset by a $1.1 billion ($0.8 billion after tax) charge in the second quarter 2018 for an II-17 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual Reportestimated probable loss on Georgia Power's construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. The increase also reflects lower federal income tax expense as a result of the Tax Reform Legislation, partially offset by impairment charges, primarily associated with asset sales at Southern Power and Southern Company Gas.Consolidated net income attributable to Southern Company was $842 million in 2017, a decrease of $1.6 billion, or 65.6%, from the prior year. The decrease was primarily due to pre-tax charges of $3.4 billion ($2.4 billion after tax) related to the Kemper IGCC at Mississippi Power. Also contributing to the change were increases of $240 million in net income from Southern Company Gas (excluding the impact of $111 million in additional expense related to the Tax Reform Legislation) reflecting the 12-month period in 2017 compared to the six-month period following the Merger closing on July 1, 2016, $264 million related to net tax benefits from the Tax Reform Legislation, higher retail electric revenues resulting from increases in base rates partially offset by milder weather and lower customer usage, and increases in renewable energy sales at Southern Power. These increases were partially offset by higher interest and depreciation and amortization.See Note 15 to the financial statements under ""Southern Company Merger with Southern Company Gas"" for additional information regarding the Merger.Basic EPS was $2.18 in 2018, $0.84 in 2017, and $2.57 in 2016. Diluted EPS, which factors in additional shares related to stock-based compensation, was $2.17 in 2018, $0.84 in 2017, and $2.55 in 2016. EPS for 2018, 2017, and 2016 was negatively impacted by $0.04, $0.04, and $0.12 per share, respectively, as a result of increases in the average shares outstanding.

Dividends paid per share of common stock were $2.38 in 2018, $2.30 in 2017, and $2.22 in 2016. In January 2019, Southern Company declared a quarterly dividend of 60 cents per share. This is the 285th consecutive quarter that Southern Company has paid a dividend equal to or higher than the previous quarter. For 2018, the dividend payout ratio was 109% compared to 273% for 2017. The decrease was due to an increase in earnings in 2018 resulting from charges related to the Kemper IGCC in 2017, partially offset by the charge related to construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 in 2018. See ""Earnings"" and RESULTS OF OPERATIONS – ""Electricity Business – Estimated Loss on Projects Under Construction"" herein and Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Georgia Power – Nuclear Construction"" and ""Mississippi Power – Kemper County Energy Facility"" for additional information.RESULTS OF OPERATIONSDiscussion of the results of operations is divided into three parts – the Southern Company system's primary business of electricity sales, its gas business, and its other business activities. 2018 2017 2016 (in millions)Electricity business$2,304 $878 $2,571Gas business372 243 114Other business activities(450) (279) (237)Net Income$2,226 $842 $2,448II-18 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual ReportElectricity BusinessSouthern Company's electric utilities generate and sell electricity to retail and wholesale customers.

Details of electric operating revenues were as follows: 2018 2017 (in millions)Retail electric — prior year$15,330 $15,234Estimated change resulting from — Rates and pricing(773) 508Sales growth (decline)84 (71)Weather300 (281)Fuel and other cost recovery281 (60)Retail electric — current year15,222 15,330Wholesale electric revenues2,516 2,426Other electric revenues664 681Other revenues169 103Electric operating revenues$18,571 $18,540Percent change0.2% 3.3%Retail electric revenues decreased $108 million, or 0.7%, in 2018 as compared to the prior year. The significant factors driving this change are shown in the preceding table. The decrease in rates and pricing in 2018 was primarily due to revenues deferred as regulatory liabilities for customer bill credits related to the Tax Reform Legislation and expected customer refunds at Alabama Power and Georgia Power.Retail electric revenues increased $96 million, or 0.6%, in 2017 as compared to the prior year. The significant factors driving this change are shown in the preceding table. The increase in rates and pricing in 2017 was primarily due to a Rate RSE increase at Alabama Power effective in January 2017, the recovery of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 construction financing costs under the NCCR tariff at Georgia Power, and an increase in retail base rates effective July 2017 at Gulf Power.See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Southern Company – Gulf Power,"" ""Alabama Power – Rate RSE"" and "" – Rate CNP Compliance,"" ""Georgia Power – Rate Plans,"" and "" – Nuclear Construction"" for additional information. Also see ""Energy Sales"" below for a discussion of changes in the volume of energy sold, including changes related to sales growth (decline) and weather.Electric rates for the traditional electric operating companies include provisions to adjust billings for fluctuations in fuel costs, including the energy component of purchased power costs. Under these provisions, fuel revenues generally equal fuel expenses, including the energy component of PPA costs, and do not affect net income. The traditional electric operating companies each have one or more regulatory mechanisms to recover other costs such as environmental and other compliance costs, storm damage, new plants, and PPA capacity costs.Wholesale electric revenues consist of PPAs and short-term opportunity sales. Wholesale electric revenues from PPAs (other than solar and wind PPAs) have both capacity and energy components. Capacity revenues generally represent the greatest contribution to net income and are designed to provide recovery of fixed costs plus a return on investment. Energy revenues will vary depending on fuel prices, the market prices of wholesale energy compared to the Southern Company system's generation, demand for energy within the Southern Company system's electric service territory, and the availability of the Southern Company system's generation. Increases and decreases in energy revenues that are driven by fuel prices are accompanied by an increase or decrease in fuel costs and do not have a significant impact on net income. Energy sales from solar and wind PPAs do not have a capacity charge and customers either purchase the energy output of a dedicated renewable facility through an energy charge or through a fixed price related to the energy. As a result, the ability to recover fixed and variable operations and maintenance expenses is dependent upon the level of energy generated from these facilities, which can be impacted by weather conditions, equipment performance, transmission constraints, and other factors. Wholesale electric revenues at Mississippi Power include FERC-regulated MRA sales as well as market-based sales. Short-term opportunity sales are made at market-based rates that generally provide a margin above the Southern Company system's variable cost to produce the energy.II-20 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual ReportWholesale electric revenues from power sales were as follows: 2018 2017 2016 (in millions)Capacity and other$620 $642 $570Energy1,896 1,784 1,356Total$2,516 $2,426 $1,926In 2018, wholesale revenues increased $90 million, or 3.7%, as compared to the prior year due to a $112 million increase in energy revenues, partially offset by a $22 million decrease in capacity revenues. The increase in energy revenues was primarily related to Southern Power and includes new PPAs related to existing natural gas facilities, new renewable facilities, and an increase in the volume of KWHs sold at existing renewable facilities, partially offset by a decrease in non-PPA revenues from short-term sales. The decrease in capacity revenues was primarily due to the expiration of a wholesale contract in the fourth quarter 2017 at Georgia Power.In 2017, wholesale revenues increased $500 million, or 26.0%, as compared to the prior year due to a $428 million increase in energy revenues and a $72 million increase in capacity revenues, primarily at Southern Power. The increase in energy revenues was primarily due to increases in renewable energy sales arising from new solar and wind facilities and non-PPA revenues from short-term sales. The increase in capacity revenues was primarily due to a PPA related to new natural gas facilities and additional customer capacity requirements.Other Electric RevenuesOther electric revenues decreased $17 million, or 2.5%, in 2018 as compared to the prior year. The decrease is primarily related to a decrease in open access transmission tariff revenues, largely due to a lower rate related to the Tax Reform Legislation. Other electric revenues decreased $17 million, or 2.4%, in 2017, as compared to the prior year. The decrease reflects a $15 million decrease in open access transmission tariff revenues, primarily as a result of the expiration of long-term transmission services contracts at Georgia Power. Energy SalesChanges in revenues are influenced heavily by the change in the volume of energy sold from year to year. KWH sales for 2018 and the percent change from the prior year were as follows: TotalKWHs Total KWHPercent Change Weather-AdjustedPercent Change 2018 2018 2017 2018 2017 (in billions) Residential54.6 8.0 % (5.3)% 1.2 % (0.3)%Commercial53.5 2.1 (2.6) 0.5 (0.9)Industrial53.3 1.1 — 1.1 —Other0.8 (5.5) (4.0) (5.7) (3.9)Total retail162.2 3.6 (2.6) 0.9 % (0.4)%Wholesale49.9 1.9 32.4 Total energy sales212.1 3.2 % 3.9 % Changes in retail energy sales are generally the result of changes in electricity usage by customers, changes in weather, and changes in the number of customers. Retail energy sales increased 5.7 billion KWHs in 2018 as compared to the prior year. This increase was primarily due to colder weather in the first quarter 2018 and warmer weather in the second and third quarters 2018 compared to the corresponding periods in 2017. Weather-adjusted residential KWH sales increased primarily due to customer growth. Weather-adjusted commercial KWH sales increased primarily due to customer growth, partially offset by decreased customer usage resulting from customer initiatives in energy savings and an ongoing migration to the electronic commerce business model. Industrial KWH energy sales increased primarily due to increased sales in the primary metals sector, partially offset by decreased sales in the paper sector.Retail energy sales decreased 4.2 billion KWHs in 2017 as compared to the prior year. This decrease was primarily due to milder weather and decreased customer usage, partially offset by customer growth. Weather-adjusted residential KWH sales decreased II-21 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual Reportprimarily due to decreased customer usage resulting from an increase in penetration of energy-efficient residential appliances and an increase in multi-family housing, partially offset by customer growth. Weather-adjusted commercial KWH sales decreased primarily due to decreased customer usage resulting from customer initiatives in energy savings and an ongoing migration to the electronic commerce business model, partially offset by customer growth. Industrial KWH energy sales were flat primarily due to decreased sales in the paper, stone, clay, and glass, transportation, and chemicals sectors, offset by increased sales in the primary metals and textile sectors. Additionally, Hurricane Irma negatively impacted customer usage for all customer classes.See ""Electric Operating Revenues"" above for a discussion of significant changes in wholesale revenues related to changes in price and KWH sales.Other RevenuesOther revenues increased $66 million, or 64.1%, in 2018 as compared to the prior year. The increase was primarily due to unregulated sales of products and services that were reclassified from other income (expense), net as a result of the adoption of ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC 606). See Note 1 to the financial statements for additional information regarding the adoption of ASC 606.Other revenues increased $20 million in 2017 as compared to the prior year. The increase was primarily due to additional third party infrastructure services.Fuel and Purchased Power ExpensesThe mix of fuel sources for the generation of electricity is determined primarily by demand, the unit cost of fuel consumed, and the availability of generating units. Additionally, the electric utilities purchase a portion of their electricity needs from the wholesale market.Details of the Southern Company system's generation and purchased power were as follows: 2018 2017 2016Total generation (in billions of KWHs)200 194 188Total purchased power (in billions of KWHs)21 20 19Sources of generation (percent) — Gas46 46 46Coal30 30 33Nuclear15 16 16Hydro3 2 2Other6 6 3Cost of fuel, generated (in cents per net KWH)(a) — Gas2.89 2.79 2.48Coal2.80 2.81 3.04Nuclear0.80 0.79 0.81Average cost of fuel, generated (in cents per net KWH)(a)2.50 2.44 2.40Average cost of purchased power (in cents per net KWH)(b)5.46 5.19 4.81(a)For 2018, cost of fuel, generated and average cost of fuel, generated excludes a $30 million adjustment associated with a May 2018 Alabama PSC accounting order related to excess deferred income taxes.(b)Average cost of purchased power includes fuel purchased by the Southern Company system for tolling agreements where power is generated by the provider.In 2018, total fuel and purchased power expenses were $5.6 billion, an increase of $345 million, or 6.6%, as compared to the prior year. The increase was primarily the result of a $178 million increase in the volume of KWHs generated and purchased primarily due to colder weather in the first quarter 2018 and warmer weather in the second and third quarters 2018 compared to the corresponding periods in 2017 and a $137 million increase in the average cost of fuel and purchased power primarily due to higher natural gas prices.In addition, fuel expense increased $30 million in 2018 as a result of an Alabama PSC accounting order authorizing the amortization of a regulatory liability to offset under recovered fuel costs. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – ""Regulatory Matters – Alabama Power – Tax Reform Accounting Order"" herein for additional information.II-22 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual ReportIn 2017, total fuel and purchased power expenses were $5.3 billion, an increase of $152 million, or 3.0%, as compared to the prior year. The increase was primarily the result of a $196 million increase in the average cost of fuel and purchased power primarily due to higher natural gas prices, partially offset by a $44 million net decrease in the volume of KWHs generated and purchased.Fuel and purchased power energy transactions at the traditional electric operating companies are generally offset by fuel revenues and do not have a significant impact on net income. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – ""Regulatory Matters – Fuel Cost Recovery"" herein for additional information. Fuel expenses incurred under Southern Power's PPAs are generally the responsibility of the counterparties and do not significantly impact net income.FuelIn 2018, fuel expense was $4.6 billion, an increase of $237 million, or 5.4%, as compared to the prior year. The increase was primarily due to a 3.6% increase in the average cost of natural gas per KWH generated, a 3.5% increase in the volume of KWHs generated by coal, and a 2.8% increase in the volume of KWHs generated by natural gas.In 2017, fuel expense was $4.4 billion, an increase of $39 million, or 0.9%, as compared to the prior year. The increase was primarily due to a 12.5% increase in the average cost of natural gas per KWH generated and a 2.8% increase in the volume of KWHs generated by natural gas, partially offset by a 7.9% decrease in the volume of KWHs generated by coal and a 7.6% decrease in the average cost of coal per KWH generated.Purchased PowerIn 2018, purchased power expense was $971 million, an increase of $108 million, or 12.5%, as compared to the prior year. The increase was primarily due to a 5.2% increase in the average cost per KWH purchased, primarily as a result of higher natural gas prices, and a 5.2% increase in the volume of KWHs purchased.In 2017, purchased power expense was $863 million, an increase of $113 million, or 15.1%, as compared to the prior year. The increase was primarily due to a 7.9% increase in the average cost per KWH purchased, primarily as a result of higher natural gas prices, and a 5.0% increase in the volume of KWHs purchased.Energy purchases will vary depending on demand for energy within the Southern Company system's electric service territory, the market prices of wholesale energy as compared to the cost of the Southern Company system's generation, and the availability of the Southern Company system's generation.Other Operations and Maintenance ExpensesOther operations and maintenance expenses increased $45 million, or 1.0%, in 2018 as compared to the prior year. The increase was primarily due to a $74 million increase in transmission and distribution costs, primarily related to additional vegetation management at Georgia Power, and $74 million in expenses from unregulated sales of products and services that were reclassified to other operations and maintenance expenses as a result of the adoption of ASC 606. In prior periods, these expenses were included in other income (expense), net. These increases were partially offset by a $32.5 million charge in the first quarter 2017 related to the write-down of Gulf Power's ownership of Plant Scherer Unit 3 in accordance with a rate case settlement agreement, a $30 million net decrease in employee compensation and benefits, including pension costs, largely due to a decrease in active medical costs at Alabama Power and a 2017 employee attrition plan at Georgia Power, and a $27 million decrease in customer accounts, service, and sales costs primarily due to cost-saving initiatives. See Note 1 to the financial statements for additional information regarding the adoption of ASC 606.Other operations and maintenance expenses decreased $76 million, or 1.6%, in 2017 as compared to the prior year. The decrease was primarily due to cost containment and modernization activities implemented at Georgia Power that contributed to decreases of $85 million in generation maintenance costs, $46 million in transmission and distribution overhead line maintenance, $22 million in other employee compensation and benefits, and $22 million in customer accounts, service, and sales costs. Additionally, there was a $34 million decrease in scheduled outage and maintenance costs at generation facilities. These decreases were partially offset by a $56 million increase associated with new facilities at Southern Power, a $37 million increase in transmission and distribution costs primarily due to vegetation management at Alabama Power, and $32.5 million resulting from the write-down of Gulf Power's ownership of Plant Scherer Unit 3 in accordance with a rate case settlement agreement.Production expenses and transmission and distribution expenses fluctuate from year to year due to variations in outage and maintenance schedules and normal changes in the cost of labor and materials.II-23 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual ReportDepreciation and AmortizationDepreciation and amortization increased $108 million, or 4.4%, in 2018 as compared to the prior year. The increase was primarily related to additional plant in service. Additionally, the increase reflects $34 million in depreciation credits recognized in 2017, as authorized in Gulf Power's 2013 rate case settlement.Depreciation and amortization increased $224 million, or 10.0%, in 2017 as compared to the prior year. The increase reflects $203 million related to additional plant in service at the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power and a $13 million increase in amortization related to environmental compliance at Mississippi Power. The increase was partially offset by $34 million in depreciation credits recognized in accordance with Gulf Power's 2013 rate case settlement.See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Southern Company – Regulatory Assets and Liabilities"" and Note 5 to the financial statements under ""Depreciation and Amortization"" for additional information.Taxes Other Than Income TaxesTaxes other than income taxes increased $35 million, or 3.3%, in 2018 as compared to the prior year primarily due to increased property taxes associated with higher assessed values and an increase in municipal franchise fees primarily related to higher retail revenues at Georgia Power.Taxes other than income taxes increased $24 million, or 2.3%, in 2017 as compared to the prior year primarily due to an increase in property taxes due to new facilities at Southern Power.Estimated Loss on Projects Under ConstructionIn the second quarter 2018, an estimated probable loss of $1.1 billion was recorded to reflect Georgia Power's revised estimate to complete construction and start-up of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, which reflects the increase in costs included in the revised base capital cost forecast for which Georgia Power did not seek rate recovery and costs included in the revised construction contingency estimate for which Georgia Power may seek rate recovery as and when such costs are appropriately included in the base capital cost forecast. See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Georgia Power – Nuclear Construction"" for additional information.Charges associated with the Kemper IGCC of $37 million, $3.4 billion, and $428 million were recorded in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. The 2018 pre-tax charge of $37 million primarily resulted from the abandonment and related closure activities and ongoing period costs, net of sales proceeds, for the mine and gasifier-related assets at the Kemper County energy facility. On June 28, 2017, Mississippi Power suspended the gasifier portion of the project and recorded a charge to earnings for the remaining $2.8 billion book value of the gasifier portion of the project. Prior to the suspension, Mississippi Power recorded losses for revisions of estimated costs expected to be incurred on construction of the Kemper IGCC in excess of the $2.88 billion cost cap established by the Mississippi PSC, net of $245 million of grants awarded to the project by the DOE under the Clean Coal Power Initiative Round 2 and excluding the cost of the lignite mine and equipment, the cost of the CO2 pipeline facilities, AFUDC, and certain general exceptions. See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Mississippi Power – Kemper County Energy Facility"" for additional information.Impairment ChargesIn the second quarter 2018, Southern Power recorded a $119 million asset impairment charge in contemplation of the sale of Plant Oleander and Plant Stanton Unit A (together, the Florida Plants) and in the third quarter 2018 recorded a $36 million asset impairment charge on wind turbine equipment held for development projects. There were no asset impairment charges recorded in 2017 or 2016. See Note 15 to the financial statements under ""Southern Power – Sales of Natural Gas Plants"" and "" – Development Projects"" for additional information.Gain on Dispositions, NetGain on dispositions, net decreased $40 million in 2018 and increased $41 million in 2017 as compared to the prior periods primarily due to gains on sales of assets at Georgia Power recorded in 2017.Allowance for Equity Funds Used During ConstructionAFUDC equity decreased $21 million, or 13.8%, in 2018 as compared to the prior year primarily due to Mississippi Power's suspension of the Kemper IGCC construction in June 2017, partially offset by a higher AFUDC rate resulting from a higher equity ratio and lower short-term borrowings at Georgia Power and a higher AFUDC base related to steam and transmission construction projects at Alabama Power.II-24 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual ReportAFUDC equity decreased $48 million, or 24.0%, in 2017 as compared to the prior year primarily due to Mississippi Power's suspension of the Kemper IGCC in June 2017.See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Mississippi Power – Kemper County Energy Facility"" for additional information.Interest Expense, Net of Amounts CapitalizedInterest expense, net of amounts capitalized increased $24 million, or 2.4%, in 2018 as compared to the prior year. The increase was primarily related to Mississippi Power and reflects a $33 million net reduction in interest recorded in 2017 following a settlement with the IRS related to research and experimental deductions and a $29 million reduction in interest capitalized related to the Kemper IGCC suspension in June 2017. The increase also reflects an increase in outstanding borrowings and higher interest rates at Alabama Power, partially offset by a decrease in outstanding borrowings at Georgia Power. See Note 10 to the financial statements under ""Section 174 Research and Experimental Deduction"" for additional information.Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized increased $80 million, or 8.6%, in 2017 as compared to the prior year primarily due to an increase in average outstanding long-term debt, primarily at Southern Power and Georgia Power, and a $37 million decrease in interest capitalized, primarily at Southern Power and Mississippi Power, partially offset by a net reduction of $33 million following Mississippi Power's settlement with the IRS related to research and experimental deductions. See Note 10 to the financial statements under ""Unrecognized Tax Benefits"" for additional information.See Note 8 to the financial statements for additional information.Other Income (Expense), NetOther income (expense), net increased $17 million, or 13.4%, in 2018 as compared to the prior year primarily due to the settlement of Mississippi Power's Deepwater Horizon claim in May 2018 and a gain from a joint-development wind project at Southern Power, which is attributable to Southern Power's partner in the project and fully offset within noncontrolling interests, partially offset by an increase in charitable donations. See Note 3 to the financial statements under ""General Litigation Matters – Mississippi Power"" and Note 7 to the financial statements under ""Southern Power"" for additional information.Other income (expense), net increased $58 million, or 84.1%, in 2017 as compared to the prior year primarily due to a decrease in non-service cost components of net periodic pension and other postretirement benefits costs, partially offset by increases in charitable donations. The change also includes an increase of $159 million in currency losses arising from a translation of euro-denominated fixed-rate notes into U.S. dollars, fully offset by an equal change in gains on the foreign currency hedges that were reclassified from accumulated OCI into earnings at Southern Power. See Note 1 under ""Recently Adopted Accounting Standards"" and Note 11 to the financial statements for additional information on net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit costs.Income TaxesIncome taxes increased $125 million, or 152.4%, in 2018 as compared to the prior year. The increase was primarily due to an increase in pre-tax earnings, primarily resulting from charges recorded in 2017 related to the Kemper IGCC at Mississippi Power, partially offset by the estimated probable loss on Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 at Georgia Power recognized in the second quarter 2018. This increase was partially offset by lower federal income tax expense, as well as benefits from the flowback of excess deferred income taxes as a result of the Tax Reform Legislation.Income taxes decreased $1.0 billion, or 92.5%, in 2017 as compared to the prior year primarily due to $809 million in tax benefits related to estimated losses on the Kemper IGCC at Mississippi Power and $346 million in net tax benefits resulting from the Tax Reform Legislation.See Note 10 to the financial statements for additional information.Dividends on Preferred and Preference Stock of SubsidiariesDividends on preferred and preference stock of subsidiaries decreased $22 million, or 57.9%, in 2018 as compared to 2017 and decreased $7 million, or 15.6%, in 2017 as compared to 2016. These decreases were primarily due to the 2017 redemptions of all outstanding shares of preferred and preference stock at Georgia Power and Gulf Power. See Note 8 to the financial statements for additional information.Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling InterestsSubstantially all noncontrolling interests relate to renewable projects at Southern Power. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests increased $13 million, or 28.3%, in 2018, as compared to the prior year. The increase was primarily due to $20 million of net income allocations due to the sale of a noncontrolling 33% equity interest in SP Solar in 2018 and $14 II-25 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual Reportmillion of other income allocations attributable to a joint-development wind project, partially offset by a reduction of $19 million due to HLBV income allocations between Southern Power and tax equity partners for partnerships entered into during 2018. In 2017, noncontrolling interests increased $10 million, or 28%, compared to 2016 primarily due to additional net income allocations from new solar partnerships.See Note 15 under ""Southern Power"" for additional information. Gas BusinessSouthern Company Gas distributes natural gas through utilities in four states and is involved in several other complementary businesses including gas pipeline investments, wholesale gas services, and gas marketing services.A condensed statement of income for the gas business follows: Amount Increase (Decrease)from Prior Year 2018 2018 2017 (in millions)Operating revenues$3,909 $(11) $2,268Cost of natural gas1,539 (62) 988Cost of other sales12 (17) 19Other operations and maintenance981 36 424Depreciation and amortization500 (1) 263Taxes other than income taxes211 27 113Impairment charges42 42 —Gain on dispositions, net(291) (291) —Total operating expenses2,994 (266) 1,807Operating income915 255 461Earnings from equity method investments148 42 46Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized228 28 119Other income (expense), net1 (43) 32Income taxes464 97 291Net income$372 $129 $129In the table above, the 2018 changes for Southern Company Gas reflect the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017. The Southern Company Gas Dispositions were completed by July 29, 2018 and represent the primary variance driver for the 2018 changes. Additional detailed variance explanations are provided herein. The 2017 changes reflect the 12-month period in 2017 compared to the six-month period following the Merger closing on July 1, 2016, which is the primary variance driver. Additionally, earnings from equity method investments include Southern Company Gas' acquisition of a 50% equity interest in SNG completed in September 2016. See Note 15 to the financial statements under ""Southern Company Gas"" for additional information on Southern Company Gas' investment in SNG and the Southern Company Gas Dispositions.Seasonality of ResultsDuring the period from November through March when natural gas usage and operating revenues are generally higher (Heating Season), more customers are connected to Southern Company Gas' distribution systems, and natural gas usage is higher in periods of colder weather. Occasionally in the summer, operating revenues are impacted due to peak usage by power generators in response to summer energy demands. Southern Company Gas' base operating expenses, excluding cost of natural gas, bad debt expense, and certain incentive compensation costs, are incurred relatively equally over any given year. Thus, operating results can vary significantly from quarter to quarter as a result of seasonality. For 2018, the percentage of operating revenues and net income generated during the Heating Season (January through March and November through December) were 68.7% and 96.0%, respectively. For 2017, the percentage of operating revenues and net income generated during the Heating Season were 67.3% and 73.7%, respectively. The 2017 net income generated during the Heating Season was significantly impacted by additional tax expense recorded in the fourth quarter resulting from the Tax Reform Legislation.

Details of operating revenues were as follows: (in millions) (% change)Operating revenues – prior year$3,920 Estimated change resulting from – Infrastructure replacement programs and base rate changes31 0.8Gas costs and other cost recovery3 0.1Weather13 0.3Wholesale gas services138 3.5Southern Company Gas Dispositions(*)(228) (5.8)Other32 0.8Operating revenues – current year$3,909 (0.3)%(*)Includes a $154 million decrease related to natural gas revenues, including alternative revenue programs, and a $74 million decrease related to other revenues. See Note 15 to the financial statements under ""Southern Company Gas"" for additional information.Revenues from infrastructure replacement programs and base rate changes increased in 2018 primarily due to a $48 million increase at Nicor Gas, partially offset by a $12 million decrease at Atlanta Gas Light. These amounts include the natural gas distribution utilities' continued investments recovered through infrastructure replacement programs and base rate increases less revenue reductions for the impacts of the Tax Reform Legislation. See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Southern Company Gas"" for additional information.Revenues increased due to colder weather, as determined by Heating Degree Days, in 2018 compared to 2017.Revenues from wholesale gas services increased in 2018 primarily due to increased commercial activity, partially offset by derivative losses.Other revenues increased in 2018 primarily due to a $15 million increase from the Dalton Pipeline being placed in service in August 2017 and a $14 million increase in Nicor Gas' revenue taxes.Natural gas distribution rates include provisions to adjust billings for fluctuations in natural gas costs. Therefore, gas costs recovered through natural gas revenues generally equal the amount expensed in cost of natural gas and do not affect net income from the natural gas distribution utilities.Cost of Natural Gas Excluding Atlanta Gas Light, which does not sell natural gas to end-use customers, the natural gas distribution utilities charge their utility customers for natural gas consumed using natural gas cost recovery mechanisms set by the applicable state regulatory agencies. Under these mechanisms, all prudently-incurred natural gas costs are passed through to customers without markup, subject to regulatory review. The natural gas distribution utilities defer or accrue the difference between the actual cost of natural gas and the amount of commodity revenue earned in a given period. The deferred or accrued amount is either billed or refunded to customers prospectively through adjustments to the commodity rate. Deferred natural gas costs are reflected as regulatory assets and accrued natural gas costs are reflected as regulatory liabilities. Therefore, gas costs recovered through natural gas revenues generally equal the amount expensed in cost of natural gas and do not affect net income from the natural gas distribution utilities. Cost of natural gas at the natural gas distribution utilities represented 83.2% of the total cost of natural gas for 2018.Gas marketing services customers are charged for actual and estimated natural gas consumed. Cost of natural gas includes the cost of fuel and associated transportation costs, lost and unaccounted for gas, adjustments to reduce the value of inventories to market value, if applicable, and gains and losses associated with certain derivatives.Cost of natural gas in 2018 was $1.5 billion, a decrease of $62 million, or 3.9%, compared to 2017, which was substantially all as a result of the Southern Company Gas Dispositions.II-27 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual ReportCost of Other SalesCost of other sales in 2018 was $12 million, a decrease of $17 million, or 58.6%, compared to 2017 primarily related to the disposition of Pivotal Home Solutions.Other Operations and Maintenance ExpensesOther operations and maintenance expenses increased $36 million, or 3.8%, in 2018 compared to the prior year. Excluding a $39 million decrease related to the Southern Company Gas Dispositions, other operations and maintenance expenses increased $75 million. This increase was primarily due to a $53 million increase in compensation and benefit costs, including a $12 million one-time increase for the adoption of a new paid time off policy to align with the Southern Company system, a $28 million increase in disposition-related costs, and an $11 million expense for a litigation settlement to facilitate the sale of Pivotal Home Solutions. These increases were partially offset by a $27 million decrease in bad debt expense primarily at Nicor Gas, which was offset by a decrease in revenues as a result of the related regulatory recovery mechanism. See Note 3 to the financial statements under ""General Litigation Matters – Southern Company Gas"" for additional information on the litigation settlement.Depreciation and AmortizationDepreciation and amortization decreased $1 million, or 0.2%, in 2018 compared to the prior year. Excluding a $37 million decrease related to the Southern Company Gas Dispositions, depreciation and amortization increased $36 million. The increase was primarily due to continued infrastructure investments at the natural gas distribution utilities, partially offset by lower amortization of intangible assets as a result of fair value adjustments in acquisition accounting at gas marketing services. See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Southern Company Gas"" for additional information on infrastructure replacement programs.Taxes Other Than Income TaxesTaxes other than income taxes increased $27 million, or 14.7%, in 2018 compared to the prior year. Excluding a $4 million decrease related to the Southern Company Gas Dispositions, taxes other than income taxes increased $31 million. This increase primarily reflects a $13 million increase in revenue tax expenses as a result of higher natural gas revenues, a $12 million increase in Nicor Gas' invested capital tax that reflects a $7 million credit in 2017 to establish a related regulatory asset, and a $4 million increase in property taxes. See Note 15 to the financial statements under ""Southern Company Gas"" for additional information on the Southern Company Gas Dispositions.Impairment ChargesA goodwill impairment charge of $42 million was recorded in 2018 in contemplation of the sale of Pivotal Home Solutions. See Notes 1 and 15 to the financial statements under ""Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets and Liabilities"" and ""Southern Company Gas – Sale of Pivotal Home Solutions,"" respectively, for additional information.Gain on Dispositions, NetGain on dispositions, net was $291 million in 2018 and was associated with the Southern Company Gas Dispositions. The income tax expense on these gains included income tax expense on goodwill not deductible for tax purposes and for which a deferred tax liability had not been recorded previously.Earnings from Equity Method InvestmentsEarnings from equity method investments increased $42 million, or 39.6%, in 2018 compared to the prior year. The increase was primarily due to higher earnings from Southern Company Gas' equity method investment in SNG from new rates effective September 2018 and lower operations and maintenance expenses due to the timing of pipeline maintenance. See Note 7 to the financial statements under ""Southern Company Gas – Equity Method Investments"" for additional information.Interest Expense, Net of Amounts CapitalizedInterest expense, net of amounts capitalized increased $28 million, or 14.0%, in 2018 compared to the prior year. The increase was primarily due to $21 million of additional interest expense related to new debt issuances and a $4 million reduction in capitalized interest primarily due to the Dalton Pipeline being placed in service in August 2017.Other Income (Expense), NetOther income (expense), net decreased $43 million, or 97.7%, in 2018 compared to the prior year. Excluding a $3 million decrease related to the Southern Company Gas Dispositions, other income (expense), net decreased $40 million. This decrease II-28 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual Reportwas primarily due to a $23 million increase in charitable donations and a $13 million decrease in gains from the settlement of contractor litigation claims. See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Southern Company Gas – Infrastructure Replacement Programs and Capital Projects – PRP"" for additional information on the contractor litigation settlement.Income TaxesIncome taxes increased $97 million, or 26.4%, in 2018 compared to the prior year. Excluding a $329 million increase related to the Southern Company Gas Dispositions, including tax expense on the goodwill for which a deferred tax liability had not been previously provided, income taxes decreased $232 million. This decrease was primarily due to a lower federal income tax rate and the flowback of excess deferred taxes as a result of the Tax Reform Legislation. In addition, 2017 included additional tax expense of $130 million from the revaluation of deferred tax assets associated with the Tax Reform Legislation, the enactment of the State of Illinois income tax legislation, and new income tax apportionment factors in several states. See Note 10 to the financial statements for additional information.Other Business ActivitiesSouthern Company's other business activities primarily include the parent company (which does not allocate operating expenses to business units); PowerSecure, which was acquired on May 9, 2016 and is a provider of energy solutions, including distributed infrastructure, energy efficiency products and services, and utility infrastructure services, to customers; Southern Company Holdings, Inc. (Southern Holdings), which invests in various projects, including leveraged lease projects; and Southern Linc, which provides digital wireless communications for use by Southern Company and its subsidiary companies and also markets these services to the public and provides fiber optics services within the Southeast.A condensed statement of income for Southern Company's other business activities follows: Amount Increase (Decrease)from Prior Year 2018 2018 2017 (in millions)Operating revenues$1,015 $444 $268Cost of other sales728 313 223Other operations and maintenance273 69 9Depreciation and amortization66 14 21Taxes other than income taxes6 3 —Impairment charges12 12 —Total operating expenses1,085 411 253Operating income (loss)(70) 33 15Interest expense579 96 178Other income (expense), net(23) (23) 30Income taxes (benefit)(222) 85 (91)Net income (loss)$(450) $(171) $(42)In the table above, the 2018 changes for these other business activities reflect the inclusion of PowerSecure for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017. The 2017 changes reflect the inclusion of PowerSecure for the 12-month period in 2017 compared to the eight-month period following the acquisition on May 9, 2016, which is the primary variance driver. Additional detailed variance explanations are provided herein. See Note 15 to the financial statements under ""Southern Company Acquisition of PowerSecure"" for additional information.Operating RevenuesSouthern Company's operating revenues for these other business activities increased $444 million, or 77.8%, in 2018 as compared to the prior year. The increase was primarily related to PowerSecure's storm restoration services in Puerto Rico. Cost of Other SalesCost of other sales for these other business activities increased $313 million, or 75.4% in 2018. The increase was primarily related to PowerSecure's storm restoration services in Puerto Rico. II-29 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual ReportOther Operations and Maintenance ExpensesOther operations and maintenance expenses for these other business activities increased $69 million, or 33.8%, in 2018 as compared to the prior year. The increase was primarily due to PowerSecure's storm restoration services in Puerto Rico and parent company expenses related to the sale of Gulf Power. Other operations and maintenance expenses for these other business activities increased $9 million, or 4.6%, in 2017 as compared to the prior year. The increase was primarily due to a $44 million increase as a result of the inclusion of PowerSecure results for the 12-month period in 2017 compared to eight months in 2016, partially offset by a $35 million decrease in parent company expenses related to the Merger and the acquisition of PowerSecure.Impairment ChargesImpairment charges for these other business activities were $12 million in 2018. These charges were associated with Southern Linc's tower leases and were recorded in contemplation of the sale of Gulf Power.Interest ExpenseInterest expense for these other business activities increased $96 million, or 19.9%, in 2018 as compared to the prior year primarily due to an increase in variable interest rates and average outstanding debt at the parent company. Interest expense for these other business activities increased $178 million, or 58.4%, in 2017 as compared to the prior year primarily due to an increase in average outstanding long-term debt at the parent company. See Note 8 to the financial statements for additional information.Other Income (Expense), NetOther income (expense), net for these other business activities decreased $23 million in 2018 as compared to the prior year primarily due to charitable donations, partially offset by leveraged lease income at Southern Holdings. See Note 1 to the financial statements for additional information. Other income (expense), net for these other business activities increased $30 million in 2017 as compared to the prior year primarily due to expenses associated with bridge financing for the Merger in 2016.Income Taxes (Benefit)The income tax benefit for these other business activities decreased $85 million, or 27.7%, in 2018 as compared to the prior year primarily as a result of the Tax Reform Legislation, partially offset by an increase in pre-tax losses at the parent company. The income tax benefit for these other business activities increased $91 million, or 42.1%, in 2017 as compared to the prior year primarily as a result of pre-tax earnings (losses) and net tax benefits related to the Tax Reform Legislation. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – ""Income Tax Matters – Federal Tax Reform Legislation"" herein and Note 10 to the financial statements for additional information.Effects of InflationThe electric operating companies and natural gas distribution utilities are subject to rate regulation that is generally based on the recovery of historical and projected costs. The effects of inflation can create an economic loss since the recovery of costs could be in dollars that have less purchasing power. Southern Power is party to long-term contracts reflecting market-based rates, including inflation expectations. Any adverse effect of inflation on Southern Company's results of operations has not been substantial in recent years.FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIALGeneralThe traditional electric operating companies operate as vertically integrated utilities providing electric service to customers within their service territories in the Southeast. On January 1, 2019, Southern Company completed the sale of Gulf Power, one of the traditional electric operating companies, to NextEra Energy. The natural gas distribution utilities provide service to customers in their service territories in Illinois, Georgia, Virginia, and Tennessee. In July 2018, Southern Company Gas completed sales of three of its natural gas distribution utilities. Prices for electricity provided and natural gas distributed to retail customers are set by state PSCs or other applicable state regulatory agencies under cost-based regulatory principles. Retail rates and earnings are reviewed and may be adjusted periodically within certain limitations. Prices for wholesale electricity sales and natural gas distribution, interconnecting transmission lines, and the exchange of electric power are regulated by the FERC. Southern Power continues to focus on long-term PPAs. In 2018, Southern Power completed sales of noncontrolling interests in entities indirectly owning substantially all of its solar facilities and eight of its wind facilities and also completed sales and entered into an agreement to sell certain of its natural gas plants. See ACCOUNTING POLICIES – ""Application of Critical Accounting Policies II-30 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual Reportand Estimates – Utility Regulation"" herein and Note 2 to the financial statements for additional information about regulatory matters.The results of operations for the past three years are not necessarily indicative of Southern Company's future earnings potential. Future earnings will be impacted by the 2018 disposition activities described herein and in Note 15 to the financial statements. The level of Southern Company's future earnings depends on numerous factors that affect the opportunities, challenges, and risks of the Southern Company system's primary businesses of selling electricity and distributing natural gas. These factors include the traditional electric operating companies' and the natural gas distribution utilities' ability to maintain constructive regulatory environments that allow for the timely recovery of prudently-incurred costs during a time of increasing costs, continued customer growth, and, for the traditional electric operating companies, the weak pace of growth in electricity use per customer, especially in residential and commercial markets. Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 construction and rate recovery and the profitability of Southern Power's competitive wholesale business are also major factors.Earnings in the electricity business will also depend upon maintaining and growing sales, considering, among other things, the adoption and/or penetration rates of increasingly energy-efficient technologies, increasing volumes of electronic commerce transactions, and more multi-family home construction, all of which could contribute to a net reduction in customer usage. Earnings for both the electricity and natural gas businesses are subject to a variety of other factors. These factors include weather, competition, new energy contracts with other utilities and other wholesale customers, energy conservation practiced by customers, the use of alternative energy sources by customers, the prices of electricity and natural gas, the price elasticity of demand, and the rate of economic growth or decline in the service territory. In addition, the level of future earnings for the wholesale electric business also depends on numerous factors including regulatory matters, creditworthiness of customers, total electric generating capacity available and related costs, the development or acquisition of renewable facilities and other energy projects, and the successful remarketing of capacity as current contracts expire. Demand for electricity and natural gas is primarily driven by the pace of economic growth that may be affected by changes in regional and global economic conditions, which may impact future earnings. In addition, the volatility of natural gas prices has a significant impact on the natural gas distribution utilities' customer rates, long-term competitive position against other energy sources, and the ability of Southern Company Gas' gas marketing services and wholesale gas services businesses to capture value from locational and seasonal spreads. Additionally, changes in commodity prices subject a significant portion of Southern Company Gas' operations to earnings variability.As part of its ongoing effort to adapt to changing market conditions, Southern Company continues to evaluate and consider a wide array of potential business strategies. These strategies may include business combinations, partnerships, and acquisitions involving other utility or non-utility businesses or properties, disposition of certain assets or businesses, internal restructuring, or some combination thereof. Furthermore, Southern Company may engage in new business ventures that arise from competitive and regulatory changes in the utility industry. Pursuit of any of the above strategies, or any combination thereof, may significantly affect the business operations, risks, and financial condition of Southern Company.On January 1, 2019, Southern Company completed the sale of Gulf Power to NextEra Energy for an aggregate cash purchase price of approximately $5.8 billion (less $1.3 billion of indebtedness assumed), subject to customary working capital adjustments. In 2018, net income attributable to Gulf Power was $160 million.On June 4, 2018, Southern Company Gas completed the stock sale of Pivotal Home Solutions to American Water Enterprises LLC for a total cash purchase price of $365 million. On July 1, 2018, a Southern Company Gas subsidiary, Pivotal Utility Holdings, completed the sales of the assets of two of its natural gas distribution utilities, Elizabethtown Gas and Elkton Gas, to South Jersey Industries, Inc. for a total cash purchase price of $1.7 billion. On July 29, 2018, Southern Company Gas and its wholly-owned direct subsidiary, NUI Corporation, completed the stock sale of Pivotal Utility Holdings, which primarily consisted of Florida City Gas, to NextEra Energy for a total cash purchase price of $587 million. The total cash purchase price for each transaction includes final working capital and other adjustments.The Southern Company Gas Dispositions resulted in a net loss of $51 million, which includes $342 million of tax expense. The after-tax impacts of these dispositions included income tax expense on goodwill not deductible for tax purposes and for which a deferred tax liability had not been recorded previously. In addition, a goodwill impairment charge of $42 million was recorded during 2018 in contemplation of the sale of Pivotal Home Solutions.On May 22, 2018, Southern Power sold a noncontrolling 33% equity interest in SP Solar, a limited partnership indirectly owning substantially all of Southern Power's solar facilities, for approximately $1.2 billion and, on December 11, 2018, sold a noncontrolling tax equity interest in SP Wind, a holding company owning a portfolio of eight operating wind facilities, for approximately $1.2 billion. Additionally, on November 5, 2018, Southern Power entered into an agreement to sell all of its equity interests in Plant Mankato (including the 385-MW expansion currently under construction) for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $650 million. The completion of the disposition is subject to the expansion unit reaching commercial operation as well as various other customary conditions to closing, including FERC and state commission approvals, and the sale is expected II-31 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual Reportto close mid-2019. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time. On December 4, 2018, Southern Power sold of all of its equity interests in the Florida Plants to NextEra Energy for approximately $203 million.See Note 15 to the financial statements for additional information regarding disposition activities.Environmental MattersThe Southern Company system's operations are regulated by state and federal environmental agencies through a variety of laws and regulations governing air, water, land, and protection of other natural resources. The Southern Company system maintains comprehensive environmental compliance and GHG strategies to assess upcoming requirements and compliance costs associated with these environmental laws and regulations. The costs, including capital expenditures, operations and maintenance costs, and costs reflected in ARO liabilities, required to comply with environmental laws and regulations and to achieve stated goals may impact future electric generating unit retirement and replacement decisions, results of operations, cash flows, and/or financial condition. Related costs may result from the installation of additional environmental controls, closure and monitoring of CCR facilities, unit retirements, or changing fuel sources for certain existing units, as well as related upgrades to the Southern Company system's transmission and distribution (electric and natural gas) systems. A major portion of these costs is expected to be recovered through retail and wholesale rates. The ultimate impact of environmental laws and regulations and the GHG goals discussed herein will depend on various factors, such as state adoption and implementation of requirements, the availability and cost of any deployed technology, fuel prices, and the outcome of pending and/or future legal challenges.New or revised environmental laws and regulations could affect many areas of the traditional electric operating companies', Southern Power's, and the natural gas distribution utilities' operations. The impact of any such changes cannot be determined at this time. Environmental compliance costs could affect earnings if such costs cannot continue to be recovered in rates on a timely basis for the traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities or through long-term wholesale agreements for the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power. Further, increased costs that are recovered through regulated rates could contribute to reduced demand for electricity and natural gas, which could negatively affect results of operations, cash flows, and/or financial condition. Additionally, many commercial and industrial customers may also be affected by existing and future environmental requirements, which for some may have the potential to ultimately affect their demand for electricity and natural gas.The Southern Company system's commitment to the environment has been demonstrated in many ways, including participating in partnerships resulting in approximately $140 million of funding that has restored or enhanced more than 2 million acres of habitat since 2003; the removal of more than 15.5 million pounds of trash and debris from waterways between 2000 and 2018 through the Renew Our Rivers program; a 21.2% reduction in surface water withdrawal from 2015 to 2017; reductions in SO2 and NOX air emissions of 98% and 89%, respectively, from 1990 to 2017; the reduction of mercury air emissions of over 95% from 2005 to 2017; and the Southern Company system's changing energy mix.Through 2018, the traditional electric operating companies have invested approximately $14.2 billion in environmental capital retrofit projects to comply with environmental requirements, with annual totals of approximately $1.3 billion, $0.9 billion, and $0.5 billion for 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. Although the timing, requirements, and estimated costs could change as environmental laws and regulations are adopted or modified, as compliance plans are revised or updated, and as legal challenges to rules are initiated or completed, the Southern Company system's current compliance strategy estimates capital expenditures of $1.4 billion from 2019 through 2023, with annual totals of approximately $0.5 billion, $0.2 billion, $0.3 billion, $0.3 billion, and $0.2 billion for 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023, respectively. These estimates do not include any potential compliance costs associated with pending regulation of CO2 emissions from fossil fuel-fired electric generating units. See ""Global Climate Issues"" herein for additional information. The Southern Company system also anticipates substantial expenditures associated with ash pond closure and ground water monitoring under the CCR Rule, which are reflected in Southern Company's ARO liabilities. See FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY – ""Capital Requirements and Contractual Obligations"" herein and Note 6 to the financial statements for additional information.Environmental Laws and RegulationsAir QualityThe EPA has set National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for six air pollutants (carbon monoxide, lead, nitrogen dioxide, ozone, particulate matter, and SO2) to protect and improve the nation's air quality, which it reviews and revises periodically. Following a NAAQS revision, states are required to develop an EPA-approved plan to protect air quality. These state plans can require additional emission controls, improvements in control efficiency, or fuel changes which can result in increased compliance and operational costs. NAAQS requirements can also adversely affect the siting of new electric generating facilities. All areas within the Southern Company system's electric service territory have been designated as attainment for all NAAQS II-32 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual Reportexcept for a seven-county area within metropolitan Atlanta that is not in attainment with the 2015 ozone NAAQS and the area surrounding Plant Hammond, in Georgia, which will not be designated attainment or nonattainment for the 2010 SO2 standard until December 2020. If areas are designated as nonattainment in the future, increased compliance costs could result. See ""Regulatory Matters – Georgia Power – Integrated Resource Plan"" herein for information regarding Georgia Power's request to decertify and retire Plant Hammond.In 2011, the EPA finalized the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR) to address impacts of SO2 and NOX emissions from fossil fuel-fired electric generating plants. CSAPR establishes emissions trading programs and budgets for certain states and allocates emissions allowances for sources in those states. In 2016, the EPA published a final rule establishing more stringent ozone season NOX emissions budgets in Alabama, Mississippi, and Texas. Georgia's ozone season NOX emissions budget remained unchanged. The EPA also removed North Carolina from this particular CSAPR program. The outcome of ongoing CSAPR litigation concerning the 2016 CSAPR rule, to which Mississippi Power is a party, could have an impact on the State of Mississippi's ozone season NOX emissions budget. Increases in either future fossil fuel-fired generation or the availability or cost of CSAPR allowances could have a negative financial impact on results of operations for Southern Company.The EPA finalized regional haze regulations in 2005 and 2017. These regulations require states, tribal governments, and various federal agencies to develop and implement plans to reduce pollutants that impair visibility and demonstrate reasonable progress toward the goal of restoring natural visibility conditions in certain areas, including national parks and wilderness areas. States must submit a revised state implementation plan (SIP) to the EPA demonstrating continued reasonable progress towards achieving visibility improvement goals. These plans could require reductions in certain pollutants, such as particulate matter, SO2, and NOX, which could result in increased compliance costs. The EPA approved the regional progress SIPs for the States of Alabama and Georgia, but only issued a limited approval of the regional progress SIP for the State of Mississippi because Mississippi must revise the best available retrofit technology (BART) provisions of its SIP. Therefore, Mississippi Power's Plant Daniel is the only electric generating unit in the Southern Company system that continues to be evaluated under the regional haze BART provisions. Mississippi Power is required to submit Plant Daniel's BART analysis to the State of Mississippi by summer 2019. Requirements for further reduction of these pollutants at Plant Daniel could increase compliance costs.Water QualityIn 2014, the EPA finalized requirements under Section 316(b) of the Clean Water Act (CWA) to regulate cooling water intake structures (CWIS) to minimize their effects on fish and other aquatic life at existing power plants (e.g. coal, natural gas, oil, and nuclear generating plants) and manufacturing facilities. The regulation requires plant-specific studies to determine applicable CWIS changes to protect organisms that either get caught on the intake screens (impingement) or are drawn into the cooling system (entrainment). The Southern Company system is conducting these studies and currently anticipates applicable CWIS changes may include fish-friendly CWIS screens with fish return systems and minor additions of monitoring equipment at certain plants. However, the ultimate impact of this rule will depend on the outcome of these plant-specific studies, any additional protective measures required to be incorporated into each plant's National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit based on site-specific factors, and the outcome of any legal challenges.In 2015, the EPA finalized the steam electric effluent limitations guidelines (ELG) rule (2015 ELG Rule) that set national standards for wastewater discharges from new and existing steam electric generating units generating greater than 50 MWs. The 2015 ELG Rule prohibits effluent discharges of certain waste streams and imposes stringent limits on flue gas desulfurization (scrubber) wastewater discharges. The revised technology-based limits and the CCR Rule require extensive changes to existing ash and wastewater management systems or the installation and operation of new ash and wastewater management systems. Compliance with the 2015 ELG Rule is expected to require capital expenditures and increased operational costs primarily for the traditional electric operating companies' coal-fired electric generation. State environmental agencies will incorporate specific compliance applicability dates in the NPDES permitting process for each ELG waste stream no later than December 31, 2023. The EPA is scheduled to issue a new rulemaking by December 2019 that could revise the limitations and applicability dates of two of the waste streams regulated in the 2015 ELG Rule. The impact of any changes to the 2015 ELG Rule will depend on the content of the new rule and the outcome of any legal challenges.In 2015, the EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) jointly published a final rule that revised the regulatory definition of waters of the United States (WOTUS) for all CWA programs. The rule significantly expanded the scope of federal jurisdiction over waterbodies (such as rivers, streams, canals, and wastewater treatment ponds), which could impact new generation projects and permitting and reporting requirements associated with the installation, expansion, and maintenance of transmission, distribution, and pipeline projects. The EPA and the Corps are expected to publish a final rule in 2019 to replace the 2015 WOTUS definition. The impact of any changes to the 2015 WOTUS rule will depend on the content of this final rule and the outcome of any legal challenges.II-33 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual ReportCoal Combustion ResidualsIn 2015, the EPA finalized non-hazardous solid waste regulations for the disposal of CCR, including coal ash and gypsum, in landfills and surface impoundments (ash ponds) at active generating power plants. In addition to the EPA's CCR Rule, the States of Alabama and Georgia have also finalized regulations regarding the handling of CCR within their respective states. The EPA's CCR Rule requires landfills and ash ponds to be evaluated against a set of performance criteria and potentially closed if minimum criteria are not met. Closure of existing landfills and ash ponds could require installation of equipment and infrastructure to manage CCR in accordance with the CCR Rule. Based on cost estimates for closure and monitoring of landfills and ash ponds pursuant to the CCR Rule, the Southern Company system recorded AROs for each CCR unit in 2015. As further analysis was performed and closure details were developed, the traditional electric operating companies have continued to periodically update these cost estimates, as discussed further below.The EPA published certain amendments to the CCR Rule, which became effective August 29, 2018. These amendments extend the date from April 2019 to October 31, 2020 to cease sending CCR and other waste streams to ash ponds that demonstrate compliance with all except two of the specified performance criteria.On August 21, 2018, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit issued a decision suggesting the EPA should regulate previously-excluded inactive ash ponds located at retired generation facilities and questioning both the ability of unlined ash ponds to continue operating no matter the performance criteria results and the classification of clay-lined landfills and ash ponds. These developments could impact the expected timing of the traditional electric operating companies' landfill and ash pond closure activities, but the extent of any impact will depend on the outcome of ongoing litigation, anticipated EPA rulemaking action to establish further guidance, and the outcome of any legal challenges.In June 2018, Alabama Power recorded an increase of approximately $1.2 billion to its AROs related to the CCR Rule. The revised cost estimates were based on information from feasibility studies performed on ash ponds in use at plants operated by Alabama Power, including at a plant jointly-owned by Mississippi Power. During the second quarter 2018, Alabama Power's management completed its analysis of these studies which indicated that additional closure costs, primarily related to increases in estimated ash volume, water management requirements, and design revisions, will be required to close these ash ponds under the planned closure-in-place methodology. As the level of work becomes more defined in the next 12 months, it is likely that these cost estimates will change and the change could be material.In December 2018, Georgia Power recorded an increase of approximately $3.1 billion to its AROs related to the CCR Rule and the related state rule. During the second half of 2018, Georgia Power completed a strategic assessment related to its plans to close the ash ponds at all of its generating plants in compliance with the CCR Rule and the related state rule. This assessment included engineering and constructability studies related to design assumptions for ash pond closures and advanced engineering methods. The results indicated that additional closure costs will be required to close these ash ponds, primarily due to changes in closure strategies, the estimated amount of ash to be excavated, and additional water management requirements necessary to support closure strategies. These factors also impact the estimated timing of future cash outlays.The traditional electric operating companies expect to periodically update their ARO cost estimates. Absent continued recovery of ARO costs through regulated rates, Southern Company's results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition could be materially impacted. See FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY – ""Capital Requirements and Contractual Obligations"" herein and Note 6 to the financial statements for additional information.The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.Nuclear DecommissioningIn June 2018, Alabama Power completed an updated decommissioning cost site study for Plant Farley. The estimated cost of decommissioning based on the study resulted in an increase in Alabama Power's ARO liability of approximately $300 million. Amounts previously contributed to Alabama Power's external trust funds are currently projected to be adequate to meet the updated decommissioning obligations. In December 2018, Georgia Power completed updated decommissioning cost site studies for Plant Hatch and Plant Vogtle Units 1 and 2. The estimated cost of decommissioning based on the studies resulted in an increase in Georgia Power's ARO liability of approximately $130 million. Georgia Power currently collects $4 million and $2 million annually in rates, which is used to fund external nuclear decommissioning trusts for Plant Hatch and Plant Vogtle Units 1 and 2, respectively. Georgia Power expects the Georgia PSC to review and adjust, if necessary, these amounts in the Georgia Power 2019 Base Rate Case.See Note 6 to the financial statements for additional information.II-34 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual ReportEnvironmental RemediationThe Southern Company system must comply with environmental laws and regulations governing the handling and disposal of waste and releases of hazardous substances. Under these various laws and regulations, the Southern Company system could incur substantial costs to clean up affected sites. The traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities conduct studies to determine the extent of any required cleanup and Southern Company has recognized the estimated costs to clean up known impacted sites in its financial statements. Amounts for cleanup and ongoing monitoring costs were not material for any year presented. The traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities in Illinois and Georgia have all received authority from their respective state PSCs or other applicable state regulatory agencies to recover approved environmental compliance costs through regulatory mechanisms. These regulatory mechanisms are adjusted annually or as necessary within limits approved by the state PSCs or other applicable state regulatory agencies. The traditional electric operating companies and Southern Company Gas may be liable for some or all required cleanup costs for additional sites that may require environmental remediation. See Note 3 to the financial statements under ""Environmental Remediation"" for additional information.Global Climate IssuesOn August 31, 2018, the EPA published a proposed rule known as the Affordable Clean Energy (ACE) Rule, which is intended to replace a regulation enacted in 2015 known as the Clean Power Plan (CPP), that would limit CO2 emissions from existing fossil fuel-fired electric generating units. The CPP has been stayed by the U.S. Supreme Court since 2016. The ACE Rule would require states to develop GHG unit-specific emission rate standards based on heat-rate efficiency improvements for existing fossil fuel-fired steam units. As proposed, combustion turbines, including natural gas combined cycles, are not affected sources. As of January 1, 2019, the Southern Company system has ownership interests in 40 fossil fuel-fired steam units to which the proposed ACE Rule is applicable. The ultimate impact of this rule to the Southern Company system is currently unknown and will depend on changes between the proposal and the final rule, subsequent state plan developments and requirements, and any associated legal challenges.On December 20, 2018, the EPA published a proposed review of the Standards of Performance for Greenhouse Gas Emissions from New, Modified, and Reconstructed Stationary Sources: Electric Utility Generating Units final rule (2015 NSPS rule). The EPA's final 2015 NSPS rule set standards of performance for new, modified, and reconstructed electric utility generating units which included stationary combustion turbines and fossil-fired steam boilers. This proposal reduces the stringency of the 2015 NSPS rule by not basing the new and reconstructed fossil-fired steam boiler and IGCC standards on partial carbon capture and sequestration. The impact of any changes to this rule will depend on the content of the final rule and the outcome of any legal challenges.Additional domestic GHG policies may emerge in the future requiring the United States to transition to a lower GHG emitting economy. The Southern Company system has transitioned from an electric generating mix of 70% coal and 15% natural gas in 2007 to a mix of 30% coal and 46% natural gas in 2018, along with over 8,000 MWs of renewable resources. This transition has been supported in part by the Southern Company system retiring 4,226 MWs of coal- and oil-fired generating capacity since 2010 and converting 3,280 MWs of generating capacity from coal to natural gas since 2015. In addition, Southern Company Gas has replaced approximately 5,600 miles of bare steel and cast-iron pipe, resulting in removal of approximately 2.5 million metric tons of GHG from its natural gas distribution system since 1998. Based on ownership or financial control of facilities, the Southern Company system's 2017 GHG emissions (CO2 equivalent) were approximately 98 million metric tons, with 2018 emissions estimated at 98 million metric tons. This equates to a reduction of 36% between 2007 and 2018. The 2018 estimates include GHG emissions attributable to each of Elizabethtown Gas, Elkton Gas, Florida City Gas, and the Florida Plants through the date of the applicable disposition. See Note 15 to the financial statements for additional information regarding disposition activities.In April 2018, Southern Company established an intermediate goal of a 50% reduction in carbon emissions from 2007 levels by 2030 and a long-term goal of low- to no-carbon operations by 2050. To achieve these goals, the Southern Company system expects to continue growing its renewable energy portfolio, optimize technology advancements to modernize its transmission and distribution systems, increase the use of natural gas for generation, complete ongoing construction projects, including Georgia Power's interest in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, invest in energy efficiency, and continue research and development efforts focused on technologies to lower GHG emissions. The Southern Company system's ability to achieve these goals also will be dependent on many external factors, including supportive national energy policies, low natural gas prices, and the development, deployment, and advancement of relevant energy technologies.II-35 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual ReportFERC MattersOpen Access Transmission TariffOn May 10, 2018, AMEA and Cooperative Energy filed with the FERC a complaint against SCS and the traditional electric operating companies claiming that the current 11.25% base ROE used in calculating the annual transmission revenue requirements of the traditional electric operating companies' open access transmission tariff is unjust and unreasonable as measured by the applicable FERC standards. The complaint requested that the base ROE be set no higher than 8.65% and that the FERC order refunds for the difference in revenue requirements that results from applying a just and reasonable ROE established in this proceeding upon determining the current ROE is unjust and unreasonable. On June 18, 2018, SCS and the traditional electric operating companies filed their response challenging the adequacy of the showing presented by the complainants and offering support for the current ROE. On September 6, 2018, the FERC issued an order establishing a refund effective date of May 10, 2018 in the event a refund is due and initiating an investigation and settlement procedures regarding the current base ROE. Through December 31, 2018, the estimated maximum potential refund is not expected to be material to Southern Company's results of operations or cash flows. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.Southern Company GasSouthern Company Gas' gas pipeline investments business is involved in two significant pipeline construction projects, the Atlantic Coast Pipeline (5% ownership) and the PennEast Pipeline (20% ownership), which received FERC approval in October 2017 and January 2018, respectively. Southern Company Gas' total capital expenditures, excluding AFUDC, at completion are expected to be between $350 million and $390 million for the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and $276 million for the PennEast Pipeline. These projects, along with Southern Company Gas' existing pipelines, are intended to provide diverse sources of natural gas supplies to customers, resolve current and long-term supply planning for new capacity, enhance system reliability, and generate economic development in the areas served.Work continues with state and federal agencies to obtain the required permits to begin construction on the PennEast Pipeline. Any material delays may impact forecasted capital expenditures and the expected in-service date.The Atlantic Coast Pipeline has experienced challenges to its permits since construction began in 2018. During the third and fourth quarters 2018, a FERC stop work order, together with delays in obtaining permits necessary for construction and construction delays due to judicial actions, impacted the cost and schedule for the project. As a result, total project cost estimates have increased from between $6.0 billion and $6.5 billion to between $7.0 billion and $7.8 billion, excluding financing costs. Southern Company Gas' share of the total project costs is 5% and Southern Company Gas' investment at December 31, 2018 totaled $83 million. The operator of the joint venture currently expects to achieve a late 2020 in-service date for at least key segments of the Atlantic Coast Pipeline, while the remainder may extend into early 2021. Southern Company Gas has evaluated the recoverability of its investment and determined there was no impairment as of December 31, 2018. Abnormal weather, work delays (including due to judicial or regulatory action), and other conditions may result in additional cost or schedule modifications, which could result in an impairment of Southern Company Gas' investment and could have a material impact on Southern Company's financial statements.The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time. See Notes 7 and 9 to the financial statements under ""Southern Company Gas – Equity Method Investments"" and ""Guarantees,"" respectively, for additional information on these pipeline projects.Regulatory MattersAlabama PowerAlabama Power's revenues from regulated retail operations are collected through various rate mechanisms subject to the oversight of the Alabama PSC. Alabama Power currently recovers its costs from the regulated retail business primarily through Rate RSE, Rate CNP, Rate ECR, and Rate NDR. In addition, the Alabama PSC issues accounting orders to address current events impacting Alabama Power. See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Alabama Power"" for additional information regarding Alabama Power's rate mechanisms and accounting orders.Rate RSEThe Alabama PSC has adopted Rate RSE that provides for periodic annual adjustments based upon Alabama Power's projected weighted common equity return (WCER) compared to an allowable range. Rate RSE adjustments are based on forward-looking information for the applicable upcoming calendar year. Rate RSE adjustments for any two-year period, when averaged together, cannot exceed 4.0% and any annual adjustment is limited to 5.0%. When the projected WCER is under the allowed range, there is II-36 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual Reportan adjusting point of 5.98% and eligibility for a performance-based adder of seven basis points, or 0.07%, to the WCER adjusting point if Alabama Power (i) has an ""A"" credit rating equivalent with at least one of the recognized rating agencies or (ii) is in the top one-third of a designated customer value benchmark survey. If Alabama Power's actual retail return is above the allowed WCER range, the excess will be refunded to customers unless otherwise directed by the Alabama PSC; however, there is no provision for additional customer billings should the actual retail return fall below the WCER range. Prior to January 2019, retail rates remained unchanged when the WCER range was between 5.75% and 6.21%.On May 1, 2018, the Alabama PSC approved modifications to Rate RSE and other commitments designed to position Alabama Power to address the growing pressure on its credit quality resulting from the Tax Reform Legislation, without increasing retail rates under Rate RSE in the near term. Alabama Power plans to reduce growth in total debt by increasing equity, with corresponding reductions in debt issuances, thereby de-leveraging its capital structure. Alabama Power's goal is to achieve an equity ratio of approximately 55% by the end of 2025. At December 31, 2018, Alabama Power's equity ratio was approximately 47%.The approved modifications to Rate RSE began for billings in January 2019. The modifications include reducing the top of the allowed WCER range from 6.21% to 6.15% and modifications to the refund mechanism applicable to prior year actual results. The modifications to the refund mechanism allow Alabama Power to retain a portion of the revenue that causes the actual WCER for a given year to exceed the allowed range.Generally, if Alabama Power's actual WCER is between 6.15% and 7.65%, customers will receive 25% of the amount between 6.15% and 6.65%, 40% of the amount between 6.65% and 7.15%, and 75% of the amount between 7.15% and 7.65%. Customers will receive all amounts in excess of an actual WCER of 7.65%.In conjunction with these modifications to Rate RSE, on May 8, 2018, Alabama Power consented to a moratorium on any upward adjustments under Rate RSE for 2019 and 2020 and will also return $50 million to customers through bill credits in 2019.On November 30, 2018, Alabama Power made its required annual Rate RSE submission to the Alabama PSC of projected data for calendar year 2019. Projected earnings were within the specified range; therefore, retail rates under Rate RSE remain unchanged for 2019.At December 31, 2018, Alabama Power's retail return exceeded the allowed WCER range, which resulted in Alabama Power establishing a regulatory liability of $109 million for Rate RSE refunds. In accordance with an Alabama PSC order issued on February 5, 2019, Alabama Power will apply $75 million to reduce the Rate ECR under recovered balance and the remaining $34 million will be refunded to customers through bill credits in July through September 2019.Rate CNP PPAAlabama Power's retail rates, approved by the Alabama PSC, provide for adjustments under Rate CNP to recognize the placing of new generating facilities into retail service. Alabama Power may also recover retail costs associated with certificated PPAs under Rate CNP PPA. No adjustments to Rate CNP PPA occurred during the period 2016 through 2018 and no adjustment is expected in 2019.In accordance with an accounting order issued in February 2017 by the Alabama PSC, Alabama Power reclassified $69 million of the December 31, 2016 Rate CNP PPA under recovered balance to a separate regulatory asset. The amortization of the new regulatory asset through Rate RSE will begin concurrently with the effective date of Alabama Power's next depreciation study, which is expected to occur no later than 2022.Rate CNP ComplianceRate CNP Compliance allows for the recovery of Alabama Power's retail costs associated with laws, regulations, and other such mandates directed at the utility industry involving the environment, security, reliability, safety, sustainability, or similar considerations impacting Alabama Power's facilities or operations. Rate CNP Compliance is based on forward-looking information and provides for the recovery of these costs pursuant to a factor that is calculated annually. Compliance costs to be recovered include operations and maintenance expenses, depreciation, and a return on certain invested capital. Revenues for Rate CNP Compliance, as recorded on the financial statements, are adjusted for differences in actual recoverable costs and amounts billed in current regulated rates. Accordingly, changes in the billing factor will have no significant effect on revenues or net income, but will affect annual cash flow. Changes in Rate CNP Compliance-related operations and maintenance expenses and depreciation generally will have no effect on net income.In accordance with an accounting order issued in February 2017 by the Alabama PSC, Alabama Power reclassified $36 million of its under recovered balance in Rate CNP Compliance to a separate regulatory asset. The amortization of the new regulatory asset II-37 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual Reportthrough Rate RSE will begin concurrently with the effective date of Alabama Power's next depreciation study, which is expected to occur no later than 2022.On November 30, 2018, Alabama Power submitted calculations associated with its cost of complying with environmental mandates, as provided under Rate CNP Compliance. The filing reflected a projected unrecovered retail revenue requirement for environmental compliance of approximately $205 million, which is being recovered in the billing months of January 2019 through December 2019.Tax Reform Accounting OrderOn May 1, 2018, the Alabama PSC approved an accounting order that authorized Alabama Power to defer the benefits of federal excess deferred income taxes associated with the Tax Reform Legislation for the year ended December 31, 2018 as a regulatory liability and to use up to $30 million of such deferrals to offset under recovered amounts under Rate ECR. The estimated deferrals for the year ended December 31, 2018 totaled approximately $63 million, subject to adjustment following the filing of the 2018 tax return, of which $30 million was used to offset the Rate ECR under recovered balance and $33 million is recorded in other regulatory liabilities, deferred on the balance sheet to be used for the benefit of customers as determined by the Alabama PSC at a future date. See Note 10 to the financial statements under ""Current and Deferred Income Taxes"" for additional information.Environmental Accounting OrderBased on an order from the Alabama PSC (Environmental Accounting Order), Alabama Power is allowed to establish a regulatory asset to record the unrecovered investment costs, including the unrecovered plant asset balance and the unrecovered costs associated with site removal and closure associated with future unit retirements caused by environmental regulations. The regulatory asset is being amortized and recovered over the affected unit's remaining useful life, as established prior to the decision regarding early retirement through Rate CNP Compliance. At December 31, 2018, this regulatory asset had a balance of $42 million. See ""Environmental Matters – Environmental Laws and Regulations"" herein for additional information regarding environmental regulations.Subsequent to December 31, 2018, Alabama Power determined that Plant Gorgas Units 8, 9, and 10 (approximately 1,000 MWs) will be retired by April 15, 2019 due to the expected costs of compliance with federal and state environmental regulations. In accordance with the Environmental Accounting Order, approximately $740 million of net investment costs will be transferred to a regulatory asset at the retirement date and recovered over the affected units' remaining useful lives, as established prior to the decision to retire.Georgia PowerGeorgia Power's revenues from regulated retail operations are collected through various rate mechanisms subject to the oversight of the Georgia PSC. Georgia Power currently recovers its costs from the regulated retail business through the 2013 ARP, which includes traditional base tariff rates, Demand-Side Management (DSM) tariffs, Environmental Compliance Cost Recovery (ECCR) tariffs, and Municipal Franchise Fee (MFF) tariffs. Georgia Power is scheduled to file a base rate case by July 1, 2019, which may continue or modify these tariffs. In addition, financing costs on certified construction costs of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 are being collected through the NCCR tariff and fuel costs are collected through a separate fuel cost recovery tariff. See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Georgia Power"" for additional information.Rate PlansPursuant to the terms and conditions of a settlement agreement related to Southern Company's acquisition of Southern Company Gas approved by the Georgia PSC in 2016, the 2013 ARP will continue in effect until December 31, 2019, and Georgia Power will be required to file its next base rate case by July 1, 2019. Furthermore, through December 31, 2019, Georgia Power will retain its merger savings, net of transition costs, as defined in the settlement agreement; through December 31, 2022, such net merger savings will be shared on a 60/40 basis with customers; thereafter, all merger savings will be retained by customers. See Note 15 to the financial statements under ""Southern Company Merger with Southern Company Gas"" for additional information regarding the Merger.There were no changes to Georgia Power's traditional base tariff rates, ECCR tariff, DSM tariffs, or MFF tariff in 2017 or 2018.Under the 2013 ARP, Georgia Power's retail ROE is set at 10.95% and earnings are evaluated against a retail ROE range of 10.00% to 12.00%. Two-thirds of any earnings above 12.00% will be directly refunded to customers, with the remaining one-third retained by Georgia Power. There will be no recovery of any earnings shortfall below 10.00% on an actual basis. In 2016, Georgia Power's retail ROE exceeded 12.00%, and Georgia Power refunded to retail customers in 2018 approximately $40 million as approved by the Georgia PSC. On February 5, 2019, the Georgia PSC approved a settlement between Georgia Power and the staff II-38 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual Reportof the Georgia PSC under which Georgia Power's retail ROE for 2017 was stipulated to exceed 12.00% and Georgia Power will reduce certain regulatory assets by approximately $4 million in lieu of providing refunds to retail customers. In 2018, Georgia Power's retail ROE exceeded 12.00%, and Georgia Power accrued approximately $100 million to refund to retail customers, subject to review and approval by the Georgia PSC.On April 3, 2018, the Georgia PSC approved the Georgia Power Tax Reform Settlement Agreement. Pursuant to the Georgia Power Tax Reform Settlement Agreement, to reflect the federal income tax rate reduction impact of the Tax Reform Legislation, Georgia Power will refund to customers a total of $330 million through bill credits. Georgia Power issued bill credits of approximately $130 million in 2018 and will issue bill credits of approximately $95 million in June 2019 and $105 million in February 2020. In addition, Georgia Power is deferring as a regulatory liability (i) the revenue equivalent of the tax expense reduction resulting from legislation lowering the Georgia state income tax rate from 6.00% to 5.75% in 2019 and (ii) the entire benefit of federal and state excess accumulated deferred income taxes, which is expected to total approximately $700 million at December 31, 2019. At December 31, 2018, the related regulatory liability balance totaled $610 million. The amortization of these regulatory liabilities is expected to be addressed in the Georgia Power 2019 Base Rate Case. If there is not a base rate case in 2019, customers will receive $185 million in annual bill credits beginning in 2020, with any additional federal and state income tax savings deferred as a regulatory liability, until Georgia Power's next base rate case.To address some of the negative cash flow and credit quality impacts of the Tax Reform Legislation, the Georgia PSC also approved an increase in Georgia Power's retail equity ratio to the lower of (i) Georgia Power's actual common equity weight in its capital structure or (ii) 55%, until the Georgia Power 2019 Base Rate Case. At December 31, 2018, Georgia Power's actual retail common equity ratio (on a 13-month average basis) was approximately 55%. Benefits from reduced federal income tax rates in excess of the amounts refunded to customers will be retained by Georgia Power to cover the carrying costs of the incremental equity in 2018 and 2019.Integrated Resource PlanSee ""Environmental Matters"" herein for additional information regarding proposed and final EPA rules and regulations, including revisions to ELG for steam electric power plants and additional regulations of CCR and CO2.In 2016, the Georgia PSC approved Georgia Power's triennial Integrated Resource Plan (2016 IRP) including the reclassification of the remaining net book value of Plant Mitchell Unit 3 and costs associated with materials and supplies remaining at the unit retirement date to a regulatory asset. Recovery of the unit's net book value will continue through December 31, 2019, as provided in the 2013 ARP. The timing of the recovery of the remaining balance of the unit's net book value as of December 31, 2019 and costs associated with materials and supplies remaining at the unit retirement date was deferred for consideration in the Georgia Power 2019 Base Rate Case.In the 2016 IRP, the Georgia PSC also approved recovery of costs up to $99 million through June 30, 2019 to preserve nuclear generation as an option at a future generation site in Stewart County, Georgia. In March 2017, the Georgia PSC approved Georgia Power's decision to suspend work at the site due to changing economics, including lower load forecasts and fuel costs. The timing of recovery for costs incurred of approximately $50 million is expected to be determined by the Georgia PSC in the Georgia Power 2019 Base Rate Case.On January 31, 2019, Georgia Power filed its triennial IRP (2019 IRP). The filing includes a request to decertify and retire Plant Hammond Units 1 through 4 (840 MWs) and Plant McIntosh Unit 1 (142.5 MWs) upon approval of the 2019 IRP.In the 2019 IRP, Georgia Power requested approval to reclassify the remaining net book value of Plant Hammond Units 1 through 4 (approximately $520 million at December 31, 2018) upon retirement to a regulatory asset to be amortized ratably over a period equal to the applicable unit's remaining useful life through 2035. For Plant McIntosh Unit 1, Georgia Power requested approval to reclassify the remaining net book value (approximately $40 million at December 31, 2018) upon retirement to a regulatory asset to be amortized over a three-year period to be determined in the Georgia Power 2019 Base Rate Case. Georgia Power also requested approval to reclassify any unusable material and supplies inventory balances remaining at the applicable unit's retirement date to a regulatory asset for recovery over a period to be determined in the Georgia Power 2019 Base Rate Case.The 2019 IRP also includes a request to certify approximately 25 MWs of capacity at Plant Scherer Unit 3 for the retail jurisdiction beginning January 1, 2020, following the expiration of a wholesale PPA. The 2019 IRP also includes details regarding ARO costs associated with ash pond and landfill closures and post-closure care. Georgia Power requested the timing and rate of recovery of these costs be determined by the Georgia PSC in the Georgia Power 2019 Base Rate Case. See ""Environmental Matters – Environmental Laws and Regulations – Coal Combustion Residuals"" and FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY – ""Capital Requirements and Contractual Obligations"" herein and Note 6 to the financial statements for additional information regarding Georgia Power's AROs.II-39 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual ReportGeorgia Power also requested approval to issue two capacity-based requests for proposals (RFP). If approved, the first capacity-based RFP will seek resources that can provide capacity beginning in 2022 or 2023 and the second capacity-based RFP will seek resources that can provide capacity beginning in 2026, 2027, or 2028. Additionally, the 2019 IRP includes a request to procure an additional 1,000 MWs of renewable resources through a competitive bidding process. Georgia Power also proposed to invest in a portfolio of up to 50 MWs of battery energy storage technologies.A decision from the Georgia PSC on the 2019 IRP is expected in mid-2019.The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.Storm Damage RecoveryGeorgia Power is accruing $30 million annually through December 31, 2019, as provided in the 2013 ARP, for incremental operations and maintenance costs of damage from major storms to its transmission and distribution facilities. At December 31, 2018, the total balance in the regulatory asset related to storm damage was $416 million. During October 2018, Hurricane Michael caused significant damage to Georgia Power's transmission and distribution facilities. The incremental restoration costs related to this hurricane deferred in the regulatory asset for storm damage totaled approximately $115 million. Hurricanes Irma and Matthew also caused significant damage to Georgia Power's transmission and distribution facilities during September 2017 and October 2016, respectively. The incremental restoration costs related to Hurricanes Irma and Matthew deferred in Georgia Power's regulatory asset for storm damage totaled approximately $250 million. The rate of storm damage cost recovery is expected to be adjusted as part of the Georgia Power 2019 Base Rate Case and further adjusted in future regulatory proceedings as necessary. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time. See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Georgia Power – Storm Damage Recovery"" for additional information regarding Georgia Power's storm damage reserve.Mississippi PowerMississippi Power's retail base rates generally are set under the PEP, a rate plan approved by the Mississippi PSC. Two filings are made for each calendar year: the PEP projected filing, which is typically filed prior to the beginning of the year based on a projected revenue requirement, and the PEP lookback filing, which is filed after the end of the year and allows for review of the actual revenue requirement compared to the projected filing.On February 7, 2018, Mississippi Power revised its annual projected PEP filing for 2018 to reflect the impacts of the Tax Reform Legislation. The revised filing requested an increase of $26 million in annual revenues, based on a performance adjusted ROE of 9.33% and an increased equity ratio of 55%. On July 27, 2018, Mississippi Power and the MPUS entered into a settlement agreement with respect to the 2018 PEP filing and all unresolved PEP filings for prior years (PEP Settlement Agreement), which was approved by the Mississippi PSC on August 7, 2018. Rates under the PEP Settlement Agreement became effective with the first billing cycle of September 2018. The PEP Settlement Agreement provides for an increase of approximately $21.6 million in annual base retail revenues, which excludes certain compensation costs contested by the MPUS, as well as approximately $2 million which was subsequently approved for recovery through Mississippi Power's 2018 Energy Efficiency Cost Rider.Pursuant to the PEP Settlement Agreement, Mississippi Power's performance-adjusted allowed ROE is 9.31% and its allowed equity ratio is capped at 51%, pending further review by the Mississippi PSC. In lieu of the requested equity ratio increase, Mississippi Power retained $44 million of excess accumulated deferred income taxes resulting from the Tax Reform Legislation until the conclusion of Mississippi Power's next base rate case, which is scheduled to be filed in the fourth quarter 2019 (Mississippi Power 2019 Base Rate Case). Further, Mississippi Power agreed to seek equity contributions sufficient to restore its equity ratio to 50% by December 31, 2018.Pursuant to the PEP Settlement Agreement, PEP proceedings are suspended until after the conclusion of the Mississippi Power 2019 Base Rate Case and Mississippi Power is not required to make any PEP filings for regulatory years 2018, 2019, and 2020. The PEP Settlement Agreement also resolved all open PEP filings with no change to customer rates.Kemper County Energy FacilityIn 2018, Mississippi Power recorded pre-tax charges to income of $37 million ($27 million after tax), primarily resulting from the abandonment and related closure activities and ongoing period costs, net of sales proceeds, for the mine and gasifier-related assets at the Kemper County energy facility. In addition, Mississippi Power recorded a credit to earnings of $95 million in the fourth quarter 2018 primarily resulting from the reduction of a valuation allowance for a state income tax net operating loss (NOL) carryforward associated with the Kemper County energy facility. Additional closure costs for the mine and gasifier-related assets, currently estimated at up to $10 million pre-tax (excluding salvage, net of dismantlement costs), may be incurred through the first half of 2020. In addition, period costs, including, but not limited to, costs for compliance and safety, ARO accretion, and property taxes for the mine and gasifier-related assets, are estimated to total $11 million in 2019 and $2 million to $4 million annually in II-40 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual Report2020 through 2023. Mississippi Power is currently evaluating its options regarding the final disposition of the CO2 pipeline, including removal of the pipeline. This evaluation is expected to be complete later in 2019. If Mississippi Power ultimately decides to remove the CO2 pipeline, the cost of removal could have a material impact on Southern Company's financial statements. The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.The combined cycle and associated common facilities portions of the Kemper County energy facility were dedicated as Plant Ratcliffe on April 27, 2018.For additional information on the Kemper County energy facility, see Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Mississippi Power – Kemper County Energy Facility.""Reserve Margin PlanOn August 6, 2018, Mississippi Power filed its proposed Reserve Margin Plan (RMP), as required by the Mississippi PSC's order in the docket established for the purposes of pursuing a global settlement of the costs related to the Kemper County energy facility. Under the RMP, Mississippi Power proposed alternatives that would reduce its reserve margin, with the most economic of the alternatives being the two-year and seven-year acceleration of the retirement of Plant Watson Units 4 and 5, respectively, to the first quarter 2022 and the four-year acceleration of the retirement of Plant Greene County Units 1 and 2 to the third quarter 2021 and the third quarter 2022, respectively, in order to lower or avoid operating costs. The Plant Greene County unit retirements would require the completion by Alabama Power of proposed transmission and system reliability improvements, as well as agreement by Alabama Power. The RMP filing also states that, in the event the Mississippi PSC ultimately approves an alternative that includes an accelerated retirement, Mississippi Power would require authorization to defer in a regulatory asset for future recovery the remaining net book value of the units at the time of retirement. A decision by the Mississippi PSC that does not include recovery of the remaining book value of any generating units retired could have a material impact on Southern Company's financial statements. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.Government GrantsIn 2010, the DOE, through a cooperative agreement with SCS, agreed to fund $270 million of the Kemper County energy facility through the grants awarded to the project by the DOE under the Clean Coal Power Initiative Round 2. Through December 31, 2018, Mississippi Power received total DOE grants of $387 million, of which $382 million reduced the construction costs of the Kemper County energy facility and $5 million reimbursed Mississippi Power for expenses associated with DOE reporting. On December 12, 2018, Mississippi Power filed with the DOE its request for property closeout certification under the contract related to the grants received. Mississippi Power and the DOE are currently in discussions regarding the requested closeout and property disposition, which may require payment to the DOE for a portion of certain property that is to be retained by Mississippi Power. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time; however, it could have a significant impact on Southern Company's financial statements.Southern Company GasThe natural gas distribution utilities are subject to regulation and oversight by their respective state regulatory agencies for the rates charged to their customers and other matters.The natural gas market for Atlanta Gas Light was deregulated in 1997. Accordingly, Marketers, rather than a traditional utility, sell natural gas to end-use customers in Georgia and handle customer billing functions. Atlanta Gas Light earns revenue for its distribution services by charging rates to its customers based primarily on monthly fixed charges that are set by the Georgia PSC and adjusted periodically.With the exception of Atlanta Gas Light, the natural gas distribution utilities are authorized by the relevant regulatory agencies in the states in which they serve to use natural gas cost recovery mechanisms that adjust rates to reflect changes in the wholesale cost of natural gas and ensure recovery of all costs prudently incurred in purchasing natural gas for customers. Natural gas cost recovery revenues are adjusted for differences in actual recoverable natural gas costs and amounts billed in current regulated rates. Changes in the billing factor will not have a significant effect on revenues or net income, but will affect cash flows. In addition to natural gas cost recovery mechanisms, there are other cost recovery mechanisms, such as regulatory riders, which vary by utility but allow recovery of certain costs, such as those related to infrastructure replacement programs, as well as environmental remediation and energy efficiency plans. See Note 1 to the financial statements under ""Cost of Natural Gas"" for additional information.II-41 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual ReportInfrastructure Replacement Programs and Capital ProjectsIn addition to capital expenditures recovered through base rates by each of the natural gas distribution utilities, Nicor Gas and Virginia Natural Gas have separate rate riders that provide timely recovery of capital expenditures for specific infrastructure replacement programs. These infrastructure replacement programs and capital projects are risk-based and designed to update and replace cast iron, bare steel, and mid-vintage plastic materials or expand the natural gas distribution systems to improve reliability and meet operational flexibility and growth. The total expected investment under the infrastructure replacement programs for 2019 is $408 million. See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Southern Company Gas – Infrastructure Replacement Programs and Capital Projects"" for additional information.Rate ProceedingsOn February 23, 2018, Atlanta Gas Light revised its annual base rate filing to reflect the impacts of the Tax Reform Legislation and requested a $16 million rate reduction in 2018. On May 15, 2018, the Georgia PSC approved a stipulation for Atlanta Gas Light's annual base rates to remain at the 2017 level for 2018 and 2019, with customer credits of $8 million in each of July 2018 and October 2018 to reflect the impacts of the Tax Reform Legislation. The Georgia PSC maintained Atlanta Gas Light's previously authorized earnings band based on a ROE between 10.55% and 10.95% and increased the allowed equity ratio by 4% to an equity ratio of 55% to address the negative cash flow and credit metric impacts of the Tax Reform Legislation. Additionally, Atlanta Gas Light is required to file a traditional base rate case on or before June 1, 2019 for rates effective January 1, 2020.On January 31, 2018, the Illinois Commission approved a $137 million increase in Nicor Gas' annual base rate revenues, including $93 million related to the recovery of investments under Nicor Gas' infrastructure program, effective February 8, 2018, based on a ROE of 9.8%.On May 2, 2018, the Illinois Commission approved Nicor Gas' rehearing request for revised base rates to incorporate the reduction in the federal income tax rate as a result of the Tax Reform Legislation. The resulting decrease of approximately $44 million in annual base rate revenues became effective May 5, 2018. Nicor Gas' previously-authorized capital structure and ROE of 9.80% were not addressed in the rehearing and remain unchanged. On November 9, 2018, Nicor Gas filed a general base rate case with the Illinois Commission requesting a $230 million increase in annual base rate revenues. The requested increase is based on a projected test year for the 12-month period ending September 30, 2020, a ROE of 10.6%, and an increase in the equity ratio from 52.0% to 54.0% to address the negative cash flow and credit metric impacts of the Tax Reform Legislation. The Illinois Commission is expected to rule on the requested increase within the 11-month statutory time limit, after which rate adjustments will be effective. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.Fuel Cost RecoveryThe traditional electric operating companies each have established fuel cost recovery rates approved by their respective state PSCs. Fuel cost recovery revenues are adjusted for differences in actual recoverable fuel costs and amounts billed in current regulated rates. Accordingly, changes in the billing factor will not have a significant effect on Southern Company's revenues or net income, but will affect cash flow. The traditional electric operating companies continuously monitor their under or over recovered fuel cost balances and make appropriate filings with their state PSCs to adjust fuel cost recovery rates as necessary.See Note 1 to the financial statements under ""Revenues"" and Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Alabama Power – Rate ECR,"" ""Georgia Power – Fuel Cost Recovery,"" and ""Mississippi Power – Fuel Cost Recovery"" for additional information.Construction ProgramOverviewThe subsidiary companies of Southern Company are engaged in continuous construction programs to accommodate existing and estimated future loads on their respective systems. The Southern Company system intends to continue its strategy of developing and constructing new electric generating facilities, adding environmental modifications to certain existing units, expanding and improving the electric transmission and distribution systems, and updating and expanding the natural gas distribution systems. For the traditional electric operating companies, major generation construction projects are subject to state PSC approval in order to be included in retail rates. While Southern Power generally constructs and acquires generation assets covered by long-term PPAs, any uncontracted capacity could negatively affect future earnings. Southern Company Gas is engaged in various infrastructure improvement programs designed to update or expand the natural gas distribution systems of the natural gas distribution utilities to improve reliability and meet operational flexibility and growth. The natural gas distribution utilities recover their investment and a return associated with these infrastructure programs through their regulated rates. See Note 15 to the financial statements under ""Southern Power"" for additional information about costs relating to Southern Power's acquisitions that involve construction of renewable energy facilities and Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Southern Company Gas – Infrastructure Replacement II-42 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual ReportPrograms and Capital Projects"" for additional information regarding infrastructure improvement programs at the natural gas distribution utilities.The Southern Company system's construction program is currently estimated to total approximately $8.0 billion, $7.7 billion, $6.7 billion, $6.3 billion, and $6.0 billion for 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023, respectively. The largest construction project currently underway in the Southern Company system is Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 (45.7% ownership interest by Georgia Power in the two units, each with approximately 1,100 MWs). See FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY – ""Capital Requirements and Contractual Obligations"" herein for additional information regarding Southern Company's capital requirements for its subsidiaries' construction programs.Nuclear ConstructionIn 2009, the Georgia PSC certified construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Georgia Power holds a 45.7% ownership interest in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. In 2012, the NRC issued the related combined construction and operating licenses, which allowed full construction of the two AP1000 nuclear units (with electric generating capacity of approximately 1,100 MWs each) and related facilities to begin. Until March 2017, construction on Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 continued under the Vogtle 3 and 4 Agreement, which was a substantially fixed price agreement. In March 2017, the EPC Contractor filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.In connection with the EPC Contractor's bankruptcy filing, Georgia Power, acting for itself and as agent for the Vogtle Owners, entered into the Interim Assessment Agreement with the EPC Contractor to allow construction to continue. The Interim Assessment Agreement expired in July 2017 when Georgia Power, acting for itself and as agent for the other Vogtle Owners, and the EPC Contractor entered into the Vogtle Services Agreement. Under the Vogtle Services Agreement, Westinghouse provides facility design and engineering services, procurement and technical support, and staff augmentation on a time and materials cost basis. The Vogtle Services Agreement provides that it will continue until the start-up and testing of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 are complete and electricity is generated and sold from both units. The Vogtle Services Agreement is terminable by the Vogtle Owners upon 30 days' written notice.In October 2017, Georgia Power, acting for itself and as agent for the other Vogtle Owners, executed the Bechtel Agreement, a cost reimbursable plus fee arrangement, whereby Bechtel is reimbursed for actual costs plus a base fee and an at-risk fee, which is subject to adjustment based on Bechtel's performance against cost and schedule targets. Each Vogtle Owner is severally (not jointly) liable for its proportionate share, based on its ownership interest, of all amounts owed to Bechtel under the Bechtel Agreement. The Vogtle Owners may terminate the Bechtel Agreement at any time for their convenience, provided that the Vogtle Owners will be required to pay amounts related to work performed prior to the termination (including the applicable portion of the base fee), certain termination-related costs, and, at certain stages of the work, the applicable portion of the at-risk fee. Bechtel may terminate the Bechtel Agreement under certain circumstances, including certain Vogtle Owner suspensions of work, certain breaches of the Bechtel Agreement by the Vogtle Owners, Vogtle Owner insolvency, and certain other events. Pursuant to the Loan Guarantee Agreement between Georgia Power and the DOE, Georgia Power is required to obtain the DOE's approval of the Bechtel Agreement prior to obtaining any further advances under the Loan Guarantee Agreement.Cost and ScheduleGeorgia Power's approximate proportionate share of the remaining estimated capital cost to complete Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 by the expected in-service dates of November 2021 and November 2022, respectively, is as follows: (in billions)Base project capital cost forecast(a)(b)$8.0Construction contingency estimate0.4Total project capital cost forecast(a)(b)8.4Net investment as of December 31, 2018(b)(4.6)Remaining estimate to complete(a)$3.8(a)Excludes financing costs expected to be capitalized through AFUDC of approximately $315 million.(b)Net of $1.7 billion received from Toshiba under the Guarantee Settlement Agreement and approximately $188 million in related Customer Refunds.Georgia Power estimates that its financing costs for construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 will total approximately $3.1 billion, of which $1.9 billion had been incurred through December 31, 2018.As construction continues, challenges with management of contractors, subcontractors, and vendors; labor productivity, availability, and/or cost escalation; procurement, fabrication, delivery, assembly, and/or installation and testing, including any II-43 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual Reportrequired engineering changes, of plant systems, structures, and components (some of which are based on new technology that only recently began initial operation in the global nuclear industry at this scale); or other issues could arise and change the projected schedule and estimated cost. Monthly construction production targets required to maintain the current project schedule will continue to increase significantly throughout 2019. To meet these increasing monthly targets, existing craft construction productivity must improve and additional craft laborers must be retained and deployed.Georgia Power and Southern Nuclear believe it is a leading practice in connection with a construction project of this size and complexity to periodically validate recent construction progress in comparison to the projected schedule and to verify and update quantities of commodities remaining to install, labor productivity, and forecasted staffing needs. This verification process, led by Southern Nuclear, was underway as of December 31, 2018 and is expected to be completed during the second quarter 2019. Georgia Power currently does not anticipate any material changes to the total estimated project capital cost forecast for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 or the expected in-service dates of November 2021 and November 2022, respectively, resulting from this verification process. However, the ultimate impact on cost and schedule, if any, will not be known until the verification process is completed. Georgia Power is required to report the results and any project impacts to the Georgia PSC by May 15, 2019.There have been technical and procedural challenges to the construction and licensing of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 at the federal and state level and additional challenges may arise. Processes are in place that are designed to assure compliance with the requirements specified in the Westinghouse Design Control Document and the combined construction and operating licenses, including inspections by Southern Nuclear and the NRC that occur throughout construction. As a result of such compliance processes, certain license amendment requests have been filed and approved or are pending before the NRC. Various design and other licensing-based compliance matters, including the timely resolution of ITAAC and the related approvals by the NRC, may arise, which may result in additional license amendments or require other resolution. If any license amendment requests or other licensing-based compliance issues are not resolved in a timely manner, there may be delays in the project schedule that could result in increased costs.The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time. However, any extension of the project schedule is currently estimated to result in additional base capital costs of approximately $50 million per month, based on Georgia Power's ownership interests, and AFUDC of approximately $12 million per month. While Georgia Power is not precluded from seeking recovery of any future capital cost forecast increase, management will ultimately determine whether or not to seek recovery. Any further changes to the capital cost forecast that are not expected to be recoverable through regulated rates will be required to be charged to income and such charges could be material.Joint Owner ContractsIn November 2017, the Vogtle Owners entered into an amendment to their joint ownership agreements for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 to provide for, among other conditions, additional Vogtle Owner approval requirements. Effective August 31, 2018, the Vogtle Owners further amended the joint ownership agreements to clarify and provide procedures for certain provisions of the joint ownership agreements related to adverse events that require the vote of the holders of at least 90% of the ownership interests in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 to continue construction (as amended, and together with the November 2017 amendment, the Vogtle Joint Ownership Agreements). The Vogtle Joint Ownership Agreements also confirm that the Vogtle Owners' sole recourse against Georgia Power or Southern Nuclear for any action or inaction in connection with their performance as agent for the Vogtle Owners is limited to removal of Georgia Power and/or Southern Nuclear as agent, except in cases of willful misconduct.As a result of the increase in the total project capital cost forecast and Georgia Power's decision not to seek rate recovery of the increase in the base capital costs as described below, the holders of at least 90% of the ownership interests in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 were required to vote to continue construction. On September 26, 2018, the Vogtle Owners unanimously voted to continue construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4.Amendments to the Vogtle Joint Ownership AgreementsIn connection with the vote to continue construction, Georgia Power entered into (i) the Vogtle Owner Term Sheet with the other Vogtle Owners and MEAG's wholly-owned subsidiaries MEAG SPVJ, MEAG Power SPVM, LLC (MEAG SPVM), and MEAG Power SPVP, LLC (MEAG SPVP) to take certain actions which partially mitigate potential financial exposure for the other Vogtle Owners, including additional amendments to the Vogtle Joint Ownership Agreements and the purchase of PTCs from the other Vogtle Owners, and (ii) the MEAG Term Sheet with MEAG and MEAG SPVJ to provide funding with respect to MEAG SPVJ's ownership interest in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 (Project J) under certain circumstances. On January 14, 2019, Georgia Power, MEAG, and MEAG SPVJ entered into an agreement to implement the provisions of the MEAG Term Sheet (MEAG Funding Agreement). On February 18, 2019, Georgia Power, the other Vogtle Owners, and MEAG's wholly-owned subsidiaries MEAG SPVJ, MEAG SPVM, and MEAG SPVP entered into certain amendments to the Vogtle Joint Ownership Agreements to implement the provisions of the Vogtle Owner Term Sheet (Global Amendments).II-44 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual ReportPursuant to the Global Amendments, and consistent with the Vogtle Owner Term Sheet, the Vogtle Joint Ownership Agreements were modified as follows: (i) each Vogtle Owner must pay its proportionate share of qualifying construction costs for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 based on its ownership percentage up to the estimated cost at completion (EAC) for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 which formed the basis of Georgia Power's forecast of $8.4 billion in the nineteenth VCM plus $800 million; (ii) Georgia Power will be responsible for 55.7% of actual qualifying construction costs between $800 million and $1.6 billion over the EAC in the nineteenth VCM (resulting in $80 million of potential additional costs to Georgia Power), with the remaining Vogtle Owners responsible for 44.3% of such costs pro rata in accordance with their respective ownership interests; and (iii) Georgia Power will be responsible for 65.7% of qualifying construction costs between $1.6 billion and $2.1 billion over the EAC in the nineteenth VCM (resulting in a further $100 million of potential additional costs to Georgia Power), with the remaining Vogtle Owners responsible for 34.3% of such costs pro rata in accordance with their respective ownership interests.If the EAC is revised and exceeds the EAC in the nineteenth VCM by more than $2.1 billion, each of the other Vogtle Owners will have a one-time option at the time the project budget forecast is so revised to tender a portion of its ownership interest to Georgia Power in exchange for Georgia Power's agreement to pay 100% of such Vogtle Owner's remaining share of total construction costs in excess of the EAC in the nineteenth VCM plus $2.1 billion. In this event, Georgia Power will have the option of cancelling the project in lieu of purchasing a portion of the ownership interest of any other Vogtle Owner. If Georgia Power accepts the offer to purchase a portion of another Vogtle Owner's ownership interest in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, the ownership interest(s) to be conveyed from the tendering Vogtle Owner(s) to Georgia Power will be calculated based on the proportion of the cumulative amount of construction costs paid by each such tendering Vogtle Owner(s) and by Georgia Power as of the COD of Plant Vogtle Unit 4. For purposes of this calculation, payments made by Georgia Power on behalf of another Vogtle Owner in accordance with the second and third items described in the paragraph above will be treated as payments made by the applicable Vogtle Owner.In the event the actual costs of construction at completion of a Unit are less than the EAC reflected in the nineteenth VCM report and such Unit is placed in service in accordance with the schedule projected in the nineteenth VCM report (i.e., Plant Vogtle Unit 3 is placed in service by November 2021 or Plant Vogtle Unit 4 is placed in service by November 2022), Georgia Power will be entitled to 60.7% of the cost savings with respect to the relevant Unit and the remaining Vogtle Owners will be entitled to 39.3% of such savings on a pro rata basis in accordance with their respective ownership interests.For purposes of the foregoing provisions, qualifying construction costs will not include costs (i) resulting from force majeure events, including governmental actions or inactions (or significant delays associated with issuance of such actions) that affect the licensing, completion, start-up, operations, or financing of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, administrative proceedings or litigation regarding ITAAC or other regulatory challenges to commencement of operation of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, and changes in laws or regulations governing Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, (ii) legal fees and legal expenses incurred due to litigation with contractors or subcontractors that are not subsidiaries or affiliates of Southern Company, and (iii) additional costs caused by requests from the Vogtle Owners other than Georgia Power, except for the exercise of a right to vote granted under the Vogtle Joint Ownership Agreements, that increase costs by $100,000 or more.Pursuant to the Global Amendments, and consistent with the Vogtle Owner Term Sheet, the provisions of the Vogtle Joint Ownership Agreements requiring that Vogtle Owners holding 90% of the ownership interests in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 vote to continue construction following certain adverse events (Project Adverse Events) were modified. Pursuant to the Global Amendments, the holders of at least 90% of the ownership interests in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 must vote to continue construction if certain Project Adverse Events occur, including: (i) the bankruptcy of Toshiba; (ii) the termination or rejection in bankruptcy of certain agreements, including the Vogtle Services Agreement, the Bechtel Agreement, or the agency agreement with Southern Nuclear; (iii) Georgia Power publicly announces its intention not to submit for rate recovery any portion of its investment in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 or the Georgia PSC determines that any of Georgia Power's costs relating to the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 will not be recovered in retail rates, excluding any additional amounts paid by Georgia Power on behalf of the other Vogtle Owners pursuant to the Global Amendments described above and the first 6% of costs during any six-month VCM reporting period that are disallowed by the Georgia PSC for recovery, or for which Georgia Power elects not to seek cost recovery, through retail rates; and (iv) an incremental extension of one year or more over the most recently approved schedule. Under the Global Amendments, Georgia Power may cancel the project at any time in its sole discretion.In addition, pursuant to the Vogtle Joint Ownership Agreements, the required approval of holders of ownership interests in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 is at least (i) 90% for a change of the primary construction contractor and (ii) 67% for material amendments to the Vogtle Services Agreement or agreements with Southern Nuclear or the primary construction contractor, including the Bechtel Agreement.The Global Amendments provide that if the holders of at least 90% of the ownership interests fail to vote in favor of continuing the project following any future Project Adverse Event, work on Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 will continue for a period of 30 days if II-45 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual Reportthe holders of more than 50% of the ownership interests vote in favor of continuing construction (Majority Voting Owners). In such a case, the Vogtle Owners (i) have agreed to negotiate in good faith towards the resumption of the project, (ii) if no agreement is reached during such 30-day period, the project will be cancelled, and (iii) in the event of such a cancellation, the Majority Voting Owners will be obligated to reimburse any other Vogtle Owner for the incremental costs it incurred during such 30-day negotiation period.Purchase of PTCs During Commercial OperationPursuant to the Global Amendments, and consistent with the Vogtle Owner Term Sheet, Georgia Power has agreed to purchase additional PTCs from OPC, Dalton, MEAG SPVM, MEAG SPVP, and MEAG SPVJ (to the extent any MEAG SPVJ PTC rights remain after any purchases required under the MEAG Funding Agreement as described below) at varying purchase prices dependent upon the actual cost to complete construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 as compared to the EAC reflected in the nineteenth VCM report. The purchases are at the option of the applicable Vogtle Owner.Potential Funding to MEAG Project JPursuant to the MEAG Funding Agreement, and consistent with the MEAG Term Sheet, if MEAG SPVJ is unable to make its payments due under the Vogtle Joint Ownership Agreements solely as a result of the occurrence of one of the following situations that materially impedes access to capital markets for MEAG for Project J: (i) the conduct of JEA or the City of Jacksonville, such as JEA's legal challenges of its obligations under a PPA with MEAG (PPA-J), or (ii) PPA-J is declared void by a court of competent jurisdiction or rejected by JEA under the applicable provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code (each of (i) and (ii), a JEA Default), at MEAG's request, Georgia Power will purchase from MEAG SPVJ the rights to PTCs attributable to MEAG SPVJ's share of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 (approximately 206 MWs) within 30 days of such request at varying prices dependent upon the stage of construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. The aggregate purchase price of the PTCs, together with any advances made as described in the next paragraph, shall not exceed $300 million.At the option of MEAG, as an alternative or supplement to Georgia Power's purchase of PTCs as described above, Georgia Power has agreed to provide up to $250 million in funding to MEAG for Project J in the form of advances (either advances under the Vogtle Joint Ownership Agreements or the purchase of MEAG Project J bonds, at the discretion of Georgia Power), subject to any required approvals of the Georgia PSC and the DOE.In the event MEAG SPVJ certifies to Georgia Power that it is unable to fund its obligations under the Vogtle Joint Ownership Agreements as a result of a JEA Default and Georgia Power becomes obligated to provide funding as described above, MEAG is required to (i) assign to Georgia Power its right to vote on any future Project Adverse Event and (ii) diligently pursue JEA for its breach of PPA-J. In addition, Georgia Power agreed that it will not sue MEAG for any amounts due from MEAG SPVJ under MEAG's guarantee of MEAG SPVJ's obligations so long as MEAG SPVJ complies with the terms of the MEAG Funding Agreement as to its payment obligations and the other non-payment provisions of the Vogtle Joint Ownership Agreements.Under the terms of the MEAG Funding Agreement, Georgia Power may cancel the project in lieu of providing funding in the form of advances or PTC purchases.The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.Regulatory MattersIn 2009, the Georgia PSC voted to certify construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 with a certified capital cost of $4.418 billion. In addition, in 2009 the Georgia PSC approved inclusion of the Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 related CWIP accounts in rate base, and the State of Georgia enacted the Georgia Nuclear Energy Financing Act, which allows Georgia Power to recover financing costs for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Financing costs are recovered on all applicable certified costs through annual adjustments to the NCCR tariff up to the certified capital cost of $4.418 billion. At December 31, 2018, Georgia Power had recovered approximately $1.9 billion of financing costs. Financing costs related to capital costs above $4.418 billion will be recovered through AFUDC; however, Georgia Power will not record AFUDC related to any capital costs in excess of the total deemed reasonable by the Georgia PSC (currently $7.3 billion) and not requested for rate recovery. On December 18, 2018, the Georgia PSC approved Georgia Power's request to increase the NCCR tariff by $88 million annually, effective January 1, 2019.Georgia Power is required to file semi-annual VCM reports with the Georgia PSC by February 28 and August 31 of each year. In 2013, in connection with the eighth VCM report, the Georgia PSC approved a stipulation between Georgia Power and the staff of the Georgia PSC to waive the requirement to amend the Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 certificate in accordance with the 2009 certification order until the completion of Plant Vogtle Unit 3, or earlier if deemed appropriate by the Georgia PSC and Georgia Power.II-46 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual ReportIn 2016, the Georgia PSC voted to approve a settlement agreement (Vogtle Cost Settlement Agreement) resolving certain prudency matters in connection with the fifteenth VCM report. In December 2017, the Georgia PSC voted to approve (and issued its related order on January 11, 2018) Georgia Power's seventeenth VCM report, which included a recommendation to continue construction with Southern Nuclear as project manager and Bechtel serving as the primary construction contractor, and modified the Vogtle Cost Settlement Agreement. The Vogtle Cost Settlement Agreement, as modified by the January 11, 2018 order, resolved the following regulatory matters related to Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4: (i) none of the $3.3 billion of costs incurred through December 31, 2015 and reflected in the fourteenth VCM report should be disallowed from rate base on the basis of imprudence; (ii) the Contractor Settlement Agreement was reasonable and prudent and none of the amounts paid pursuant to the Contractor Settlement Agreement should be disallowed from rate base on the basis of imprudence; (iii) (a) capital costs incurred up to $5.68 billion would be presumed to be reasonable and prudent with the burden of proof on any party challenging such costs, (b) Georgia Power would have the burden to show that any capital costs above $5.68 billion were prudent, and (c) a revised capital cost forecast of $7.3 billion (after reflecting the impact of payments received under the Guarantee Settlement Agreement and related Customer Refunds) was found reasonable; (iv) construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 should be completed, with Southern Nuclear serving as project manager and Bechtel as primary contractor; (v) approved and deemed reasonable Georgia Power's revised schedule placing Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 in service in November 2021 and November 2022, respectively; (vi) confirmed that the revised cost forecast does not represent a cost cap and that prudence decisions on cost recovery will be made at a later date, consistent with applicable Georgia law; (vii) reduced the ROE used to calculate the NCCR tariff (a) from 10.95% (the ROE rate setting point authorized by the Georgia PSC in the 2013 ARP) to 10.00% effective January 1, 2016, (b) from 10.00% to 8.30%, effective January 1, 2020, and (c) from 8.30% to 5.30%, effective January 1, 2021 (provided that the ROE in no case will be less than Georgia Power's average cost of long-term debt); (viii) reduced the ROE used for AFUDC equity for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 from 10.00% to Georgia Power's average cost of long-term debt, effective January 1, 2018; and (ix) agreed that upon Unit 3 reaching commercial operation, retail base rates would be adjusted to include carrying costs on those capital costs deemed prudent in the Vogtle Cost Settlement Agreement. The January 11, 2018 order also stated that if Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 are not commercially operational by June 1, 2021 and June 1, 2022, respectively, the ROE used to calculate the NCCR tariff will be further reduced by 10 basis points each month (but not lower than Georgia Power's average cost of long-term debt) until the respective Unit is commercially operational. The ROE reductions negatively impacted earnings by approximately $100 million, $25 million, and $20 million in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively, and are estimated to have negative earnings impacts of approximately $75 million in 2019 and an aggregate of approximately $615 million from 2020 to 2022.In its January 11, 2018 order, the Georgia PSC also stated if other conditions change and assumptions upon which Georgia Power's seventeenth VCM report are based do not materialize, the Georgia PSC reserved the right to reconsider the decision to continue construction.On February 12, 2018, Georgia Interfaith Power & Light, Inc. (GIPL) and Partnership for Southern Equity, Inc. (PSE) filed a petition appealing the Georgia PSC's January 11, 2018 order with the Fulton County Superior Court. On March 8, 2018, Georgia Watch filed a similar appeal to the Fulton County Superior Court for judicial review of the Georgia PSC's decision and denial of Georgia Watch's motion for reconsideration. On December 21, 2018, the Fulton County Superior Court granted Georgia Power's motion to dismiss the two appeals. On January 9, 2019, GIPL, PSE, and Georgia Watch filed an appeal of this decision with the Georgia Court of Appeals. Georgia Power believes the appeal has no merit; however, an adverse outcome in the appeal combined with subsequent adverse action by the Georgia PSC could have a material impact on Southern Company's results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.In preparation for its nineteenth VCM filing, Georgia Power requested Southern Nuclear to perform a full cost reforecast for the project. This reforecast, performed prior to the nineteenth VCM filing, resulted in a $0.7 billion increase to the base capital cost forecast reported in the second quarter 2018. This base cost increase primarily resulted from changed assumptions related to the finalization of contract scopes and management responsibilities for Bechtel and over 60 subcontractors, labor productivity rates, and craft labor incentives, as well as the related levels of project management, oversight, and support, including field supervision and engineering support.Although Georgia Power believes these incremental costs are reasonable and necessary to complete the project and the Georgia PSC's order in the seventeenth VCM proceeding specifically states that the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 is not subject to a cost cap, Georgia Power did not seek rate recovery for these cost increases included in the current base capital cost forecast (or any related financing costs) in the nineteenth VCM report. In connection with future VCM filings, Georgia Power may request the Georgia PSC to evaluate costs currently included in the construction contingency estimate for rate recovery as and when they are appropriately included in the base capital cost forecast. After considering the significant level of uncertainty that exists regarding the future recoverability of costs included in the construction contingency estimate since the ultimate outcome of these matters is subject to the outcome of future assessments by management, as well as Georgia PSC decisions in these future regulatory proceedings, Georgia Power recorded a total pre-tax charge to income of $1.1 billion ($0.8 billion after II-47 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual Reporttax) in the second quarter 2018, which includes the total increase in the base capital cost forecast and construction contingency estimate.On August 31, 2018, Georgia Power filed its nineteenth VCM report with the Georgia PSC, which requested approval of $578 million of construction capital costs incurred from January 1, 2018 through June 30, 2018. On February 19, 2019, the Georgia PSC approved the nineteenth VCM, but deferred approval of $51.6 million of expenditures related to Georgia Power's portion of an administrative claim filed in the Westinghouse bankruptcy proceedings. Through the nineteenth VCM, the Georgia PSC has approved total construction capital costs incurred through June 30, 2018 of $5.4 billion (before $1.7 billion of payments received under the Guarantee Settlement Agreement and approximately $188 million in related Customer Refunds). In addition, the staff of the Georgia PSC requested, and Georgia Power agreed, to file its twentieth VCM report concurrently with the twenty-first VCM report by August 31, 2019.The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.DOE FinancingAt December 31, 2018, Georgia Power had borrowed $2.6 billion related to Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 costs through the Loan Guarantee Agreement and a multi-advance credit facility among Georgia Power, the DOE, and the FFB, which provides for borrowings of up to $3.46 billion, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. In September 2017, the DOE issued a conditional commitment to Georgia Power for up to approximately $1.67 billion in additional guaranteed loans under the Loan Guarantee Agreement. In September 2018, the DOE extended the conditional commitment to March 31, 2019. Any further extension must be approved by the DOE. Final approval and issuance of these additional loan guarantees by the DOE cannot be assured and are subject to the negotiation of definitive agreements, completion of due diligence by the DOE, receipt of any necessary regulatory approvals, and satisfaction of other conditions. See Note 8 to the financial statements under ""Long-term Debt – DOE Loan Guarantee Borrowings"" for additional information, including applicable covenants, events of default, mandatory prepayment events (including any decision not to continue construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4), and conditions to borrowing.The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.Income Tax MattersFederal Tax Reform LegislationIn December 2017, the Tax Reform Legislation was signed into law and became effective on January 1, 2018. The Tax Reform Legislation, among other things, reduced the federal corporate income tax rate to 21%, retained normalization provisions for public utility property and existing renewable energy incentives, and repealed the corporate alternative minimum tax. In addition, under the Tax Reform Legislation, NOLs generated after December 31, 2017 can no longer be carried back to previous tax years but can be carried forward indefinitely, with utilization limited to 80% of taxable income of the subsequent tax year. The projected reduction of the consolidated income tax liability resulting from the tax rate reduction also delays the expected utilization of existing tax credit carryforwards.Following the enactment of the Tax Reform Legislation, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin 118 – ""Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act"" (SAB 118), which provided for a measurement period of up to one year from the enactment date to complete accounting under GAAP for the tax effects of the legislation. Due to the complex and comprehensive nature of the enacted tax law changes and their application under GAAP, Southern Company considered all amounts recorded in the financial statements as a result of the Tax Reform Legislation ""provisional"" as discussed in SAB 118 and subject to revision prior to filing its 2017 tax return in the fourth quarter 2018. Southern Company recognized tax benefits of $30 million and $264 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively, for a total net tax benefit of $294 million as a result of the Tax Reform Legislation. In addition, in total, Southern Company recorded a $417 million decrease in regulatory assets and a $6.2 billion increase in regulatory liabilities as a result of the Tax Reform Legislation and $16 million of stranded excess deferred tax balances in AOCI at December 31, 2017 were adjusted through retained earnings in 2018. As of December 31, 2018, Southern Company considered the measurement of impacts from the Tax Reform Legislation on deferred income tax assets and liabilities, primarily due to the impact of the reduction of the corporate income tax rate, to be complete.However, the IRS continues to issue regulations that provide further interpretation and guidance on the law and each state's adoption of the provisions contained in the Tax Reform Legislation remains uncertain. In addition, the regulatory treatment of certain impacts of the Tax Reform Legislation is subject to the discretion of the FERC and each state's regulatory commission. The ultimate impact of these matters cannot be determined at this time. See Note 2 to the financial statements for additional information regarding the traditional electric operating companies' and the natural gas distribution utilities' rate filings, including II-48 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual Reportamounts returned to customers during 2018, to reflect the impacts of the Tax Reform Legislation. Also see FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY – ""Credit Rating Risk"" herein and Note 10 to the financial statements under ""Current and Deferred Income Taxes"" for additional information.Bonus DepreciationUnder the Tax Reform Legislation, projects with binding contracts prior to September 28, 2017 and placed in service after September 27, 2017 remain eligible for bonus depreciation under the PATH Act. The PATH Act allowed for 50% bonus depreciation for 2015 through 2017, 40% bonus depreciation for 2018, and 30% bonus depreciation for 2019 and certain long-lived assets placed in service in 2020. Based on provisional estimates, bonus depreciation is expected to result in positive cash flows of approximately $300 million for the 2018 tax year and approximately $130 million for the 2019 tax year. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.Tax CreditsThe Tax Reform Legislation retained the renewable energy incentives that were included in the PATH Act. The PATH Act allows for 30% ITC for solar projects that commence construction by December 31, 2019; 26% ITC for solar projects that commence construction in 2020; 22% ITC for solar projects that commence construction in 2021; and a permanent 10% ITC for solar projects that commence construction on or after January 1, 2022. In addition, the PATH Act allows for 100% PTC for wind projects that commenced construction in 2016; 80% PTC for wind projects that commenced construction in 2017; 60% PTC for wind projects that commenced construction in 2018 and 40% PTC for wind projects that commence construction in 2019. Wind projects commencing construction after 2019 will not be entitled to any PTCs. Southern Company has received ITCs and PTCs in connection with investments in solar, wind, and biomass facilities primarily at Southern Power and Georgia Power. See Note 1 to the financial statements under ""Income Taxes"" and Note 10 to the financial statements under ""Current and Deferred Income Taxes – Tax Credit Carryforwards"" for additional information regarding the utilization and amortization of credits and the tax benefit related to basis differences.Other MattersSouthern Company and its subsidiaries are involved in various other matters being litigated and regulatory matters that could affect future earnings. In addition, Southern Company and its subsidiaries are subject to certain claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. The business activities of Southern Company's subsidiaries are subject to extensive governmental regulation related to public health and the environment, such as laws and regulations governing air, water, land, and protection of other natural resources. Litigation over environmental issues and claims of various types, including property damage, personal injury, common law nuisance, and citizen enforcement of environmental laws and regulations, has occurred throughout the U.S. This litigation has included claims for damages alleged to have been caused by CO2 and other emissions, CCR, and alleged exposure to hazardous materials, and/or requests for injunctive relief in connection with such matters.The ultimate outcome of such pending or potential litigation or regulatory matters cannot be predicted at this time; however, for current proceedings not specifically reported herein or in Notes 2 and 3 to the financial statements, management does not anticipate that the ultimate liabilities, if any, arising from such current proceedings would have a material effect on Southern Company's financial statements. See Notes 2 and 3 to the financial statements for a discussion of various other contingencies, regulatory matters, and other matters being litigated which may affect future earnings potential.LitigationIn January 2017, a putative securities class action complaint was filed against Southern Company, certain of its officers, and certain former Mississippi Power officers in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia, Atlanta Division, by Monroe County Employees' Retirement System on behalf of all persons who purchased shares of Southern Company's common stock between April 25, 2012 and October 29, 2013. The complaint alleges that Southern Company, certain of its officers, and certain former Mississippi Power officers made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Kemper County energy facility in violation of certain provisions under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The complaint seeks, among other things, compensatory damages and litigation costs and attorneys' fees. In June 2017, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint that provided additional detail about their claims, increased the purported class period by one day, and added certain other former Mississippi Power officers as defendants. In July 2017, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the plaintiffs' amended complaint with prejudice, to which the plaintiffs filed an opposition in September 2017. On March 29, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia, Atlanta Division, issued an order granting, in part, the defendants' motion to dismiss. The court dismissed certain claims against certain officers of Southern Company and Mississippi Power and dismissed the allegations related to a number of the statements that plaintiffs challenged as being false or misleading. On April 26, 2018, the II-49 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual Reportdefendants filed a motion for reconsideration of the court's order, seeking dismissal of the remaining claims in the lawsuit. On August 10, 2018, the court denied the motion for reconsideration and denied a motion to certify the issue for interlocutory appeal.In February 2017, Jean Vineyard filed a shareholder derivative lawsuit and, in May 2017, Judy Mesirov filed a shareholder derivative lawsuit, each in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia. Each of these lawsuits names as defendants Southern Company, certain of its directors, certain of its officers, and certain former Mississippi Power officers. In August 2017, these two shareholder derivative lawsuits were consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia. The complaints allege that the defendants caused Southern Company to make false or misleading statements regarding the Kemper County energy facility cost and schedule. Further, the complaints allege that the defendants were unjustly enriched and caused the waste of corporate assets and also allege that the individual defendants violated their fiduciary duties. Each plaintiff seeks to recover, on behalf of Southern Company, unspecified actual damages and, on each plaintiff's own behalf, attorneys' fees and costs in bringing the lawsuit. Each plaintiff also seeks certain changes to Southern Company's corporate governance and internal processes. On April 25, 2018, the court entered an order staying this lawsuit until 30 days after the resolution of any dispositive motions or any settlement, whichever is earlier, in the putative securities class action.In May 2017, Helen E. Piper Survivor's Trust filed a shareholder derivative lawsuit in the Superior Court of Gwinnett County, State of Georgia that names as defendants Southern Company, certain of its directors, certain of its officers, and certain former Mississippi Power officers. The complaint alleges that the individual defendants, among other things, breached their fiduciary duties in connection with schedule delays and cost overruns associated with the construction of the Kemper County energy facility. The complaint further alleges that the individual defendants authorized or failed to correct false and misleading statements regarding the Kemper County energy facility schedule and cost and failed to implement necessary internal controls to prevent harm to Southern Company. The plaintiff seeks to recover, on behalf of Southern Company, unspecified actual damages and disgorgement of profits and, on its behalf, attorneys' fees and costs in bringing the lawsuit. The plaintiff also seeks certain unspecified changes to Southern Company's corporate governance and internal processes. On May 4, 2018, the court entered an order staying this lawsuit until 30 days after the resolution of any dispositive motions or any settlement, whichever is earlier, in the putative securities class action.On May 18, 2018, Southern Company and Mississippi Power received a notice of dispute and arbitration demand filed by Martin Product Sales, LLC (Martin) based on two agreements, both related to Kemper IGCC byproducts for which Mississippi Power provided termination notices in September 2017. Martin alleges breach of contract, breach of good faith and fair dealing, fraud and misrepresentation, and civil conspiracy and makes a claim for damages in the amount of approximately $143 million, as well as additional unspecified damages, attorney's fees, costs, and interest. In the first quarter 2019, Mississippi Power and Southern Company filed motions to dismiss.Southern Company believes these legal challenges have no merit; however, an adverse outcome in any of these proceedings could have an impact on Southern Company's results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. Southern Company will vigorously defend itself in these matters, the ultimate outcome of which cannot be determined at this time.Investments in Leveraged LeasesA subsidiary of Southern Holdings has several leveraged lease agreements, with original terms ranging up to 45 years, which relate to international and domestic energy generation, distribution, and transportation assets. Southern Company receives federal income tax deductions for depreciation and amortization, as well as interest on long-term debt related to these investments. Southern Company reviews all important lease assumptions at least annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that a change in assumptions has occurred or may occur. These assumptions include the effective tax rate, the residual value, the credit quality of the lessees, and the timing of expected tax cash flows. See Note 1 to the financial statements under ""Leveraged Leases"" for additional information.The ability of the lessees to make required payments to the Southern Holdings subsidiary is dependent on the operational performance of the assets. In 2017, the financial and operational performance of one of the lessees and the associated generation assets raised significant concerns about the short-term ability of the generation assets to produce cash flows sufficient to support ongoing operations and the lessee's contractual obligations and its ability to make the remaining semi-annual lease payments to the Southern Holdings subsidiary beginning in June 2018. As a result of operational improvements in 2018, the 2018 lease payments were paid in full. However, operational issues and the resulting cash liquidity challenges persist and significant concerns continue regarding the lessee's ability to make the remaining semi-annual lease payments. These operational challenges may also impact the expected residual value of the assets at the end of the lease term in 2047. If any future lease payment is not paid in full, the Southern Holdings subsidiary may be unable to make its corresponding payment to the holders of the underlying non-recourse debt related to the generation assets. Failure to make the required payment to the debtholders could represent an event of default that would give the debtholders the right to foreclose on, and take ownership of, the generation assets from the II-50 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual ReportSouthern Holdings subsidiary, in effect terminating the lease and resulting in the write-off of the related lease receivable, which would result in a reduction in net income of approximately $86 million after tax based on the lease receivable balance at December 31, 2018. Southern Company has evaluated the recoverability of the lease receivable and the expected residual value of the generation assets at the end of the lease under various scenarios and has concluded that its investment in the leveraged lease is not impaired at December 31, 2018. Southern Company will continue to monitor the operational performance of the underlying assets and evaluate the ability of the lessee to continue to make the required lease payments. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.Mississippi PowerIn conjunction with Southern Company's sale of Gulf Power, Mississippi Power and Gulf Power have committed to seek a restructuring of their 50% undivided ownership interests in Plant Daniel such that each of them would, after the restructuring, own 100% of a generating unit. On January 15, 2019, Gulf Power provided notice to Mississippi Power that Gulf Power will retire its share of the generating capacity of Plant Daniel on January 15, 2024. Mississippi Power has the option to purchase Gulf Power's ownership interest for $1 on January 15, 2024, provided that Mississippi Power exercises the option no later than 120 days prior to that date. Mississippi Power is assessing the potential operational and economic effects of Gulf Power's notice. The ultimate outcome of these matters remains subject to completion of Mississippi Power's evaluations and applicable regulatory approvals, including the FERC and the Mississippi PSC, and cannot now be determined. See Note 15 to the financial statements under ""Southern Company's Sale of Gulf Power"" for information regarding the sale of Gulf Power.Southern PowerOn January 29, 2019, Pacific Gas & Electric Company (PG&E) filed petitions to reorganize under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Southern Power, together with its noncontrolling partners, owns four solar facilities where PG&E is the energy off-taker for approximately 207 MWs of capacity under long-term PPAs. PG&E is also the transmission provider for these facilities and two of Southern Power's other solar facilities. Southern Power has evaluated the recoverability of its investments in these solar facilities under various scenarios, including selling the related energy into the competitive markets, and has concluded they are not impaired. At December 31, 2018, Southern Power had outstanding accounts receivables due from PG&E of $1 million related to the PPAs and $36 million related to the transmission interconnections. Southern Company does not expect a material impact to its financial statements if, as a result of the bankruptcy proceedings, PG&E does not perform in accordance with the PPAs or the terms of the PPAs are renegotiated; however, the ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.Southern Company GasA wholly-owned subsidiary of Southern Company Gas owns and operates a natural gas storage facility consisting of two salt dome caverns in Louisiana. Periodic integrity tests are required in accordance with rules of the Louisiana Department of Natural Resources (DNR). In August 2017, in connection with an ongoing integrity project, updated seismic mapping indicated the proximity of one of the caverns to the edge of the salt dome may be less than the required minimum and could result in Southern Company Gas retiring the cavern early. At December 31, 2018, the facility's property, plant, and equipment had a net book value of $109 million, of which the cavern itself represents approximately 20%. A potential early retirement of this cavern is dependent upon several factors including compliance with an order from the Louisiana DNR detailing the requirements to place the cavern back in service, which includes, among other things, obtaining core samples to determine the composition of the sheath surrounding the edge of the salt dome.The cavern continues to maintain its pressures and overall structural integrity. Southern Company Gas intends to monitor the cavern and comply with the Louisiana DNR order through 2020 and place the cavern back in service in 2021. These events were considered in connection with Southern Company Gas' annual long-lived asset impairment analysis, which determined there was no impairment as of December 31, 2018. Any changes in results of monitoring activities, rates at which expiring capacity contracts are re-contracted, timing of placing the cavern back in service, or Louisiana DNR requirements could trigger impairment. Further, early retirement of the cavern could trigger impairment of other long-lived assets associated with the natural gas storage facility. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time, but could have a significant impact on Southern Company's financial statements.ACCOUNTING POLICIESApplication of Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesSouthern Company prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP. Significant accounting policies are described in Notes 1, 5, and 6 to the financial statements. In the application of these policies, certain estimates are made that may II-51 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual Reporthave a material impact on Southern Company's results of operations and related disclosures. Different assumptions and measurements could produce estimates that are significantly different from those recorded in the financial statements. Senior management has reviewed and discussed the following critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of Southern Company's Board of Directors.Utility RegulationSouthern Company's traditional electric operating companies and natural gas distribution utilities, which collectively comprised approximately 85% of Southern Company's total operating revenues for 2018, are subject to retail regulation by their respective state PSCs or other applicable state regulatory agencies and wholesale regulation by the FERC. These regulatory agencies set the rates the traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities are permitted to charge customers based on allowable costs, including a reasonable ROE. As a result, the traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities apply accounting standards which require the financial statements to reflect the effects of rate regulation. Through the ratemaking process, the regulators may require the inclusion of costs or revenues in periods different than when they would be recognized by a non-regulated company. This treatment may result in the deferral of expenses and the recording of related regulatory assets based on anticipated future recovery through rates or the deferral of gains or creation of liabilities and the recording of related regulatory liabilities. The application of the accounting standards has a further effect on Southern Company's financial statements as a result of the estimates of allowable costs used in the ratemaking process. These estimates may differ from those actually incurred by the traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities; therefore, the accounting estimates inherent in specific costs such as depreciation, AROs, and pension and other postretirement benefits have less of a direct impact on Southern Company's results of operations and financial condition than they would on a non-regulated company. See Note 15 to the financial statements for information regarding the sale of Gulf Power and three of Southern Company Gas' natural gas distribution utilities.As reflected in Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Southern Company – Regulatory Assets and Liabilities,"" significant regulatory assets and liabilities have been recorded. Management reviews the ultimate recoverability of these regulatory assets and any requirement to refund these regulatory liabilities based on applicable regulatory guidelines and GAAP. However, adverse legislative, judicial, or regulatory actions could materially impact the amounts of such regulatory assets and liabilities and could adversely impact Southern Company's financial statements.Estimated Cost, Schedule, and Rate Recovery for the Construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4In 2016, the Georgia PSC approved the Vogtle Cost Settlement Agreement, which resolved certain prudency matters in connection with Georgia Power's fifteenth VCM report. In December 2017, the Georgia PSC approved Georgia Power's seventeenth VCM report, which included a recommendation to continue construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, with Southern Nuclear serving as project manager and Bechtel serving as the primary construction contractor, as well as a modification of the Vogtle Cost Settlement Agreement. The Georgia PSC's related order stated that under the modified Vogtle Cost Settlement Agreement, (i) none of the $3.3 billion of costs incurred through December 31, 2015 should be disallowed as imprudent; (ii) capital costs incurred up to $5.68 billion would be presumed to be reasonable and prudent with the burden of proof on any party challenging such costs; (iii) Georgia Power would have the burden of proof to show that any capital costs above $5.68 billion were prudent; (iv) Georgia Power's total project capital cost forecast of $7.3 billion (net of $1.7 billion received under the Guarantee Settlement Agreement and approximately $188 million in related Customer Refunds) was found reasonable and did not represent a cost cap; and (v) prudence decisions would be made subsequent to achieving fuel load for Unit 4.In its order, the Georgia PSC also stated if other conditions change and assumptions upon which Georgia Power's seventeenth VCM report are based do not materialize, the Georgia PSC reserved the right to reconsider the decision to continue construction.In the second quarter 2018, Georgia Power revised its base cost forecast and estimated contingency to complete construction and start-up of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 to $8.0 billion and $0.4 billion, respectively, for a total project capital cost forecast of $8.4 billion (net of $1.7 billion received under the Guarantee Settlement Agreement and approximately $188 million in related Customer Refunds). Although Georgia Power believes these incremental costs are reasonable and necessary to complete the project and the Georgia PSC's order in the seventeenth VCM proceeding specifically states that the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 is not subject to a cost cap, Georgia Power did not seek rate recovery for the $0.7 billion increase in costs included in the current base capital cost forecast in the nineteenth VCM report. In connection with future VCM filings, Georgia Power may request the Georgia PSC to evaluate costs currently included in the construction contingency estimate for rate recovery as and when they are appropriately included in the base capital cost forecast. After considering the significant level of uncertainty that exists regarding the future recoverability of costs included in the construction contingency estimate since the ultimate outcome of these matters is subject to the outcome of future assessments by management, as well as Georgia PSC decisions in these future II-52 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual Reportregulatory proceedings, Georgia Power recorded a total pre-tax charge to income of $1.1 billion ($0.8 billion after tax) in the second quarter 2018.Georgia Power's revised cost estimate reflects an expected in-service date of November 2021 for Unit 3 and November 2022 for Unit 4.As construction continues, challenges with management of contractors, subcontractors, and vendors; labor productivity, availability, and/or cost escalation; procurement, fabrication, delivery, assembly, and/or installation and testing, including any required engineering changes, of plant systems, structures, and components (some of which are based on new technology that only recently began initial operation in the global nuclear industry at this scale); or other issues could arise and change the projected schedule and estimated cost. Monthly construction production targets required to maintain the current project schedule will continue to increase significantly throughout 2019. To meet these increasing monthly targets, existing craft construction productivity must improve and additional craft laborers must be retained and deployed.Georgia Power and Southern Nuclear believe it is a leading practice in connection with a construction project of this size and complexity to periodically validate recent construction progress in comparison to the projected schedule and to verify and update quantities of commodities remaining to install, labor productivity, and forecasted staffing needs. This verification process, led by Southern Nuclear, was underway as of December 31, 2018 and is expected to be completed during the second quarter 2019. Georgia Power currently does not anticipate any material changes to the total estimated project capital cost forecast for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 or the expected in-service dates of November 2021 and November 2022, respectively, resulting from this verification process. However, the ultimate impact on cost and schedule, if any, will not be known until the verification process is completed. Georgia Power is required to report the results and any project impacts to the Georgia PSC by May 15, 2019.There have been technical and procedural challenges to the construction and licensing of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 at the federal and state level and additional challenges may arise. Processes are in place that are designed to assure compliance with the requirements specified in the Westinghouse Design Control Document and the combined construction and operating licenses, including inspections by Southern Nuclear and the NRC that occur throughout construction. As a result of such compliance processes, certain license amendment requests have been filed and approved or are pending before the NRC. Various design and other licensing-based compliance matters, including the timely resolution of ITAAC and the related approvals by the NRC, may arise, which may result in additional license amendments or require other resolution. If any license amendment requests or other licensing-based compliance issues are not resolved in a timely manner, there may be delays in the project schedule that could result in increased costs.The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time. Any extension of the in-service dates of November 2021 for Unit 3 and November 2022 for Unit 4 is currently estimated to result in additional base capital costs of approximately $50 million per month, based on Georgia Power's ownership interests, and AFUDC of approximately $12 million per month. While Georgia Power is not precluded from seeking recovery of any future capital cost forecast increase, management will ultimately determine whether or not to seek recovery. Any further changes to the capital cost forecast that are not expected to be recoverable through regulated rates will be required to be charged to income and such charges could be material.Given the significant complexity involved in estimating the future costs to complete construction and start-up of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 and the significant management judgment necessary to assess the related uncertainties surrounding future rate recovery of any projected cost increases, as well as the potential impact on Southern Company's results of operations and cash flows, Southern Company considers these items to be critical accounting estimates. See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Georgia Power – Nuclear Construction"" for additional information.Accounting for Income TaxesThe consolidated income tax provision and deferred income tax assets and liabilities, as well as any unrecognized tax benefits and valuation allowances, require significant judgment and estimates. These estimates are supported by historical tax return data, reasonable projections of taxable income, and interpretations of applicable tax laws and regulations across multiple taxing jurisdictions. The effective tax rate reflects the statutory tax rates and calculated apportionments for the various states in which the Southern Company system operates.Southern Company files a consolidated federal income tax return and various state income tax returns, some of which are combined or unitary. Under a joint consolidated income tax allocation agreement, each Southern Company subsidiary's current and deferred tax expense is computed on a stand-alone basis and no subsidiary is allocated more current expense than would be paid if it filed a separate income tax return. Certain deductions and credits can be limited at the consolidated or combined level resulting in NOL and tax credit carryforwards that would not otherwise result on a stand-alone basis. Utilization of NOL and tax credit carryforwards and the assessment of valuation allowances are based on significant judgment and extensive analysis of II-53 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual ReportSouthern Company's current financial position and result of operations, including currently available information about future years, to estimate when future taxable income will be realized.Current and deferred state income tax liabilities and assets are estimated based on laws of multiple states that determine the income to be apportioned to their jurisdictions. States utilize various formulas to calculate the apportionment of taxable income, primarily using sales, assets, or payroll within the jurisdiction compared to the consolidated totals. In addition, each state varies as to whether a stand-alone, combined, or unitary filing methodology is required. The calculation of deferred state taxes considers apportionment factors and filing methodologies that are expected to apply in future years. The apportionments and methodologies which are ultimately finalized in a manner inconsistent with expectations could have a material effect on Southern Company's financial statements.Given the significant judgment involved in estimating NOL and tax credit carryforwards and multi-state apportionments for all subsidiaries, Southern Company considers federal and state deferred income tax liabilities and assets to be critical accounting estimates.Asset Retirement ObligationsAROs are computed as the fair value of the estimated costs for an asset's future retirement and are recorded in the period in which the liability is incurred. The estimated costs are capitalized as part of the related long-lived asset and depreciated over the asset's useful life. In the absence of quoted market prices, AROs are estimated using present value techniques in which estimates of future cash outlays associated with the asset retirements are discounted using a credit-adjusted risk-free rate. Estimates of the timing and amounts of future cash outlays are based on projections of when and how the assets will be retired and the cost of future removal activities.The liability for AROs primarily relates to facilities that are subject to the CCR Rule and the related state rules, principally ash ponds, and the decommissioning of the Southern Company system's nuclear facilities – Alabama Power's Plant Farley and Georgia Power's ownership interests in Plant Hatch and Plant Vogtle Units 1 and 2. In addition, the Southern Company system has AROs related to various landfill sites, asbestos removal, mine reclamation, land restoration related to solar and wind facilities, and disposal of polychlorinated biphenyls in certain transformers.The traditional electric operating companies and Southern Company Gas also have identified retirement obligations, such as obligations related to certain electric transmission and distribution facilities, certain asbestos containing material within long-term assets not subject to ongoing repair and maintenance activities, certain wireless communication towers, the disposal of polychlorinated biphenyls in certain transformers, leasehold improvements, equipment on customer property, and property associated with the Southern Company system's rail lines and natural gas pipelines. However, liabilities for the removal of these assets have not been recorded as the fair value of the retirement obligations cannot be reasonably estimated. A liability for these retirement obligations will be recognized when sufficient information becomes available to support a reasonable estimation of the retirement obligation.The cost estimates for AROs related to the disposal of CCR are based on information using various assumptions related to closure and post-closure costs, timing of future cash outlays, inflation and discount rates, and the potential methods for complying with the CCR Rule. During 2018, Alabama Power and Georgia Power recorded increases of approximately $1.2 billion and $3.1 billion, respectively, to their AROs related to the disposal of CCR and increases of approximately $300 million and $130 million, respectively, to their AROs related to updated nuclear decommissioning cost site studies. Alabama Power's CCR-related update resulted from feasibility studies performed on ash ponds in use at the plants it operates, which indicated that additional closure costs, primarily related to increases in estimated ash volume, water management requirements, and design revisions, will be required to close these ash ponds under the planned closure-in-place methodology. Georgia Power's CCR-related update resulted from a strategic assessment which indicated additional closure costs will be required to close its ash ponds, primarily due to changes in closure strategies, the estimated amount of ash to be excavated, and additional water management requirements necessary to support closure strategies. The traditional electric operating companies expect to periodically update their ARO cost estimates. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – ""Environmental Matters – Environmental Laws and Regulations – Coal Combustion Residuals"" herein and Note 6 to the financial statements for additional information.Given the significant judgment involved in estimating AROs, Southern Company considers the liabilities for AROs to be critical accounting estimates.Pension and Other Postretirement BenefitsSouthern Company's calculation of pension and other postretirement benefits expense is dependent on a number of assumptions. These assumptions include discount rates, healthcare cost trend rates, expected long-term return on plan assets, mortality rates, expected salary and wage increases, and other factors. Components of pension and other postretirement benefits expense include II-54 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual Reportinterest and service cost on the pension and other postretirement benefit plans, expected return on plan assets, and amortization of certain unrecognized costs and obligations. Actual results that differ from the assumptions utilized are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, generally affect recognized expense and the recorded obligation in future periods. While Southern Company believes that the assumptions used are appropriate, differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions would affect its pension and other postretirement benefit costs and obligations.Key elements in determining Southern Company's pension and other postretirement benefit expense are the expected long-term return on plan assets and the discount rate used to measure the benefit plan obligations and the periodic benefit plan expense for future periods. The expected long-term return on pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets is based on Southern Company's investment strategy, historical experience, and expectations for long-term rates of return that consider external actuarial advice. Southern Company determines the long-term return on plan assets by applying the long-term rate of expected returns on various asset classes to Southern Company's target asset allocation. For purposes of determining its liability related to the pension and other postretirement benefit plans, Southern Company discounts the future related cash flows using a single-point discount rate for each plan developed from the weighted average of market-observed yields for high quality fixed income securities with maturities that correspond to expected benefit payments.The following table illustrates the sensitivity to changes in Southern Company's long-term assumptions with respect to the discount rate, salary increases, and the long-term rate of return on plan assets:Change in AssumptionIncrease/(Decrease) in Total Benefit Expense for 2019 Increase/(Decrease) in Projected Obligation for Pension Plan at December 31, 2018 Increase/(Decrease) in Projected Obligation for Other Postretirement Benefit Plans at December 31, 2018 (in millions)25 basis point change in discount rate$37/$(36) $434/$(411) $50/$(48)25 basis point change in salaries$11/$(11) $105/$(101) $–/$–25 basis point change in long-term return on plan assets$33/$(33) N/A N/AN/A – Not applicableSee Note 11 to the financial statements for additional information regarding pension and other postretirement benefits. Goodwill and Other Intangible AssetsThe acquisition method of accounting requires the assets acquired and liabilities assumed to be recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective estimated fair values. Southern Company recognizes goodwill as of the acquisition date, as a residual over the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired. Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis in the fourth quarter of the year as well as on an interim basis as events and changes in circumstances occur. Primarily as a result of the acquisitions of Southern Company Gas and PowerSecure in 2016, goodwill totaled approximately $5.3 billion at December 31, 2018. As a result of the Southern Company Gas Dispositions, goodwill was reduced by $910 million during 2018. In addition, Southern Company Gas recorded a $42 million goodwill impairment charge in 2018 in contemplation of the sale of Pivotal Home Solutions.Definite-lived intangible assets acquired are amortized over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets to reflect the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible assets are consumed. Whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the intangible assets may not be recoverable, the intangible assets will be reviewed for impairment. Primarily as a result of the acquisitions of Southern Company Gas and PowerSecure and PPA fair value adjustments resulting from Southern Power's acquisitions, other intangible assets, net of amortization totaled approximately $613 million at December 31, 2018.The judgments made in determining the estimated fair value assigned to each class of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as well as asset lives, can significantly impact Southern Company's results of operations. Fair values and useful lives are determined based on, among other factors, the expected future period of benefit of the asset, the various characteristics of the asset, and projected cash flows. As the determination of an asset's fair value and useful life involves management making certain estimates and because these estimates form the basis for the determination of whether or not an impairment charge should be recorded, Southern Company considers these estimates to be critical accounting estimates.See Note 1 to the financial statements under ""Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets and Liabilities"" for additional information regarding Southern Company's goodwill and other intangible assets and Note 15 to the financial statements for additional II-55 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual Reportinformation related to Southern Company's 2016 acquisitions of Southern Company Gas and PowerSecure, as well as the Southern Company Gas Dispositions.Derivatives and Hedging ActivitiesDerivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheets as either assets or liabilities measured at their fair value, unless the transactions qualify for the normal purchases or normal sales scope exception and are instead subject to traditional accrual accounting. For those transactions that do not qualify as a normal purchase or normal sale, changes in the derivatives' fair values are recognized concurrently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met. If the derivatives meet those criteria, derivative gains and losses offset related results of the hedged item in the income statement in the case of a fair value hedge, or gains and losses are deferred in OCI until the hedged transaction affects earnings in the case of a cash flow hedge. Certain subsidiaries of Southern Company enter into energy-related derivatives that are designated as regulatory hedges where gains and losses are initially recorded as regulatory liabilities and assets and then are included in fuel expense as the underlying fuel is used in operations and ultimately recovered through billings to customers.Southern Company uses derivative instruments to reduce the impact to the results of operations due to the risk of changes in the price of natural gas, to manage fuel hedging programs per guidelines of state regulatory agencies, and to mitigate residual changes in the price of electricity, weather, interest rates, and foreign currency exchange rates. The fair value of commodity derivative instruments used to manage exposure to changing prices reflects the estimated amounts that Southern Company would receive or pay to terminate or close the contracts at the reporting date. To determine the fair value of the derivative instruments, Southern Company utilizes market data or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the derivative asset or liability, including assumptions about risk and the risks inherent in the inputs of the valuation technique.Southern Company classifies derivative assets and liabilities based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment and may affect the valuation of fair value assets and liabilities and their placement within the fair value hierarchy. The determination of the fair value of the derivative instruments incorporates various required factors. These factors include:•the creditworthiness of the counterparties involved and the impact of credit enhancements (such as cash deposits and letters of credit);•events specific to a given counterparty; and•the impact of Southern Company's nonperformance risk on its liabilities.Given the assumptions used in pricing the derivative asset or liability, Southern Company considers the valuation of derivative assets and liabilities a critical accounting estimate. See FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY – ""Market Price Risk"" herein and Note 14 to the financial statements for more information.Contingent ObligationsSouthern Company is subject to a number of federal and state laws and regulations as well as other factors and conditions that subject it to environmental, litigation, and other risks. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL herein and Notes 2 and 3 to the financial statements for more information regarding certain of these contingencies. Southern Company periodically evaluates its exposure to such risks and records reserves for those matters where a non-tax-related loss is considered probable and reasonably estimable. The adequacy of reserves can be significantly affected by external events or conditions that can be unpredictable; thus, the ultimate outcome of such matters could materially affect Southern Company's results of operations, cash flows, or financial condition.Recently Issued Accounting StandardsSee Note 1 to the financial statements under ""Recently Adopted Accounting Standards"" for additional information.In 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) (ASU 2016-02). ASU 2016-02 requires lessees to recognize on the balance sheet a lease liability and a right-of-use asset for all leases. ASU 2016-02 also changes the recognition, measurement, and presentation of expense associated with leases and provides clarification regarding the identification of certain components of contracts that would represent a lease. The accounting required by lessors is relatively unchanged and there is no change to the accounting for existing leveraged leases. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 and Southern Company adopted the new standard effective January 1, 2019.Southern Company elected the transition methodology provided by ASU No. 2018-11, Leases (Topic 842): Targeted Improvements, whereby the requirements of ASU 2016-02 are applied on a prospective basis as of the adoption date of January 1, 2019, without restating prior periods. Southern Company elected the package of practical expedients provided by ASU 2016-02 II-56 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual Reportthat allows prior determinations of whether existing contracts are, or contain, leases and the classification of existing leases to continue without reassessment. Additionally, Southern Company applied the use-of-hindsight practical expedient in determining lease terms as of the date of adoption and elected the practical expedient that allows existing land easements not previously accounted for as leases not to be reassessed. Southern Company also made accounting policy elections to account for short-term leases in all asset classes as off-balance sheet leases and combined lease and non-lease components in the computations of lease obligations and right-of-use assets for most asset classes.The Southern Company system completed the implementation of a new application to track and account for its leases and updated its internal controls and accounting policies to support the accounting for leases under ASU 2016-02. The Southern Company system completed its lease inventory and determined its most significant leases involve PPAs, real estate, and communication towers where certain of Southern Company's subsidiaries are the lessee and PPAs where certain of Southern Company's subsidiaries are the lessor. In the first quarter 2019, the adoption of ASU 2016-02 resulted in recording lease liabilities and right-of-use assets on Southern Company's balance sheet each totaling approximately $2.0 billion, with no impact on Southern Company's statement of income.FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITYOverviewEarnings in all periods presented were negatively affected by charges associated with plants under construction; however, Southern Company's financial condition remained stable at December 31, 2018.The Southern Company system's cash requirements primarily consist of funding ongoing operations, common stock dividends, capital expenditures, and debt maturities. The Southern Company system's capital expenditures and other investing activities include investments to meet projected long-term demand requirements, including to build new electric generation facilities, to maintain existing electric generation facilities, to comply with environmental regulations including adding environmental modifications to certain existing electric generating units and closures of ash ponds, to expand and improve electric transmission and distribution facilities, to update and expand natural gas distribution systems, and for restoration following major storms. Operating cash flows provide a substantial portion of the Southern Company system's cash needs. For the three-year period from 2019 through 2021, Southern Company's projected common stock dividends, capital expenditures, and debt maturities are expected to exceed operating cash flows. Southern Company plans to finance future cash needs in excess of its operating cash flows primarily by accessing borrowings from financial institutions and through debt and equity issuances in the capital markets. Southern Company intends to continue to monitor its access to short-term and long-term capital markets as well as bank credit arrangements to meet future capital and liquidity needs. See ""Sources of Capital,"" ""Financing Activities,"" and ""Capital Requirements and Contractual Obligations"" herein for additional information.Southern Company's investments in the qualified pension plans and the nuclear decommissioning trust funds decreased in value at December 31, 2018 as compared to December 31, 2017. No contributions to the qualified pension plan were made for the year ended December 31, 2018 and no mandatory contributions to the qualified pension plans are anticipated during 2019. See ""Contractual Obligations"" herein and Notes 6 and 11 to the financial statements under ""Nuclear Decommissioning"" and ""Pension Plans,"" respectively, for additional information.Net cash provided from operating activities in 2018 totaled $6.9 billion, an increase of $0.6 billion from 2017. The increase in net cash provided from operating activities was primarily due to the timing of vendor payments and increased fuel cost recovery. Net cash provided from operating activities in 2017 totaled $6.4 billion, an increase of $1.5 billion from 2016. Significant changes in operating cash flow for 2017 as compared to 2016 included increases of $1.2 billion related to operating activities of Southern Company Gas, which was acquired on July 1, 2016, and $1.0 billion related to voluntary contributions to the qualified pension plan in 2016, partially offset by the timing of vendor payments.Net cash used for investing activities in 2018, 2017, and 2016 totaled $5.8 billion, $7.2 billion, and $20.0 billion, respectively. The cash used for investing activities in 2018 was primarily due to the traditional electric operating companies' installation of equipment to comply with environmental standards and construction of electric generation, transmission, and distribution facilities and capital expenditures for Southern Company Gas' infrastructure replacement programs, partially offset by proceeds from the sale transactions described in Note 15 to the financial statements. The cash used for investing activities in 2017 was primarily due to the traditional electric operating companies' installation of equipment to comply with environmental standards and construction of electric generation, transmission, and distribution facilities, capital expenditures for Southern Company Gas' infrastructure replacement programs, and Southern Power's renewable acquisitions. The cash used for investing activities in 2016 was primarily due to the closing of the Merger, the acquisition of PowerSecure, Southern Company Gas' investment in SNG, the traditional electric operating companies' construction of electric generation, transmission, and distribution facilities and II-57 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual Reportinstallation of equipment at electric generating facilities to comply with environmental standards, and Southern Power's acquisitions and construction of renewable facilities and a natural gas facility.Net cash used for financing activities totaled $1.8 billion in 2018 primarily due to net redemptions and repurchases of long-term debt, common stock dividend payments, and a decrease in commercial paper borrowings, partially offset by net issuances of short-term bank debt, proceeds from Southern Power's sales of non-controlling equity interests in entities indirectly owning substantially all of its solar facilities and eight of its wind facilities, and the issuance of common stock. Net cash provided from financing activities totaled $1.0 billion in 2017 primarily due to net issuances of long-term and short-term debt, partially offset by common stock dividend payments. Net cash provided from financing activities totaled $15.7 billion in 2016 primarily due to issuances of long-term debt and common stock associated with completing the Merger and funding the subsidiaries' continuous construction programs, Southern Power's acquisitions, and Southern Company Gas' investment in SNG, partially offset by redemptions of long-term debt and common stock dividend payments. Fluctuations in cash flow from financing activities vary from year to year based on capital needs and the maturity or redemption of securities.Significant balance sheet changes in 2018 included the reclassification of $5.7 billion and $3.3 billion in total assets and liabilities held for sale, respectively, primarily associated with Gulf Power, as well as decreases of $3.0 billion and $0.4 billion in total assets and liabilities, respectively, associated with the sales described in Note 15 to the financial statements under ""Southern Power"" and ""Southern Company Gas."" Also see Note 15 to the financial statements under ""Southern Company's Sale of Gulf Power"" and ""Assets Held for Sale"" for additional information. After adjusting for these changes, other significant balance sheet changes included an increase of $7.1 billion in total property, plant, and equipment primarily related to the $4.7 billion increase in AROs at Alabama Power and Georgia Power, as well as the traditional electric operating companies' installation of equipment to comply with environmental standards and construction of electric generation, transmission, and distribution facilities and Southern Company Gas' capital expenditures for infrastructure replacement programs, partially offset by the second quarter 2018 charge related to the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4; a decrease of $3.1 billion in long-term debt (including amounts due within one year) resulting from the repayment of long-term debt; an increase of $3.0 billion in noncontrolling interests at Southern Power as a result of sales of interests in entities indirectly owning substantially all of its solar facilities and eight of its wind facilities; and an increase of $1.9 billion in other regulatory assets, deferred primarily related to AROs at Georgia Power. See Notes 2 and 15 to the financial statements under ""Georgia Power – Nuclear Construction"" and ""Southern Power – Sales of Renewable Facility Interests,"" respectively, as well as Notes 6 and 8 to the financial statements and ""Financing Activities"" herein for additional information.At the end of 2018, the market price of Southern Company's common stock was $43.92 per share (based on the closing price as reported on the NYSE) and the book value was $23.91 per share, representing a market-to-book value ratio of 184%, compared to $48.09, $23.99, and 201%, respectively, at the end of 2017.Southern Company's consolidated ratio of common equity to total capitalization plus short-term debt was 32.5% and 31.5% at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. See Note 8 to the financial statements for additional information.Sources of CapitalSouthern Company intends to meet its future capital needs through operating cash flows, borrowings from financial institutions, and debt and equity issuances in the capital markets. Equity capital can be provided from any combination of Southern Company's stock plans, private placements, or public offerings. The amount and timing of additional equity and debt issuances in 2019, as well as in subsequent years, will be contingent on Southern Company's investment opportunities and the Southern Company system's capital requirements and will depend upon prevailing market conditions and other factors. See ""Capital Requirements and Contractual Obligations"" herein for additional information.Except as described herein, the traditional electric operating companies, Southern Power, and Southern Company Gas plan to obtain the funds required for construction and other purposes from operating cash flows, external security issuances, borrowings from financial institutions, and equity contributions or loans from Southern Company. Southern Power also plans to utilize tax equity partnership contributions, as well as funds resulting from its pending sale of Plant Mankato. However, the amount, type, and timing of any future financings, if needed, will depend upon prevailing market conditions, regulatory approval, and other factors. See Note 15 to the financial statements under ""Southern Power – Sales of Natural Gas Plants"" herein for additional information.In addition, in 2014, Georgia Power entered into the Loan Guarantee Agreement with the DOE, under which the proceeds of borrowings may be used to reimburse Georgia Power for Eligible Project Costs incurred in connection with its construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Under the Loan Guarantee Agreement, the DOE agreed to guarantee borrowings of up to $3.46 billion (not to exceed 70% of Eligible Project Costs) to be made by Georgia Power under a multi-advance credit facility (FFB Credit Facility) among Georgia Power, the DOE, and the FFB. At December 31, 2018, Georgia Power had borrowed $2.6 billion under II-58 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual Reportthe FFB Credit Facility. In July 2017, Georgia Power entered into an amendment to the Loan Guarantee Agreement, which provides that further advances are conditioned upon the DOE's approval of any agreements entered into in replacement of the Vogtle 3 and 4 Agreement and satisfaction of certain other conditions.In September 2017, the DOE issued a conditional commitment to Georgia Power for up to approximately $1.67 billion of additional guaranteed loans under the Loan Guarantee Agreement. This conditional commitment expires on March 31, 2019, subject to any further extension approved by the DOE. Final approval and issuance of these additional loan guarantees by the DOE cannot be assured and are subject to the negotiation of definitive agreements, completion of due diligence by the DOE, receipt of any necessary regulatory approvals, and satisfaction of other conditions. See Note 8 to the financial statements under ""Long-term Debt – DOE Loan Guarantee Borrowings"" for additional information regarding the Loan Guarantee Agreement, including applicable covenants, events of default, mandatory prepayment events (including any decision not to continue construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4), and additional conditions to borrowing. Also see Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Georgia Power – Nuclear Construction"" for additional information regarding Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4.The issuance of securities by the traditional electric operating companies and Nicor Gas is generally subject to the approval of the applicable state PSC or other applicable state regulatory agency. The issuance of all securities by Mississippi Power and short-term securities by Georgia Power is generally subject to regulatory approval by the FERC. Additionally, with respect to the public offering of securities, Southern Company and certain of its subsidiaries file registration statements with the SEC under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (1933 Act). The amounts of securities authorized by the appropriate regulatory authorities, as well as the securities registered under the 1933 Act, are continuously monitored and appropriate filings are made to ensure flexibility in the capital markets.Southern Company, each traditional electric operating company, and Southern Power generally obtain financing separately without credit support from any affiliate. The Southern Company system does not maintain a centralized cash or money pool. Therefore, funds of each company are not commingled with funds of any other company in the Southern Company system.In addition, Southern Company Gas Capital obtains external financing for Southern Company Gas and its subsidiaries, other than Nicor Gas, which obtains financing separately without credit support from any affiliates. Nicor Gas' commercial paper program supports its working capital needs as Nicor Gas is not permitted to make money pool loans to affiliates. All of the other Southern Company Gas subsidiaries benefit from Southern Company Gas Capital's commercial paper program.See Note 8 to the financial statements under ""Bank Credit Arrangements"" for additional information.At December 31, 2018, Southern Company's current liabilities exceeded current assets by $4.7 billion, primarily due to $3.2 billion of long-term debt that is due within one year (including approximately $1.3 billion at the parent company, $0.2 billion at Alabama Power, $0.6 billion at Georgia Power, $0.6 billion at Southern Power, and $0.4 billion at Southern Company Gas) and $2.9 billion of notes payable (including approximately $1.8 billion at the parent company, $0.3 billion at Georgia Power, $0.1 billion at Southern Power, and $0.7 billion at Southern Company Gas). Subsequent to December 31, 2018, using proceeds from the sale of Gulf Power, the Southern Company parent entity repaid $0.7 billion of its long-term debt due within one year and all $1.8 billion of its notes payable at December 31, 2018. See ""Financing Activities"" herein for additional information. To meet short-term cash needs and contingencies, the Southern Company system has substantial cash flow from operating activities and access to capital markets and financial institutions. Southern Company, the traditional electric operating companies, Southern Power, and Southern Company Gas intend to utilize operating cash flows, as well as commercial paper, lines of credit, bank notes, and securities issuances, as market conditions permit, as well as, under certain circumstances for the traditional electric operating companies, Southern Power, and Southern Company Gas, equity contributions and/or loans from Southern Company to meet their short-term capital needs.II-59 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual ReportAt December 31, 2018, Southern Company and its subsidiaries had approximately $1.4 billion of cash and cash equivalents. Committed credit arrangements with banks at December 31, 2018 were as follows: Expires Executable Term Loans Expires Within One YearCompany201920202022 Total Unused(d) OneYear TwoYears Term Out No Term Out (in millions)Southern Company(a)$— $— $2,000 $2,000 $1,999 $— $— $— $—Alabama Power33 500 800 1,333 1,333 — — — 33Georgia Power— — 1,750 1,750 1,736 — — — —Mississippi Power100 — — 100 100 — — — 100Southern Power(b)— — 750 750 727 — — — —Southern Company Gas(c)— — 1,900 1,900 1,895 — — — —Other30 — — 30 30 — — — 30Southern Company Consolidated(e)$163 $500 $7,200 $7,863 $7,820 $— $— $— $163(a)Represents the Southern Company parent entity.(b)Does not include Southern Power Company's $120 million continuing letter of credit facility for standby letters of credit expiring in 2021, of which $17 million was unused at December 31, 2018. Southern Power's subsidiaries are not parties to its bank credit arrangement.(c)Southern Company Gas, as the parent entity, guarantees the obligations of Southern Company Gas Capital, which is the borrower of $1.4 billion of this arrangement. Southern Company Gas' committed credit arrangement also includes $500 million for which Nicor Gas is the borrower and which is restricted for working capital needs of Nicor Gas. Pursuant to this multi-year credit arrangement, the allocations between Southern Company Gas Capital and Nicor Gas may be adjusted.(d)Amounts used are for letters of credit.(e) Excludes $280 million of committed credit arrangements of Gulf Power, which was sold on January 1, 2019. See Note 15 to the financial statements under ""Southern Company's Sale of Gulf Power"" for additional information.See Note 8 to the financial statements under ""Bank Credit Arrangements"" for additional information.Most of these bank credit arrangements, as well as the term loan arrangements of Alabama Power and Southern Power Company, contain covenants that limit debt levels and contain cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions to other indebtedness (including guarantee obligations) that are restricted only to the indebtedness of the individual company. Such cross-default provisions to other indebtedness would trigger an event of default if the applicable borrower defaulted on indebtedness or guarantee obligations over a specified threshold. Such cross-acceleration provisions to other indebtedness would trigger an event of default if the applicable borrower defaulted on indebtedness, the payment of which was then accelerated. At December 31, 2018, Southern Company, the traditional electric operating companies, Southern Power Company, Southern Company Gas, and Nicor Gas were in compliance with all such covenants. None of the bank credit arrangements contain material adverse change clauses at the time of borrowings.Subject to applicable market conditions, Southern Company and its subsidiaries expect to renew or replace their bank credit arrangements as needed, prior to expiration. In connection therewith, Southern Company and its subsidiaries may extend the maturity dates and/or increase or decrease the lending commitments thereunder.A portion of the unused credit with banks is allocated to provide liquidity support to the revenue bonds of the traditional electric operating companies and the commercial paper programs of Southern Company, the traditional electric operating companies, Southern Power Company, Southern Company Gas, and Nicor Gas. The amount of variable rate revenue bonds of the traditional electric operating companies outstanding requiring liquidity support at December 31, 2018 was approximately $1.6 billion, which included $82 million related to Gulf Power. In addition, at December 31, 2018, the traditional electric operating companies had approximately $403 million of revenue bonds outstanding that are required to be remarketed within the next 12 months, which included $58 million related to Gulf Power. See Note 15 to the financial statements under ""Southern Company's Sale of Gulf Power"" for information regarding the sale of Gulf Power on January 1, 2019. Subsequent to December 31, 2018, Georgia Power redeemed approximately $108 million of obligations related to outstanding variable rate pollution control revenue bonds.Southern Company, Alabama Power, Georgia Power, Southern Power Company, Southern Company Gas, Nicor Gas, and SEGCO make short-term borrowings primarily through commercial paper programs that have the liquidity support of the committed bank credit arrangements described above.

The proceeds of this loan, together with the proceeds of Mississippi Power's $600 million senior notes issuances, were used to repay Mississippi Power's $900 million unsecured floating rate term loan.In October 2018, Mississippi Power completed the redemption of all 334,210 outstanding shares of its preferred stock (as well as related depositary shares), with an aggregate par value of approximately $33.4 million.In May 2018, Southern Power entered into two short-term floating rate bank loans, each for an aggregate principal amount of $100 million, which bear interest based on one-month LIBOR. In November 2018, Southern Power repaid one of these short-term loans.During 2018, Southern Power received approximately $148 million of third-party tax equity related to certain of its renewable facilities. See Note 15 to the financial statements under ""Southern Power"" for additional information.Prior to its sale, in the second quarter 2018, Pivotal Utility Holdings caused $200 million aggregate principal amount of gas facility revenue bonds to be redeemed.In May 2018, Southern Company Gas Capital borrowed $95 million pursuant to a short-term uncommitted bank credit arrangement, guaranteed by Southern Company Gas, bearing interest at a rate agreed upon by Southern Company Gas Capital and the bank from time to time and payable on no less than 30 days' demand by the bank. In July 2018, Southern Company Gas Capital repaid this loan.Other long-term debt issuances for Southern Company Gas include the issuance by Nicor Gas of $300 million aggregate principal amount of first mortgage bonds in a private placement, of which $100 million was issued in August 2018 and $200 million was issued in November 2018.In addition to any financings that may be necessary to meet capital requirements and contractual obligations, Southern Company and its subsidiaries plan to continue, when economically feasible, a program to retire higher-cost securities and replace these obligations with lower-cost capital if market conditions permit.Credit Rating RiskAt December 31, 2018, Southern Company and its subsidiaries did not have any credit arrangements that would require material changes in payment schedules or terminations as a result of a credit rating downgrade.There are certain contracts that could require collateral, but not accelerated payment, in the event of a credit rating change of certain subsidiaries to BBB and/or Baa2 or below. These contracts are for physical electricity and natural gas purchases and sales, fuel purchases, fuel transportation and storage, energy price risk management, transmission, interest rate management, and construction of new generation at Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4.II-63 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual ReportThe maximum potential collateral requirements under these contracts at December 31, 2018 were as follows:Credit RatingsMaximumPotentialCollateralRequirements(a) (in millions)At BBB and/or Baa2$30At BBB- and/or Baa3$542At BB+ and/or Ba1(b)$2,176(a)Includes potential collateral requirements related to Gulf Power of $111 million and $221 million at a credit rating of BBB- and/or Baa3 and BB+ and/or Ba1, respectively. See Note 15 to the financial statements under ""Southern Company's Sale of Gulf Power"" for information regarding the sale of Gulf Power on January 1, 2019.(b)Any additional credit rating downgrades at or below BB- and/or Ba3 could increase collateral requirements up to an additional $38 million.Generally, collateral may be provided by a Southern Company guaranty, letter of credit, or cash. Additionally, a credit rating downgrade could impact the ability of Southern Company and its subsidiaries to access capital markets and would be likely to impact the cost at which they do so.On February 26, 2018, Moody's revised its rating outlook for Mississippi Power from stable to positive. On August 8, 2018, Moody's upgraded Mississippi Power's senior unsecured rating to Baa3 from Ba1 and maintained the positive rating outlook.On February 28, 2018, Fitch removed Mississippi Power from rating watch negative and revised its rating outlook from stable to positive.Also on February 28, 2018, Fitch downgraded the senior unsecured long-term debt rating of Southern Company to BBB+ from A- with a stable outlook and of Georgia Power to A from A+ with a negative outlook. On August 9, 2018, Fitch downgraded the senior unsecured long-term debt rating of Georgia Power to A- from A.On March 14, 2018, S&P upgraded the senior unsecured long-term debt rating of Mississippi Power to A- from BBB+. The outlook remained negative.On August 8, 2018, Moody's downgraded the senior unsecured debt rating of Georgia Power to Baa1 from A3.On September 28, 2018, Moody's revised its rating outlooks for Southern Company, Alabama Power, and Georgia Power from negative to stable.Also on September 28, 2018, Fitch assigned a negative rating outlook to the ratings of Southern Company and its subsidiaries (excluding Mississippi Power).As a result of the Tax Reform Legislation, certain financial metrics, such as the funds from operations to debt percentage, used by the credit rating agencies to assess Southern Company and its subsidiaries may be negatively impacted. Southern Company and most of its regulated subsidiaries have taken actions to mitigate the resulting impacts, which, among other alternatives, include adjusting capital structure. Absent actions by Southern Company and its subsidiaries that fully mitigate the impacts, the credit ratings of Southern Company and certain of its subsidiaries could be negatively affected. See Note 2 to the financial statements for additional information related to state PSC or other regulatory agency actions related to the Tax Reform Legislation, including approvals of capital structure adjustments for Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and Atlanta Gas Light by their respective state PSCs, which are expected to help mitigate the potential adverse impacts to certain of their credit metrics.Market Price Risk The Southern Company system is exposed to market risks, including commodity price risk, interest rate risk, weather risk, and occasionally foreign currency exchange rate risk. To manage the volatility attributable to these exposures, the applicable company nets the exposures, where possible, to take advantage of natural offsets and enters into various derivative transactions for the remaining exposures pursuant to the applicable company's policies in areas such as counterparty exposure and risk management practices. Southern Company Gas' wholesale gas operations use various contracts in its commercial activities that generally meet the definition of derivatives. For the traditional electric operating companies, Southern Power, and Southern Company Gas' other businesses, each company's policy is that derivatives are to be used primarily for hedging purposes and mandates strict adherence to all applicable risk management policies. Derivative positions are monitored using techniques including, but not limited to, market valuation, value at risk, stress testing, and sensitivity analysis.II-64 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual ReportTo mitigate future exposure to a change in interest rates, Southern Company and certain of its subsidiaries enter into derivatives that have been designated as hedges. Derivatives that have been designated as hedges outstanding at December 31, 2018 have a notional amount of $2.0 billion and are intended to mitigate interest rate volatility related to existing fixed rate obligations. The weighted average interest rate on $5.8 billion of long-term variable interest rate exposure at December 31, 2018 was 3.02%. If Southern Company sustained a 100 basis point change in interest rates for all long-term variable interest rate exposure, the change would affect annualized interest expense by approximately $58 million at December 31, 2018. See Note 1 to the financial statements under ""Financial Instruments"" and Note 14 to the financial statements for additional information.Southern Power Company had foreign currency denominated debt of €1.1 billion at December 31, 2018. Southern Power Company has mitigated its exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk through the use of foreign currency swaps converting all interest and principal payments to fixed-rate U.S. dollars.Due to cost-based rate regulation and other various cost recovery mechanisms, the traditional electric operating companies and natural gas distribution utilities continue to have limited exposure to market volatility in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, commodity fuel prices, and prices of electricity. In addition, Southern Power's exposure to market volatility in commodity fuel prices and prices of electricity is limited because its long-term sales contracts shift substantially all fuel cost responsibility to the purchaser. However, Southern Power has been and may continue to be exposed to market volatility in energy-related commodity prices as a result of uncontracted generating capacity. To mitigate residual risks relative to movements in electricity prices, the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power may enter into physical fixed-price contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity through the wholesale electricity market and, to a lesser extent, financial hedge contracts for natural gas purchases; however, a significant portion of contracts are priced at market. The traditional electric operating companies and certain of the natural gas distribution utilities manage fuel-hedging programs implemented per the guidelines of their respective state PSCs or other applicable state regulatory agencies. Southern Company had no material change in market risk exposure for the year ended December 31, 2018 when compared to the year ended December 31, 2017.The changes in fair value of energy-related derivative contracts are substantially attributable to both the volume and the price of natural gas. For the years ended December 31, the changes in fair value of energy-related derivative contracts, the majority of which are composed of regulatory hedges, were as follows: 2018 2017 (in millions)Contracts outstanding at the beginning of the period, assets (liabilities), net$(163) $41Contracts realized or settled93 (8)Current period changes(a)(131) (196)Contracts outstanding at the end of the period, assets (liabilities), net(b)(c)$(201) $(163)(a)Current period changes also include the changes in fair value of new contracts entered into during the period, if any.(b)Excludes premium and intrinsic value associated with weather derivatives of $8 million and $11 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.(c) Includes $6 million of net liabilities related to Gulf Power. See Note 15 to the financial statements under ""Southern Company's Sale of Gulf Power"" for information regarding the sale of Gulf Power on January 1, 2019.The net hedge volumes of energy-related derivative contracts were 431 million mmBtu and 621 million mmBtu at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.For the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power, the weighted average swap contract cost above market prices was approximately $0.12 per mmBtu at December 31, 2018 and $0.15 per mmBtu at December 31, 2017. The majority of the natural gas hedge gains and losses are recovered through the traditional electric operating companies' fuel cost recovery clauses.At December 31, 2018 and 2017, a portion of the Southern Company system's energy-related derivative contracts were designated as regulatory hedges and were related to the applicable company's fuel-hedging program. Therefore, gains and losses are initially recorded as regulatory liabilities and assets, respectively, and then are included in fuel expense as they are recovered through the energy cost recovery clause. Certain other gains and losses on energy-related derivatives, designated as cash flow hedges, are initially deferred in OCI before being recognized in income in the same period as the hedged transaction. Gains and losses on energy-related derivative contracts that are not designated or fail to qualify as hedges are recognized in the statements of income as incurred. See Note 14 to the financial statements for additional information.The Southern Company system uses exchange-traded market-observable contracts, which are categorized as Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy, and over-the-counter contracts that are not exchange traded but are fair valued using prices which are market II-65 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual Reportobservable, and thus fall into Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. See Note 13 to the financial statements for further discussion of fair value measurements. The maturities of the energy-related derivative contracts at December 31, 2018 were as follows: Fair Value Measurements December 31, 2018 TotalFair Value Maturity Year 1 Years 2&3 Years 4&5 (in millions)Level 1$(179) $(59) $(86) $(34)Level 2(22) 20 (17) (25)Level 3— — — —Fair value of contracts outstanding at end of period$(201) $(39) $(103) $(59)The Southern Company system is exposed to market price risk in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to energy-related and interest rate derivative contracts. The Southern Company system only enters into agreements and material transactions with counterparties that have investment grade credit ratings by Moody's and S&P, or with counterparties who have posted collateral to cover potential credit exposure. Therefore, the Southern Company system does not anticipate market risk exposure from nonperformance by the counterparties. For additional information, see Note 1 to the financial statements under ""Financial Instruments"" and Note 14 to the financial statements.With the exception of Southern Company Gas' subsidiary, Atlanta Gas Light, and the Southern Company Gas wholesale gas services business, the Southern Company system is not exposed to concentrations of credit risk. Concentration of credit risk occurs at Atlanta Gas Light for amounts billed for services and other costs to its customers, which consist of 15 Marketers in Georgia responsible for the retail sale of natural gas to end-use customers in Georgia. For 2018, the four largest Marketers based on customer count, which includes SouthStar, accounted for 20% of Southern Company Gas' adjusted operating margin. Southern Company Gas' wholesale gas services business has a concentration of credit risk for services it provides to its counterparties as measured by its 30-day receivable exposure plus forward exposure. At December 31, 2018, Southern Company Gas' wholesale gas services business' top 20 counterparties represented approximately 48%, or $298 million, of its total counterparty exposure and had a weighted average S&P equivalent credit rating of A-, all of which is consistent with the prior year.Southern Company performs periodic reviews of its leveraged lease transactions, both domestic and international, and the creditworthiness of the lessees, including a review of the value of the underlying leased assets and the credit ratings of the lessees. Southern Company's domestic lease transactions generally do not have any credit enhancement mechanisms; however, the lessees in its international lease transactions have pledged various deposits as additional security to secure the obligations. The lessees in Southern Company's international lease transactions are also required to provide additional collateral in the event of a credit downgrade below a certain level.Capital Requirements and Contractual ObligationsThe Southern Company system's construction program is currently estimated to total approximately $8.0 billion for 2019, $7.7 billion for 2020, $6.7 billion for 2021, $6.3 billion for 2022, and $6.0 billion for 2023. These amounts include expenditures of approximately $1.5 billion, $1.2 billion, $1.0 billion, and $0.5 billion for the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 in 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022, respectively. These amounts do not include up to approximately $0.5 billion per year on average for 2019 through 2023 for Southern Power's planned expenditures for plant acquisitions and placeholder growth. These amounts also include capital expenditures related to contractual purchase commitments for nuclear fuel and capital expenditures covered under LTSAs. Estimated capital expenditures to comply with environmental laws and regulations included in these amounts are $0.5 billion, $0.2 billion, $0.3 billion, $0.3 billion, and $0.2 billion for 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023, respectively. These estimated expenditures do not include any potential compliance costs associated with pending regulation of CO2 emissions from fossil fuel-fired electric generating units. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – ""Environmental Matters – Environmental Laws and Regulations"" and "" – Global Climate Issues"" herein for additional information.The traditional electric operating companies also anticipate costs associated with closure and monitoring of ash ponds in accordance with the CCR Rule, which are reflected in Southern Company's ARO liabilities. These costs, which are expected to change and could change materially as underlying assumptions are refined and the cost and the method and timing of compliance activities continue to be evaluated, are currently estimated to be approximately $0.5 billion, $0.5 billion, $0.7 billion, $0.9 billion, and $0.9 billion for 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023, respectively. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – ""Environmental II-66 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual ReportMatters – Environmental Laws and Regulations – Coal Combustion Residuals"" herein and Note 6 to the financial statements for additional information.The construction programs are subject to periodic review and revision, and actual construction costs may vary from these estimates because of numerous factors. These factors include: changes in business conditions; changes in load projections; changes in environmental laws and regulations; the outcome of any legal challenges to environmental rules; changes in electric generating plants, including unit retirements and replacements and adding or changing fuel sources at existing electric generating units, to meet regulatory requirements; changes in FERC rules and regulations; state regulatory agency approvals; changes in the expected environmental compliance program; changes in legislation; the cost and efficiency of construction labor, equipment, and materials; project scope and design changes; storm impacts; and the cost of capital. In addition, there can be no assurance that costs related to capital expenditures will be fully recovered. Additionally, planned expenditures for plant acquisitions may vary due to market opportunities and Southern Power's ability to execute its growth strategy. See Note 15 to the financial statements under ""Southern Power"" for additional information regarding Southern Power's plant acquisitions.The construction program also includes Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, which includes components based on new technology that only recently began initial operation in the global nuclear industry at this scale and which may be subject to additional revised cost estimates during construction. The ability to control costs and avoid cost and schedule overruns during the development, construction, and operation of new facilities is subject to a number of factors, including, but not limited to, changes in labor costs, availability, and productivity; challenges with management of contractors, subcontractors, or vendors; adverse weather conditions; shortages, increased costs, or inconsistent quality of equipment, materials, and labor; contractor or supplier delay; non-performance under construction, operating, or other agreements; operational readiness, including specialized operator training and required site safety programs; engineering or design problems; design and other licensing-based compliance matters, including the timely resolution of ITAAC and the related approvals by the NRC; challenges with start-up activities, including major equipment failure and system integration; and/or operational performance. See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Georgia Power – Nuclear Construction"" for information regarding Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 and additional factors that may impact construction expenditures.As a result of NRC requirements, Alabama Power and Georgia Power have external trust funds for nuclear decommissioning costs; however, Alabama Power currently has no additional funding requirements. For additional information, see Note 6 to the financial statements under ""Nuclear Decommissioning.""In addition, as discussed in Note 11 to the financial statements, the Southern Company system provides postretirement benefits to the majority of its employees and funds trusts to the extent required by PSCs, other applicable state regulatory agencies, or the FERC.Funding requirements related to obligations associated with scheduled maturities of long-term debt, as well as the related interest, derivative obligations, preferred stock dividends of subsidiaries, leases, pipeline charges, storage capacity, gas supply, asset management agreements, other purchase commitments, ARO settlements, and trusts are detailed in the contractual obligations table that follows.

These factors include the ability to maintain a constructive regulatory environment, to maintain and grow energy sales and customers, and to effectively manage and secure timely recovery of costs. These costs include those related to projected long-term demand growth, stringent environmental standards, including CCR rules, reliability, fuel, capital expenditures, including improving the electric transmission and distribution systems, and restoration following major storms. Alabama Power has various regulatory mechanisms that operate to address cost recovery. Effectively operating pursuant to these regulatory mechanisms and appropriately balancing required costs and capital expenditures with customer prices will continue to challenge Alabama Power for the foreseeable future. On May 1, 2018, the Alabama PSC approved modifications to Rate RSE and other commitments designed to position Alabama Power to address the retail rate impact and the growing pressure on its credit quality resulting from the Tax Reform Legislation. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – ""Retail Regulatory Matters"" and FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY – ""Credit Rating Risk"" herein for additional information.Alabama Power continues to focus on several key performance indicators including, but not limited to, customer satisfaction, plant availability, system reliability, and net income after dividends on preferred stock. Alabama Power's financial success is directly tied to customer satisfaction. Key elements of ensuring customer satisfaction include outstanding service, high reliability, and competitive prices. Management uses customer satisfaction surveys to evaluate Alabama Power's results and generally targets the top quartile of these surveys in measuring performance.See RESULTS OF OPERATIONS herein for information on Alabama Power's financial performance.EarningsAlabama Power's 2018 net income after dividends on preferred and preference stock was $930 million, representing an $82 million, or 9.7%, increase over the previous year. The increase was primarily due to a decrease in income tax expense, partially offset by a decrease in retail revenues associated with customer bill credits related to the Tax Reform Legislation. The increase also reflects an increase in revenues associated with colder weather in the first quarter 2018 and warmer weather in the second and third quarters 2018 compared to the corresponding periods in 2017, partially offset by an accrual for a Rate RSE refund. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – ""Retail Regulatory Matters – Rate RSE"" herein for additional information.Alabama Power's 2017 net income after dividends on preferred and preference stock was $848 million, representing a $26 million, or 3.2%, increase over the previous year. The increase was primarily due to an increase in rates under Rate RSE effective in January 2017 and the impact of a Rate RSE refund recorded in 2016. These increases to income were partially offset by a decrease in retail revenues associated with milder weather, lower customer usage, and an increase in non-fuel operations and maintenance expenses in 2017 as compared to 2016. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – ""Retail Regulatory Matters – Rate RSE"" herein for additional information.II-70 Table of Contents Index to Financial StatementsMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Alabama Power Company 2018 Annual ReportRESULTS OF OPERATIONSA condensed income statement for Alabama Power follows: Amount Increase (Decrease)from Prior Year 2018 2018 2017 (in millions)Operating revenues$6,032 $(7) $150Fuel1,301 76 (72)Purchased power432 104 (6)Other operations and maintenance1,669 (40) 152Depreciation and amortization764 28 33Taxes other than income taxes389 5 4Total operating expenses4,555 173 111Operating income1,477 (180) 39Allowance for equity funds used during construction62 23 11Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized323 18 3Other income (expense), net20 (23) 17Income taxes291 (277) 37Net income945 79 27Dividends on preferred and preference stock15 (3) 1Net income after dividends on preferred and preference stock$930 $82 $26Operating RevenuesOperating revenues for 2018 were $6.0 billion, reflecting a $7 million decrease from 2017.

These revenues decreased $91 million, or 1.7%, in 2018 as compared to the prior year. The decrease in 2018 was primarily due to customer bill credits related to the Tax Reform Legislation and an accrual for a Rate RSE refund, partially offset by an increase in fuel revenues and colder weather in the first quarter and warmer weather in the second and third quarters 2018 as compared to the corresponding periods in 2017. II-71 Table of Contents Index to Financial StatementsMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Alabama Power Company 2018 Annual ReportRetail revenues in 2017 were $5.5 billion. These revenues increased $136 million, or 2.6%, in 2017 as compared to the prior year. The increase in 2017 was primarily due to an increase in rates under Rate RSE effective in January 2017, partially offset by a decrease in fuel revenues and milder weather in the first and third quarters 2017 as compared to the corresponding periods in 2016.See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Alabama Power – Rate RSE"" for additional information. See ""Energy Sales"" herein for a discussion of changes in the volume of energy sold, including changes related to sales decline and weather. Electric rates include provisions to recognize the recovery of fuel costs, purchased power costs, PPAs certificated by the Alabama PSC, and costs associated with the natural disaster reserve. Under these provisions, fuel and other cost recovery revenues generally equal fuel and other cost recovery expenses and do not affect net income. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – ""Retail Regulatory Matters – Rate ECR"" herein for additional information.Wholesale revenues from power sales to non-affiliated utilities were as follows: 2018 2017 2016 (in millions)Capacity and other$101 $96 $93Energy178 180 190Total non-affiliated$279 $276 $283Wholesale revenues from sales to non-affiliates will vary depending on fuel prices, the market prices of wholesale energy compared to the cost of Alabama Power's and the Southern Company system's generation, demand for energy within the Southern Company system's electric service territory, and availability of the Southern Company system's generation. Increases and decreases in energy revenues that are driven by fuel prices are accompanied by an increase or decrease in fuel costs and do not affect net income. Short-term opportunity energy sales are also included in wholesale energy sales to non-affiliates. These opportunity sales are made at market-based rates that generally provide a margin above Alabama Power's variable cost to produce the energy.In 2018, wholesale revenues from sales to non-affiliates increased $3 million, or 1.1%, as compared to the prior year. In 2017, wholesale revenues from sales to non-affiliates decreased $7 million, or 2.5%, as compared to the prior year.Wholesale revenues from sales to affiliated companies will vary depending on demand and the availability and cost of generating resources at each company. These affiliate sales and purchases are made in accordance with the IIC, as approved by the FERC. These transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings since this energy is generally sold at marginal cost and energy purchases are generally offset by energy revenues through Alabama Power's energy cost recovery clause.In 2018, wholesale revenues from sales to affiliates increased $22 million, or 22.7%, as compared to the prior year. In 2018, the price of energy increased 12.3% as a result of higher natural gas prices and KWH sales increased 10.0% primarily due to an increase in hydro generation. In 2017, wholesale revenues from sales to affiliates increased $28 million, or 40.6%, as compared to the prior year. In 2017, KWH sales increased 31.1% as a result of supporting Southern Company system transmission reliability and a 6.9% increase in the price of energy primarily due to higher natural gas prices.In 2018, other operating revenues increased $59 million, or 28.4%, as compared to the prior year primarily due to revenues related to unregulated sales of products and services that were reclassified as other revenues as a result of the adoption of ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC 606). In prior periods, these revenues were included in other income (expense), net. See Note 1 to the financial statements for additional information regarding Alabama Power's adoption of ASC 606. This increase was partially offset by decreases in open access transmission tariff revenues primarily due to a lower rate related to the Tax Reform Legislation.II-72 Table of Contents Index to Financial StatementsMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Alabama Power Company 2018 Annual ReportEnergy SalesChanges in revenues are influenced heavily by the change in the volume of energy sold from year to year.

Retail energy sales in 2018 were 3.7% higher than in 2017. Residential sales and commercial sales increased 8.2% and 1.9% in 2018, respectively, primarily due to colder weather in the first quarter and warmer weather in the second and third quarters 2018 as compared to the corresponding periods in 2017. Weather-adjusted residential sales were 0.4% lower in 2018 primarily due to lower customer usage resulting from an increase in penetration of energy-efficient residential appliances. Weather-adjusted commercial sales were 1.0% lower in 2018 primarily due to lower customer usage resulting from customer initiatives in energy savings and an ongoing migration to the electronic commerce business model. Industrial sales increased 1.4% in 2018 as compared to 2017 as a result of an increase in demand resulting from changes in production levels primarily in the primary metals, pipelines, and mining sectors offset by the paper sector.Retail energy sales in 2017 were 2.3% lower than in 2016. Residential sales and commercial sales decreased 6.1% and 3.4% in 2017, respectively, primarily due to milder weather in the first and third quarters 2017 as compared to the corresponding periods in 2016. Weather-adjusted residential sales were 1.2% lower in 2017 primarily due to lower customer usage resulting from an increase in penetration of energy-efficient residential appliances, partially offset by customer growth. Weather-adjusted commercial sales were 1.3% lower in 2017 primarily due to lower customer usage resulting from customer initiatives in energy savings and an ongoing migration to the electronic commerce business model, partially offset by customer growth. Industrial sales increased 1.7% in 2017 as compared to 2016 as a result of an increase in demand resulting from changes in production levels primarily in the primary metals, chemicals, and mining sectors offset by the pipelines and paper sectors.See ""Operating Revenues"" above for a discussion of significant changes in wholesale revenues from sales to non-affiliates and wholesale revenues from sales to affiliated companies related to changes in price and KWH sales.Fuel and Purchased Power ExpensesThe mix of fuel sources for generation of electricity is determined primarily by the unit cost of fuel consumed, demand, and the availability of generating units. Additionally, Alabama Power purchases a portion of its electricity needs from the wholesale market.II-73 Table of Contents Index to Financial StatementsMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Alabama Power Company 2018 Annual ReportDetails of Alabama Power's generation and purchased power were as follows: 2018 2017 2016Total generation (in billions of KWHs)60.5 60.3 60.2Total purchased power (in billions of KWHs)8.1 6.4 7.1Sources of generation (percent) — Coal50 50 53Nuclear23 24 23Gas19 20 19Hydro8 6 5Cost of fuel, generated (in cents per net KWH) — Coal2.73 2.60 2.75Nuclear0.77 0.75 0.78Gas2.84 2.72 2.67Average cost of fuel, generated (in cents per net KWH)(a)(b)2.26 2.14 2.26Average cost of purchased power (in cents per net KWH)(c)5.47 5.29 4.80(a)For 2018, cost of fuel, generated and average cost of fuel, generated excludes a $30 million adjustment associated with a May 2018 Alabama PSC accounting order related to excess deferred income taxes. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – ""Retail Regulatory Matters – Tax Reform Accounting Order"" herein for additional information.(b)KWHs generated by hydro are excluded from the average cost of fuel, generated.(c)Average cost of purchased power includes fuel, energy, and transmission purchased by Alabama Power for tolling agreements where power is generated by the provider.Fuel and purchased power expenses were $1.73 billion in 2018, an increase of $180 million, or 11.6%, compared to 2017. The increase was primarily due to an $81 million net increase related to the volume of KWHs purchased and generated, a $54 million increase in the average cost of fuel, and a $15 million increase in the average cost of purchased power. In addition, fuel expense increased $30 million in 2018 as a result of an Alabama PSC accounting order authorizing the amortization of a regulatory liability to offset under recovered fuel costs. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – ""Retail Regulatory Matters – Tax Reform Accounting Order"" herein for additional information.Fuel and purchased power expenses were $1.55 billion in 2017, a decrease of $78 million, or 4.8%, compared to 2016. The decrease was primarily due to a $67 million net decrease related to the volume of KWHs generated and purchased and a $42 million decrease in the average cost of fuel, partially offset by a $31 million increase in the average cost of purchased power.Fuel and purchased power energy transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings, since energy expenses are generally offset by energy revenues through Alabama Power's energy cost recovery clause. Alabama Power, along with the Alabama PSC, continuously monitors the under/over recovered balance to determine whether adjustments to billing rates are required. See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Alabama Power – Rate ECR"" for additional information.FuelFuel expenses were $1.3 billion in 2018, an increase of $76 million, or 6.2%, compared to 2017. The increase was primarily due to a 5.0% increase in the average cost of KWHs generated by coal and a 4.4% increase in the average cost of KWHs generated by natural gas, which excludes tolling agreements. These increases were partially offset by a 28.3% increase in the volume of KWHs generated by hydro and a 2.1% decrease in the volume of KWHs generated by natural gas. Fuel expenses were $1.2 billion in 2017, a decrease of $72 million, or 5.6%, compared to 2016. The decrease was primarily due to a 12.2% increase in the volume of KWHs generated by hydro, a 5.8% decrease in the volume of KWHs generated by coal, and a 5.5% and 3.9% decrease in the average cost of KWHs generated by coal and nuclear fuel, respectively. These decreases were partially offset by an 8.1% increase in the volume of KWHs generated by nuclear fuel and a 4.0% increase in the volume of KWHs generated by natural gas. In addition, fuel expense increased $30 million in 2018 as a result of an Alabama PSC accounting order authorizing the amortization of a regulatory liability to offset under recovered fuel costs. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – ""Retail Regulatory Matters – Tax Reform Accounting Order"" herein for additional information.II-74 Table of Contents Index to Financial StatementsMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Alabama Power Company 2018 Annual ReportPurchased Power – Non-AffiliatesPurchased power expense from non-affiliates was $216 million in 2018, an increase of $46 million, or 27.1%, compared to 2017. This increase was primarily due to an 18.9% increase in the amount of energy purchased due to colder weather in the first quarter and warmer weather in the second and third quarters 2018 as compared to the corresponding periods in 2017 and a 6.6% increase in the average cost per KWH purchased due to higher natural gas prices. Purchased power expense from non-affiliates was $170 million in 2017, an increase of $4 million, or 2.4%, compared to 2016. Energy purchases from non-affiliates will vary depending on the market prices of wholesale energy as compared to the cost of the Southern Company system's generation, demand for energy within the Southern Company system's service territory, and the availability of the Southern Company system's generation.Purchased Power – AffiliatesPurchased power expense from affiliates was $216 million in 2018, an increase of $58 million, or 36.7%, compared to 2017. This increase was primarily due to a 34.5% increase in the amount of energy purchased due to colder weather in the first quarter and warmer weather in the second and third quarters 2018 as compared to the corresponding periods in 2017 and a 1.4% increase in the average cost per KWH purchased due to higher natural gas prices. Purchased power expense from affiliates was $158 million in 2017, a decrease of $10 million, or 6.0%, compared to 2016. This decrease was primarily due to a 17.2% decrease in the amount of energy purchased due to milder weather partially offset by a 13.9% increase in the average cost per KWH purchased due to higher natural gas prices. Energy purchases from affiliates will vary depending on demand for energy and the availability and cost of generating resources at each company within the Southern Company system. These purchases are made in accordance with the IIC or other contractual agreements, as approved by the FERC.Other Operations and Maintenance ExpensesIn 2018, other operations and maintenance expenses decreased $40 million, or 2.3%, as compared to the prior year. Generation costs decreased $34 million primarily due to fewer outages resulting in lower costs. Employee benefit costs, including pension costs, decreased $26 million primarily due to lower active medical costs. Customer service costs decreased $10 million primarily due to cost-saving initiatives. These decreases were partially offset by a $47 million increase in expenses from unregulated sales of products and services that were reclassified as other operations and maintenance expenses as a result of the adoption of ASC 606. In prior periods, these expenses were included in other income (expense), net. See Note 1 to the financial statements under ""Revenue"" for additional information. In 2017, other operations and maintenance expenses increased $152 million, or 9.8%, as compared to the prior year. Distribution and transmission expenses increased $58 million primarily due to vegetation management expenses. Generation costs increased $38 million primarily due to outage costs. Employee benefit costs, including pension costs, increased $32 million. See Note 11 to the financial statements under ""Pension Plans"" for additional information.Depreciation and AmortizationDepreciation and amortization increased $28 million, or 3.8%, in 2018 as compared to the prior year primarily due to additional plant in service related to distribution, transmission, compliance-related steam, and other generation production projects. Depreciation and amortization increased $33 million, or 4.7%, in 2017 as compared to the prior year primarily due to additional plant in service and an increase in generation-related depreciation rates, effective January 1, 2017, associated with compliance-related steam projects and ARO recovery, partially offset by a decrease in distribution-related depreciation rates. See Note 5 to the financial statements under ""Depreciation and Amortization"" for additional information.Allowance for Equity Funds Used During ConstructionAFUDC equity increased $23 million, or 59.0%, in 2018 as compared to the prior year. The increase was primarily associated with steam and transmission construction projects. AFUDC equity increased $11 million, or 39.3%, in 2017 as compared to the prior year. The increase was primarily associated with steam, transmission, and nuclear construction projects. See Note 1 to financial statements under ""Allowance for Funds Used During Construction"" for additional information.Interest Expense, Net of Amounts CapitalizedInterest expense, net of amounts capitalized increased $18 million, or 5.9%, in 2018 as compared to the prior year primarily due to an increase in debt outstanding and higher interest rates, partially offset by an increase in the amounts capitalized. Interest II-75 Table of Contents Index to Financial StatementsMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Alabama Power Company 2018 Annual Reportexpense, net of amounts capitalized increased $3 million, or 1.0%, in 2017 as compared to the prior year. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – ""Financing Activities"" herein for additional information.Other Income (Expense), NetOther income (expense), net decreased $23 million, or 53.5%, in 2018 as compared to the prior year primarily due to an increase in charitable donations and the reclassification of revenues and expenses associated with unregulated sales of products and services to other revenues and operations and maintenance expenses, respectively, as a result of the adoption of ASC 606. See Note 1 to the financial statements under ""Revenue"" for additional information. Other income (expense), net increased $17 million, or 65.4%, in 2017 as compared to the prior year primarily due to increases in unregulated lighting services and a decrease in the non-service cost components of net periodic pension and other postretirement benefits costs. See Note 1 to the financial statements under ""Recently Adopted Accounting Standards"" and Note 11 to the financial statements for additional information on net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit costs.Income Taxes Income taxes decreased $277 million, or 48.8%, in 2018 as compared to the prior year primarily due to the reduction in the federal income tax rate, the benefit from the flowback of excess deferred income taxes as a result of the Tax Reform Legislation, and lower pre-tax earnings. Income taxes increased $37 million, or 7.0%, in 2017 as compared to the prior year primarily due to higher pre-tax earnings, an increase related to prior year tax return actualization, and an increase in income tax reserves, partially offset by an increase in state income tax credits. The impact to net income as a result of the Tax Reform Legislation was not material due to the application of regulatory accounting. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – ""Income Tax Matters – Federal Tax Reform Legislation"" herein and Note 10 to the financial statements for additional information.Effects of InflationAlabama Power is subject to rate regulation that is generally based on the recovery of historical and projected costs. The effects of inflation can create an economic loss since the recovery of costs could be in dollars that have less purchasing power. Any adverse effect of inflation on Alabama Power's results of operations has not been substantial in recent years. See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Alabama Power – Rate RSE"" for additional information.FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIALGeneralAlabama Power operates as a vertically integrated utility providing electric service to retail and wholesale customers within its traditional service territory located in the State of Alabama and to wholesale customers in the Southeast. Prices for electric service provided by Alabama Power to retail customers are set by the Alabama PSC under cost-based regulatory principles. Retail rates and earnings are reviewed and may be adjusted periodically within certain limitations. Prices for wholesale electric service, interconnecting transmission lines, and the exchange of electric power are regulated by the FERC. See ACCOUNTING POLICIES – ""Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – Utility Regulation"" herein and Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Alabama Power"" for additional information about regulatory matters.The results of operations for the past three years are not necessarily indicative of future earnings potential. The level of Alabama Power's future earnings depends on numerous factors that affect the opportunities, challenges, and risks of Alabama Power's primary business of providing electric service. These factors include Alabama Power's ability to maintain a constructive regulatory environment that continues to allow for the timely recovery of prudently-incurred costs during a time of increasing costs and the weak pace of growth in new customers and electricity use per customer, especially in residential and commercial markets. Earnings will also depend upon maintaining and growing sales, considering, among other things, the adoption and/or penetration rates of increasingly energy-efficient technologies and increasing volumes of electronic commerce transactions, both of which could contribute to a net reduction in customer usage. Earnings are subject to a variety of other factors. These factors include weather, competition, new energy contracts with other utilities, energy conservation practiced by customers, the use of alternative energy sources by customers, the price of electricity, the price elasticity of demand, and the rate of economic growth or decline in Alabama Power's service territory. Demand for electricity is primarily driven by the pace of economic growth that may be affected by changes in regional and global economic conditions, which may impact future earnings.II-76 Table of Contents Index to Financial StatementsMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Alabama Power Company 2018 Annual ReportEnvironmental MattersAlabama Power's operations are regulated by state and federal environmental agencies through a variety of laws and regulations governing air, water, land, and protection of other natural resources. Alabama Power maintains comprehensive environmental compliance and GHG strategies to assess upcoming requirements and compliance costs associated with these environmental laws and regulations. The costs, including capital expenditures, operations and maintenance costs, and costs reflected in ARO liabilities, required to comply with environmental laws and regulations and to achieve stated goals may impact future electric generating unit retirement and replacement decisions, results of operations, cash flows, and/or financial condition. Related costs may result from the installation of additional environmental controls, closure and monitoring of CCR facilities, unit retirements, or changing fuel sources for certain existing units, as well as related upgrades to Alabama Power's transmission and distribution systems. A major portion of these costs is expected to be recovered through existing ratemaking provisions. The ultimate impact of environmental laws and regulations and the GHG goals discussed herein will depend on various factors, such as state adoption and implementation of requirements, the availability and cost of any deployed technology, fuel prices, and the outcome of pending and/or future legal challenges.New or revised environmental laws and regulations could affect many areas of Alabama Power's operations. The impact of any such changes cannot be determined at this time. Environmental compliance costs could affect earnings if such costs cannot continue to be recovered in rates on a timely basis. Environmental compliance costs are recovered through Rate CNP Compliance. See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Alabama Power – Rate CNP Compliance"" for additional information. Further, increased costs that are recovered through regulated rates could contribute to reduced demand for electricity, which could negatively affect results of operations, cash flows, and/or financial condition. Additionally, many commercial and industrial customers may also be affected by existing and future environmental requirements, which for some may have the potential to ultimately affect their demand for electricity.Through 2018, Alabama Power has invested approximately $5.4 billion in environmental capital retrofit projects to comply with environmental requirements, with annual totals of approximately $681 million, $491 million, and $260 million for 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. Although the timing, requirements, and estimated costs could change as environmental laws and regulations are adopted or modified, as compliance plans are revised or updated, and as legal challenges to rules are initiated or completed, Alabama Power's current compliance strategy estimates capital expenditures of $635 million from 2019 through 2023, with annual totals of approximately $226 million in 2019, $68 million in 2020, $118 million in 2021, $112 million in 2022, and $111 million in 2023. These estimates do not include any potential compliance costs associated with pending regulation of CO2 emissions from fossil fuel-fired electric generating units. See ""Global Climate Issues"" herein for additional information. Alabama Power also anticipates substantial expenditures associated with ash pond closure and ground water monitoring under the CCR Rule, which are reflected in Alabama Power's ARO liabilities. See FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY – ""Capital Requirements and Contractual Obligations"" herein and Note 6 to the financial statements for additional information.Environmental Laws and RegulationsAir QualityThe EPA has set National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for six air pollutants (carbon monoxide, lead, nitrogen dioxide, ozone, particulate matter, and SO2) to protect and improve the nation's air quality, which it reviews and revises periodically. Following a NAAQS revision, states are required to develop an EPA-approved plan to protect air quality. These state plans can require additional emission controls, improvements in control efficiency, or fuel changes which can result in increased compliance and operational costs. NAAQS requirements can also adversely affect the siting of new electric generating facilities. No areas within Alabama Power's service territory are currently designated nonattainment for any NAAQS. If areas are designated as nonattainment in the future, increased compliance costs could result.In 2011, the EPA finalized the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR) to address impacts of SO2 and NOX emissions from fossil fuel-fired electric generating plants. CSAPR establishes emissions trading programs and budgets for certain states and allocates emissions allowances for sources in those states. In 2016, the EPA published a final rule establishing more stringent ozone season NOX emissions budgets in Alabama. Increases in either future fossil fuel-fired generation or the availability or cost of CSAPR allowances could have a negative financial impact on results of operations for Alabama Power.The EPA finalized regional haze regulations in 2005 and 2017. These regulations require states, tribal governments, and various federal agencies to develop and implement plans to reduce pollutants that impair visibility and demonstrate reasonable progress toward the goal of restoring natural visibility conditions in certain areas, including national parks and wilderness areas. States must submit a revised state implementation plan (SIP) to the EPA demonstrating continued reasonable progress towards achieving visibility improvement goals. The EPA approved the regional progress SIP for the State of Alabama.II-77 Table of Contents Index to Financial StatementsMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Alabama Power Company 2018 Annual ReportWater QualityIn 2014, the EPA finalized requirements under Section 316(b) of the Clean Water Act (CWA) to regulate cooling water intake structures (CWIS) to minimize their effects on fish and other aquatic life at existing power plants (e.g. coal, natural gas, oil, and nuclear generating plants) and manufacturing facilities. The regulation requires plant-specific studies to determine applicable CWIS changes to protect organisms that either get caught on the intake screens (impingement) or are drawn into the cooling system (entrainment). Alabama Power is conducting these studies and currently anticipates applicable CWIS changes may include fish-friendly CWIS screens with fish return systems and minor additions of monitoring equipment at certain plants. However, the ultimate impact of this rule will depend on the outcome of these plant-specific studies, any additional protective measures required to be incorporated into each plant's National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit based on site-specific factors, and the outcome of any legal challenges.In 2015, the EPA finalized the steam electric effluent limitations guidelines (ELG) rule (2015 ELG Rule) that set national standards for wastewater discharges from new and existing steam electric generating units generating greater than 50 MWs. The 2015 ELG Rule prohibits effluent discharges of certain waste streams and imposes stringent limits on flue gas desulfurization (scrubber) wastewater discharges. The revised technology-based limits and the CCR Rule require extensive changes to existing ash and wastewater management systems or the installation and operation of new ash and wastewater management systems. Compliance with the 2015 ELG Rule is expected to require capital expenditures and increased operational costs primarily for Alabama Power's coal-fired electric generation. State environmental agencies will incorporate specific compliance applicability dates in the NPDES permitting process for each ELG waste stream no later than December 31, 2023. The EPA is scheduled to issue a new rulemaking by December 2019 that could revise the limitations and applicability dates of two of the waste streams regulated in the 2015 ELG Rule. The impact of any changes to the 2015 ELG Rule will depend on the content of the new rule and the outcome of any legal challenges. Alabama Power does not anticipate that the unavailability of any units as a result of the ELG rule will have a material impact on Alabama Power's operations or financial condition.In 2015, the EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) jointly published a final rule that revised the regulatory definition of waters of the United States (WOTUS) for all CWA programs. The rule significantly expanded the scope of federal jurisdiction over waterbodies (such as rivers, streams, canals, and wastewater treatment ponds), which could impact new generation projects and permitting and reporting requirements associated with the installation, expansion, and maintenance of transmission and distribution projects. The EPA and the Corps are expected to publish a final rule in 2019 to replace the 2015 WOTUS definition. The impact of any changes to the 2015 WOTUS rule will depend on the content of this final rule and the outcome of any legal challenges.Coal Combustion ResidualsIn 2015, the EPA finalized non-hazardous solid waste regulations for the disposal of CCR, including coal ash and gypsum, in landfills and surface impoundments (ash ponds) at active generating power plants. In addition to the EPA's CCR Rule, the State of Alabama has also finalized regulations regarding the handling of CCR that have been provided to the EPA for review. This state CCR rule is generally consistent with the federal CCR Rule. The EPA's CCR Rule requires landfills and ash ponds to be evaluated against a set of performance criteria and potentially closed if minimum criteria are not met. Closure of existing landfills and ash ponds could require installation of equipment and infrastructure to manage CCR in accordance with the CCR Rule. Based on cost estimates for closure in place and monitoring of ash ponds pursuant to the CCR Rule, Alabama Power recorded AROs for each CCR unit in 2015. As further analysis was performed and closure details were developed, Alabama Power has continued to periodically update these cost estimates, as discussed further below.The EPA published certain amendments to the CCR Rule, which became effective August 29, 2018. These amendments extend the date from April 2019 to October 31, 2020 to cease sending CCR and other waste streams to ash ponds that demonstrate compliance with all except two of the specified performance criteria.On August 21, 2018, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit issued a decision suggesting the EPA should regulate previously-excluded inactive ash ponds located at retired generation facilities and questioning both the ability of unlined ash ponds to continue operating no matter the performance criteria results and the classification of clay-lined landfills and ash ponds. These developments could impact the expected timing of Alabama Power's landfill and ash pond closure activities, but the extent of any impact will depend on the outcome of ongoing litigation, anticipated EPA rulemaking action to establish further guidance, and the outcome of any legal challenges.In June 2018, Alabama Power recorded an increase of approximately $1.2 billion to its AROs related to the CCR Rule. The revised cost estimates were based on information from feasibility studies performed on ash ponds in use at plants operated by Alabama Power. During the second quarter 2018, Alabama Power's management completed its analysis of these studies which indicated that additional closure costs, primarily related to increases in estimated ash volume, water management requirements, II-78 Table of Contents Index to Financial StatementsMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Alabama Power Company 2018 Annual Reportand design revisions, will be required to close these ash ponds under the planned closure-in-place methodology. As the level of work becomes more defined in the next 12 months, it is likely that these cost estimates will change and the change could be material.Alabama Power expects to periodically update its ARO cost estimates. Absent continued recovery of ARO costs through regulated rates, Alabama Power's results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition could be materially impacted. See FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY – ""Capital Requirements and Contractual Obligations"" herein and Note 6 to the financial statements for additional information.The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time. Nuclear DecommissioningIn June 2018, Alabama Power completed an updated decommissioning cost site study for Plant Farley. The estimated cost of decommissioning based on the study resulted in an increase in Alabama Power's ARO liability of approximately $300 million. Amounts previously contributed to Alabama Power's external trust funds are currently projected to be adequate to meet the updated decommissioning obligations. See Note 6 to the financial statements for additional information.Global Climate IssuesOn August 31, 2018, the EPA published a proposed rule known as the Affordable Clean Energy (ACE) Rule, which is intended to replace a regulation enacted in 2015 known as the Clean Power Plan (CPP), that would limit CO2 emissions from existing fossil fuel-fired electric generating units. The CPP has been stayed by the U.S. Supreme Court since 2016. The ACE Rule would require states to develop GHG unit-specific emission rate standards based on heat-rate efficiency improvements for existing fossil fuel-fired steam units. As proposed, combustion turbines, including natural gas combined cycles, are not affected sources. As of January 1, 2019, Alabama Power has ownership interests in 20 fossil fuel-fired steam units to which the proposed ACE Rule is applicable. The ultimate impact of this rule to Alabama Power is currently unknown and will depend on changes between the proposal and the final rule, subsequent state plan developments and requirements, and any associated legal challenges.On December 20, 2018, the EPA published a proposed review of the Standards of Performance for Greenhouse Gas Emissions from New, Modified, and Reconstructed Stationary Sources: Electric Utility Generating Units final rule (2015 NSPS rule). The EPA's final 2015 NSPS rule set standards of performance for new, modified, and reconstructed electric utility generating units which included stationary combustion turbines and fossil-fired steam boilers. This proposal reduces the stringency of the 2015 NSPS rule by not basing the new and reconstructed fossil-fired steam boiler and IGCC standards on partial carbon capture and sequestration. The impact of any changes to this rule will depend on the content of the final rule and the outcome of any legal challenges.The EPA's GHG reporting rule requires annual reporting of GHG emissions expressed in terms of metric tons of CO2 equivalent emissions for a company's operational control of facilities. Based on ownership or financial control of facilities, Alabama Power's 2017 GHG emissions were approximately 37 million metric tons of CO2 equivalent. The preliminary estimate of Alabama Power's 2018 GHG emissions on the same basis is approximately 36 million metric tons of CO2 equivalent.Through 2017, the Southern Company system has achieved an estimated GHG emission reduction of 36% since 2007. In April 2018, Southern Company established an intermediate goal of a 50% reduction in carbon emissions from 2007 levels by 2030 and a long-term goal of low- to no-carbon operations by 2050. To achieve these goals, the Southern Company system expects to continue growing its renewable energy portfolio, optimize technology advancements to modernize its transmission and distribution systems, increase the use of natural gas for generation, complete ongoing construction projects, invest in energy efficiency, and continue research and development efforts focused on technologies to lower GHG emissions. The Southern Company system's ability to achieve these goals also will be dependent on many external factors, including supportive national energy policies, low natural gas prices, and the development, deployment, and advancement of relevant energy technologies.FERC MattersOpen Access Transmission TariffOn May 10, 2018, AMEA and Cooperative Energy filed with the FERC a complaint against SCS and the traditional electric operating companies (including Alabama Power) claiming that the current 11.25% base ROE used in calculating the annual transmission revenue requirements of the traditional electric operating companies' (including Alabama Power's) open access transmission tariff is unjust and unreasonable as measured by the applicable FERC standards. The complaint requested that the base ROE be set no higher than 8.65% and that the FERC order refunds for the difference in revenue requirements that results from applying a just and reasonable ROE established in this proceeding upon determining the current ROE is unjust and II-79 Table of Contents Index to Financial StatementsMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Alabama Power Company 2018 Annual Reportunreasonable. On June 18, 2018, SCS and the traditional electric operating companies (including Alabama Power) filed their response challenging the adequacy of the showing presented by the complainants and offering support for the current ROE. On September 6, 2018, the FERC issued an order establishing a refund effective date of May 10, 2018 in the event a refund is due and initiating an investigation and settlement procedures regarding the current base ROE. Through December 31, 2018, the estimated maximum potential refund is not expected to be material to Alabama Power's results of operations or cash flows. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.Retail Regulatory MattersAlabama Power's revenues from regulated retail operations are collected through various rate mechanisms subject to the oversight of the Alabama PSC. Alabama Power currently recovers its costs from the regulated retail business primarily through Rate RSE, Rate CNP, Rate ECR, and Rate NDR. In addition, the Alabama PSC issues accounting orders to address current events impacting Alabama Power. See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Alabama Power"" for additional information regarding Alabama Power's rate mechanisms and accounting orders.Rate RSEThe Alabama PSC has adopted Rate RSE that provides for periodic annual adjustments based upon Alabama Power's projected weighted common equity return (WCER) compared to an allowable range. Rate RSE adjustments are based on forward-looking information for the applicable upcoming calendar year. Rate RSE adjustments for any two-year period, when averaged together, cannot exceed 4.0% and any annual adjustment is limited to 5.0%. When the projected WCER is under the allowed range, there is an adjusting point of 5.98% and eligibility for a performance-based adder of seven basis points, or 0.07%, to the WCER adjusting point if Alabama Power (i) has an ""A"" credit rating equivalent with at least one of the recognized rating agencies or (ii) is in the top one-third of a designated customer value benchmark survey. If Alabama Power's actual retail return is above the allowed WCER range, the excess will be refunded to customers unless otherwise directed by the Alabama PSC; however, there is no provision for additional customer billings should the actual retail return fall below the WCER range. Prior to January 2019, retail rates remained unchanged when the WCER range was between 5.75% and 6.21%. On May 1, 2018, the Alabama PSC approved modifications to Rate RSE and other commitments designed to position Alabama Power to address the growing pressure on its credit quality resulting from the Tax Reform Legislation, without increasing retail rates under Rate RSE in the near term. Alabama Power plans to reduce growth in total debt by increasing equity, with corresponding reductions in debt issuances, thereby de-leveraging its capital structure. Alabama Power's goal is to achieve an equity ratio of approximately 55% by the end of 2025. At December 31, 2018, Alabama Power's equity ratio was approximately 47%.The approved modifications to Rate RSE began for billings in January 2019. The modifications include reducing the top of the allowed WCER range from 6.21% to 6.15% and modifications to the refund mechanism applicable to prior year actual results. The modifications to the refund mechanism allow Alabama Power to retain a portion of the revenue that causes the actual WCER for a given year to exceed the allowed range.Generally, if Alabama Power's actual WCER is between 6.15% and 7.65%, customers will receive 25% of the amount between 6.15% and 6.65%, 40% of the amount between 6.65% and 7.15%, and 75% of the amount between 7.15% and 7.65%. Customers will receive all amounts in excess of an actual WCER of 7.65%. In conjunction with these modifications to Rate RSE, on May 8, 2018, Alabama Power consented to a moratorium on any upward adjustments under Rate RSE for 2019 and 2020 and will also return $50 million to customers through bill credits in 2019.On November 30, 2018, Alabama Power made its required annual Rate RSE submission to the Alabama PSC of projected data for calendar year 2019. Projected earnings were within the specified range; therefore, retail rates under Rate RSE remain unchanged for 2019.At December 31, 2018, Alabama Power's retail return exceeded the allowed WCER range, which resulted in Alabama Power establishing a regulatory liability of $109 million for Rate RSE refunds. In accordance with an Alabama PSC order issued on February 5, 2019, Alabama Power will apply $75 million to reduce the Rate ECR under recovered balance and the remaining $34 million will be refunded to customers through bill credits in July through September 2019.Rate CNP PPAAlabama Power's retail rates, approved by the Alabama PSC, provide for adjustments under Rate CNP to recognize the placing of new generating facilities into retail service. Alabama Power may also recover retail costs associated with certificated PPAs under II-80 Table of Contents Index to Financial StatementsMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Alabama Power Company 2018 Annual ReportRate CNP PPA. No adjustments to Rate CNP PPA occurred during the period 2016 through 2018 and no adjustment is expected in 2019.In accordance with an accounting order issued in February 2017 by the Alabama PSC, Alabama Power reclassified $69 million of the December 31, 2016 Rate CNP PPA under recovered balance to a separate regulatory asset. The amortization of the new regulatory asset through Rate RSE will begin concurrently with the effective date of Alabama Power's next depreciation study, which is expected to occur no later than 2022.Rate CNP ComplianceRate CNP Compliance allows for the recovery of Alabama Power's retail costs associated with laws, regulations, and other such mandates directed at the utility industry involving the environment, security, reliability, safety, sustainability, or similar considerations impacting Alabama Power's facilities or operations. Rate CNP Compliance is based on forward-looking information and provides for the recovery of these costs pursuant to a factor that is calculated annually. Compliance costs to be recovered include operations and maintenance expenses, depreciation, and a return on certain invested capital. Revenues for Rate CNP Compliance, as recorded on the financial statements, are adjusted for differences in actual recoverable costs and amounts billed in current regulated rates. Accordingly, changes in the billing factor will have no significant effect on Alabama Power's revenues or net income, but will affect annual cash flow. Changes in Rate CNP Compliance-related operations and maintenance expenses and depreciation generally will have no effect on net income.In accordance with an accounting order issued in February 2017 by the Alabama PSC, Alabama Power reclassified $36 million of its under recovered balance in Rate CNP Compliance to a separate regulatory asset. The amortization of the new regulatory asset through Rate RSE will begin concurrently with the effective date of Alabama Power's next depreciation study, which is expected to occur no later than 2022.On November 30, 2018, Alabama Power submitted calculations associated with its cost of complying with environmental mandates, as provided under Rate CNP Compliance. The filing reflected a projected unrecovered retail revenue requirement for environmental compliance of approximately $205 million, which is being recovered in the billing months of January 2019 through December 2019.Rate ECRAlabama Power has established energy cost recovery rates under Alabama Power's Rate ECR as approved by the Alabama PSC. Rates are based on an estimate of future energy costs and the current over or under recovered balance. Revenues recognized under Rate ECR and recorded on the financial statements are adjusted for the difference in actual recoverable fuel costs and amounts billed in current regulated rates. The difference in the recoverable fuel costs and amounts billed give rise to the over or under recovered amounts recorded as regulatory assets or liabilities. Alabama Power, along with the Alabama PSC, continually monitors the over or under recovered cost balance to determine whether an adjustment to billing rates is required. Changes in the Rate ECR factor have no significant effect on Alabama Power's net income, but will impact operating cash flows. Currently, the Alabama PSC may approve billing rates under Rate ECR of up to 5.910 cents per KWH.In accordance with an accounting order issued in February 2017 by the Alabama PSC, Alabama Power reclassified $36 million of its under recovered balance in Rate ECR to a separate regulatory asset. The amortization of the new regulatory asset through Rate RSE will begin concurrently with the effective date of Alabama Power's next depreciation study, which is expected to occur no later than 2022. Alabama Power's current depreciation study became effective January 1, 2017.On May 1, 2018, the Alabama PSC approved an increase to Rate ECR from 2.015 cents per KWH to 2.353 cents per KWH effective July 2018 through December 2018. On December 4, 2018, the Alabama PSC issued a consent order to leave this rate in effect through December 31, 2019. This change is expected to increase collections by approximately $183 million in 2019. Absent any further order from the Alabama PSC, in January 2020, the rates will return to the originally authorized 5.910 cents per KWH.As discussed herein under ""Rate RSE,"" in accordance with an Alabama PSC order issued on February 5, 2019, Alabama Power will utilize $75 million of the 2018 Rate RSE refund liability to reduce the Rate ECR under recovered balance. Tax Reform Accounting OrderOn May 1, 2018, the Alabama PSC approved an accounting order that authorized Alabama Power to defer the benefits of federal excess deferred income taxes associated with the Tax Reform Legislation for the year ended December 31, 2018 as a regulatory liability and to use up to $30 million of such deferrals to offset under recovered amounts under Rate ECR. The estimated deferrals for the year ended December 31, 2018 totaled approximately $63 million, subject to adjustment following the filing of the 2018 tax return, of which $30 million was used to offset the Rate ECR under recovered balance and $33 million is recorded in other II-81 Table of Contents Index to Financial StatementsMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Alabama Power Company 2018 Annual Reportregulatory liabilities, deferred on the balance sheet to be used for the benefit of customers as determined by the Alabama PSC at a future date. See Note 10 to the financial statements under ""Current and Deferred Income Taxes"" for additional information.Software Accounting OrderOn February 5, 2019, the Alabama PSC approved an accounting order that authorizes Alabama Power to establish a regulatory asset for operations and maintenance costs associated with software implementation projects. The regulatory asset will be amortized ratably over the life of the related software.Plant Greene CountyAlabama Power jointly owns Plant Greene County with an affiliate, Mississippi Power. See Note 5 to the financial statements under ""Joint Ownership Agreements"" for additional information regarding the joint ownership agreement. On August 6, 2018, Mississippi Power filed its proposed Reserve Margin Plan (RMP) with the Mississippi PSC, which proposes a four-year acceleration of the retirement of Plant Greene County Units 1 and 2 to the third quarter 2021 and the third quarter 2022, respectively. Mississippi Power's proposed Plant Greene County unit retirements would require the completion of proposed transmission and system reliability improvements, as well as agreement by Alabama Power. Alabama Power will continue to monitor the status of Mississippi Power's proposed RMP and associated regulatory process as well as the proposed transmission and system reliability improvements. Alabama Power will review all the facts and circumstances and will evaluate all its alternatives prior to reaching a final determination on the ongoing operations of Plant Greene County. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.Request for Proposals for Future GenerationOn September 21, 2018, Alabama Power issued a request for proposals of between 100 MWs and 1,200 MWs of capacity beginning no later than 2023. On November 9, 2018, bids were received and an evaluation of those bids is in progress. Any purchases will depend upon the cost competitiveness of the respective offers as well as other options available to Alabama Power. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.Rate NDRBased on an order from the Alabama PSC, Alabama Power maintains a reserve for operations and maintenance expenses to cover the cost of damages from major storms to its transmission and distribution facilities. The order approves a separate monthly Rate NDR charge to customers consisting of two components. The first component is intended to establish and maintain a reserve balance for future storms and is an on-going part of customer billing. When the reserve balance falls below $50 million, a reserve establishment charge will be activated (and the on-going reserve maintenance charge concurrently suspended) until the reserve balance reaches $75 million. In December 2017, the reserve maintenance charge was suspended and the reserve establishment charge was activated as a result of the NDR balance falling below $50 million. Alabama Power expects to collect approximately $16 million annually until the reserve balance is restored to $75 million. The NDR balance at December 31, 2018 was $20 million and is included in other regulatory liabilities, deferred on the balance sheet.The second component of the Rate NDR charge is intended to allow recovery of any existing deferred storm-related operations and maintenance costs and any future reserve deficits over a 24-month period. The Alabama PSC order gives Alabama Power authority to record a deficit balance in the NDR when costs of storm damage exceed any established reserve balance. Absent further Alabama PSC approval, the maximum total Rate NDR charge consisting of both components is $10 per month per non-residential customer account and $5 per month per residential customer account. Alabama Power has the authority, based on an order from the Alabama PSC, to accrue certain additional amounts as circumstances warrant. As revenue from the Rate NDR charge is recognized, an equal amount of operations and maintenance expenses related to the NDR will also be recognized. As a result, the Rate NDR charge will not have an effect on net income but will impact operating cash flows.Environmental Accounting OrderBased on an order from the Alabama PSC (Environmental Accounting Order), Alabama Power is allowed to establish a regulatory asset to record the unrecovered investment costs, including the unrecovered plant asset balance and the unrecovered costs associated with site removal and closure associated with future unit retirements caused by environmental regulations. The regulatory asset is being amortized and recovered over the affected unit's remaining useful life, as established prior to the decision regarding early retirement through Rate CNP Compliance. At December 31, 2018, this regulatory asset had a balance of $42 million. See ""Environmental Matters – Environmental Laws and Regulations"" herein for additional information regarding environmental regulations.II-82 Table of Contents Index to Financial StatementsMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Alabama Power Company 2018 Annual ReportSubsequent to December 31, 2018, Alabama Power determined that Plant Gorgas Units 8, 9, and 10 (approximately 1,000 MWs) will be retired by April 15, 2019 due to the expected costs of compliance with federal and state environmental regulations. In accordance with the Environmental Accounting Order, approximately $740 million of net investment costs will be transferred to a regulatory asset at the retirement date and recovered over the affected units' remaining useful lives, as established prior to the decision to retire.Income Tax MattersFederal Tax Reform LegislationIn December 2017, the Tax Reform Legislation was signed into law and became effective on January 1, 2018. The Tax Reform Legislation, among other things, reduced the federal corporate income tax rate to 21%, retained normalization provisions for public utility property and existing renewable energy incentives, and repealed the corporate alternative minimum tax. In addition, under the Tax Reform Legislation, net operating losses (NOLs) generated after December 31, 2017 can no longer be carried back to previous tax years but can be carried forward indefinitely, with utilization limited to 80% of taxable income of the subsequent tax year. The projected reduction of Southern Company's consolidated income tax liability resulting from the tax rate reduction also delays the expected utilization of existing tax credit carryforwards. See Note 10 to the financial statements for information on Southern Company's joint consolidated income tax allocation agreement.Following the enactment of the Tax Reform Legislation, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin 118 – ""Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act"" (SAB 118), which provided for a measurement period of up to one year from the enactment date to complete accounting under GAAP for the tax effects of the legislation. Due to the complex and comprehensive nature of the enacted tax law changes and their application under GAAP, Alabama Power considered all amounts recorded in the financial statements as a result of the Tax Reform Legislation ""provisional"" as discussed in SAB 118 and subject to revision prior to filing its 2017 tax return in the fourth quarter 2018. Alabama Power recognized tax expense of $3 million in 2017 as a result of the Tax Reform Legislation. In addition, in total, Alabama Power recorded a $281 million decrease in regulatory assets and a $2.0 billion increase in regulatory liabilities as a result of the Tax Reform Legislation. As of December 31, 2018, Alabama Power considered the measurement of impacts from the Tax Reform Legislation on deferred income tax assets and liabilities, primarily due to the impact of the reduction of the corporate income tax rate, to be complete.However, the IRS continues to issue regulations that provide further interpretation and guidance on the law and each state's adoption of the provisions contained in the Tax Reform Legislation remains uncertain. The regulatory treatment of certain impacts of the Tax Reform Legislation is subject to the discretion of the FERC. The ultimate impact of this matter cannot be determined at this time. See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Alabama Power – Rate RSE"" for additional information regarding modifications to Rate RSE to reflect the impacts of the Tax Reform Legislation. Also see FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY – ""Credit Rating Risk"" herein and Note 10 to the financial statements under ""Current and Deferred Income Taxes"" for additional information.Bonus DepreciationUnder the Tax Reform Legislation, projects with binding contracts prior to September 28, 2017 and placed in service after September 27, 2017 remain eligible for bonus depreciation under the PATH Act. The PATH Act allowed for 50% bonus depreciation for 2015 through 2017, 40% bonus depreciation for 2018, and 30% bonus depreciation for 2019 and certain long-lived assets placed in service in 2020. Based on provisional estimates, bonus depreciation is expected to result in positive cash flows of approximately $100 million for the 2018 tax year and approximately $30 million for the 2019 tax year. See Note 10 to the financial statements under ""Current and Deferred Income Taxes"" for additional information. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.Other MattersAlabama Power is involved in various other matters being litigated and regulatory matters that could affect future earnings. In addition, Alabama Power is subject to certain claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. Alabama Power's business activities are subject to extensive governmental regulation related to public health and the environment, such as laws and regulations governing air, water, land, and protection of other natural resources. Litigation over environmental issues and claims of various types, including property damage, personal injury, common law nuisance, and citizen enforcement of environmental laws and regulations, has occurred throughout the U.S. This litigation has included claims for damages alleged to have been caused by CO2 and other emissions, CCR, and alleged exposure to hazardous materials, and/or requests for injunctive relief in connection with such matters.II-83 Table of Contents Index to Financial StatementsMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Alabama Power Company 2018 Annual ReportThe ultimate outcome of such pending or potential litigation or regulatory matters cannot be predicted at this time; however, for current proceedings not specifically reported herein or in Notes 2 and 3 to the financial statements, management does not anticipate that the ultimate liabilities, if any, arising from such current proceedings would have a material effect on Alabama Power's financial statements. See Notes 2 and 3 to the financial statements for a discussion of various other contingencies, regulatory matters, and other matters being litigated which may affect future earnings potential.ACCOUNTING POLICIESApplication of Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesAlabama Power prepares its financial statements in accordance with GAAP. Significant accounting policies are described in Notes 1, 5, and 6 to the financial statements. In the application of these policies, certain estimates are made that may have a material impact on Alabama Power's results of operations and related disclosures. Different assumptions and measurements could produce estimates that are significantly different from those recorded in the financial statements. Senior management has reviewed and discussed the following critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of Southern Company's Board of Directors.Utility RegulationAlabama Power is subject to retail regulation by the Alabama PSC and wholesale regulation by the FERC. As a result, Alabama Power applies accounting standards which require the financial statements to reflect the effects of rate regulation. Through the ratemaking process, the regulators may require the inclusion of costs or revenues in periods different than when they would be recognized by a non-regulated company. This treatment may result in the deferral of expenses and the recording of related regulatory assets based on anticipated future recovery through rates or the deferral of gains or creation of liabilities and the recording of related regulatory liabilities. The application of the accounting standards has a further effect on Alabama Power's financial statements as a result of the estimates of allowable costs used in the ratemaking process. These estimates may differ from those actually incurred by Alabama Power; therefore, the accounting estimates inherent in specific costs such as depreciation, AROs, and pension and other postretirement benefits have less of a direct impact on Alabama Power's results of operations and financial condition than they would on a non-regulated company.As reflected in Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Alabama Power – Regulatory Assets and Liabilities,"" significant regulatory assets and liabilities have been recorded. Management reviews the ultimate recoverability of these regulatory assets and any requirement to refund these regulatory liabilities based on applicable regulatory guidelines and GAAP. However, adverse legislative, judicial, or regulatory actions could materially impact the amounts of such regulatory assets and liabilities and could adversely impact Alabama Power's financial statements.Asset Retirement ObligationsAROs are computed as the fair value of the estimated costs for an asset's future retirement and are recorded in the period in which the liability is incurred. The estimated costs are capitalized as part of the related long-lived asset and depreciated over the asset's useful life. In the absence of quoted market prices, AROs are estimated using present value techniques in which estimates of future cash outlays associated with the asset retirements are discounted using a credit-adjusted risk-free rate. Estimates of the timing and amounts of future cash outlays are based on projections of when and how the assets will be retired and the cost of future removal activities.The liability for AROs primarily relates to the decommissioning of Alabama Power's nuclear facility, Plant Farley, and facilities that are subject to the CCR Rule and the related state rule, principally ash ponds. In addition, Alabama Power has AROs related to various landfill sites, underground storage tanks, asbestos removal related to ongoing repair and maintenance, disposal of polychlorinated biphenyls in certain transformers, and disposal of sulfur hexafluoride gas in certain substation breakers.Alabama Power also has identified retirement obligations related to certain transmission and distribution facilities, asbestos containing material within long-term assets not subject to ongoing repair and maintenance activities, and certain wireless communication towers. However, liabilities for the removal of these assets have not been recorded because the settlement timing for the retirement obligations related to these assets is indeterminable and, therefore, the fair value of the retirement obligations cannot be reasonably estimated. A liability for these retirement obligations will be recognized when sufficient information becomes available to support a reasonable estimation of the retirement obligation.The cost estimates for AROs related to the disposal of CCR are based on information using various assumptions related to closure and post-closure costs, timing of future cash outlays, inflation and discount rates, and the potential methods for complying with the CCR Rule requirements for closure in place. In June 2018, Alabama Power recorded increases of approximately $1.2 billion II-84 Table of Contents Index to Financial StatementsMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Alabama Power Company 2018 Annual Reportto its AROs related to the CCR Rule and approximately $300 million to its AROs related to updated nuclear decommissioning cost site studies. The revised CCR-related cost estimates as of June 30, 2018 were based on information from feasibility studies performed on ash ponds in use at the plants Alabama Power operates. During the second quarter 2018, Alabama Power's management completed its analysis of these studies which indicated that additional closure costs, primarily related to increases in estimated ash volume, water management requirements, and design revisions, will be required to close these ash ponds under the planned closure-in-place methodology. As the level of work becomes more defined in the next 12 months, it is likely that these cost estimates will change and the change could be material. Alabama Power expects to periodically update its ARO cost estimates. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – ""Environmental Matters – Environmental Laws and Regulations – Coal Combustion Residuals"" herein and Note 6 to the financial statements for additional information.Given the significant judgment involved in estimating AROs, Alabama Power considers the liabilities for AROs to be critical accounting estimates.Pension and Other Postretirement BenefitsAlabama Power's calculation of pension and other postretirement benefits expense is dependent on a number of assumptions. These assumptions include discount rates, healthcare cost trend rates, expected long-term return on plan assets, mortality rates, expected salary and wage increases, and other factors. Components of pension and other postretirement benefits expense include interest and service cost on the pension and other postretirement benefit plans, expected return on plan assets, and amortization of certain unrecognized costs and obligations. Actual results that differ from the assumptions utilized are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, generally affect recognized expense and the recorded obligation in future periods. While Alabama Power believes that the assumptions used are appropriate, differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions would affect its pension and other postretirement benefit costs and obligations.Key elements in determining Alabama Power's pension and other postretirement benefit expense are the expected long-term return on plan assets and the discount rate used to measure the benefit plan obligations and the periodic benefit plan expense for future periods. The expected long-term return on pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets is based on Southern Company's investment strategy, historical experience, and expectations for long-term rates of return that consider external actuarial advice. Southern Company determines the long-term return on plan assets by applying the long-term rate of expected returns on various asset classes to Southern Company's target asset allocation. For purposes of determining Alabama Power's liability related to the pension and other postretirement benefit plans, Southern Company discounts the future related cash flows using a single-point discount rate developed from the weighted average of market-observed yields for high quality fixed income securities with maturities that correspond to expected benefit payments.A 25 basis point change in any significant assumption (discount rate, salary increases, or long-term rate of return on plan assets) would result in a $9 million or less change in total annual benefit expense, a $99 million or less change in the projected obligation for the pension plan, and an $11 million or less change in the projected obligation for other post retirement benefit plans.Alabama Power recorded pension costs of $27 million, $9 million, and $11 million in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. Postretirement benefit costs for Alabama Power were $2 million, $3 million, and $4 million in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. Such amounts are dependent on several factors including trust earnings and changes to the plans. A portion of pension and other postretirement benefit costs is capitalized based on construction-related labor charges. Pension and other postretirement benefit costs are a component of the regulated rates and generally do not have a long-term effect on net income.See Note 11 to the financial statements for additional information regarding pension and other postretirement benefits.Contingent ObligationsAlabama Power is subject to a number of federal and state laws and regulations, as well as other factors and conditions that subject it to environmental, litigation, and other risks. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL herein and Notes 2 and 3 to the financial statements for more information regarding certain of these contingencies. Alabama Power periodically evaluates its exposure to such risks and records reserves for those matters where a non-tax-related loss is considered probable and reasonably estimable. The adequacy of reserves can be significantly affected by external events or conditions that can be unpredictable; thus, the ultimate outcome of such matters could materially affect Alabama Power's results of operations, cash flows, or financial condition.II-85 Table of Contents Index to Financial StatementsMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Alabama Power Company 2018 Annual ReportRecently Issued Accounting StandardsSee Note 1 to the financial statements under ""Recently Adopted Accounting Standards"" for additional information.In 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) (ASU 2016-02). ASU 2016-02 requires lessees to recognize on the balance sheet a lease liability and a right-of-use asset for all leases. ASU 2016-02 also changes the recognition, measurement, and presentation of expense associated with leases and provides clarification regarding the identification of certain components of contracts that would represent a lease. The accounting required by lessors is relatively unchanged. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 and Alabama Power adopted the new standard effective January 1, 2019.Alabama Power elected the transition methodology provided by ASU No. 2018-11, Leases (Topic 842): Targeted Improvements, whereby the requirements of ASU 2016-02 are applied on a prospective basis as of the adoption date of January 1, 2019, without restating prior periods. Alabama Power elected the package of practical expedients provided by ASU 2016-02 that allows prior determinations of whether existing contracts are, or contain, leases and the classification of existing leases to continue without reassessment. Additionally, Alabama Power applied the use-of-hindsight practical expedient in determining lease terms as of the date of adoption and elected the practical expedient that allows existing land easements not previously accounted for as leases not to be reassessed. Alabama Power also made accounting policy elections to account for short-term leases in all asset classes as off-balance sheet leases and combined lease and non-lease components in the computations of lease obligations and right-of-use assets for most asset classes.Alabama Power completed the implementation of a new application to track and account for its leases and updated its internal controls and accounting policies to support the accounting for leases under ASU 2016-02. Alabama Power completed its lease inventory and determined its most significant leases involve PPAs. In the first quarter 2019, the adoption of ASU 2016-02 resulted in recording lease liabilities and right-of-use assets on Alabama Power's balance sheet each totaling approximately $195 million, with no impact on Alabama Power's statement of income.FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITYOverviewAlabama Power's financial condition remained stable at December 31, 2018. Alabama Power's cash requirements primarily consist of funding ongoing operations, common stock dividends, capital expenditures, and debt maturities. Capital expenditures and other investing activities include investments to meet projected long-term demand requirements, to maintain existing generation facilities, to comply with environmental regulations including adding environmental modifications to certain existing generating units and closures of ash ponds, to expand and improve transmission and distribution facilities, and for restoration following major storms. Operating cash flows provide a substantial portion of Alabama Power's cash needs. For the three-year period from 2019 through 2021, Alabama Power's projected common stock dividends, capital expenditures, and debt maturities are expected to exceed operating cash flows. Alabama Power plans to finance future cash needs in excess of its operating cash flows primarily through external securities issuances, borrowings from financial institutions, or equity contributions from Southern Company. Alabama Power plans to use commercial paper to manage seasonal variations in operating cash flows and for other working capital needs. Alabama Power intends to continue to monitor its access to short-term and long-term capital markets as well as its bank credit arrangements to meet future capital and liquidity needs. See ""Sources of Capital,"" ""Financing Activities,"" and ""Capital Requirements and Contractual Obligations"" herein for additional information.Alabama Power's investments in the qualified pension plan and the nuclear decommissioning trust funds decreased in value as of December 31, 2018 as compared to December 31, 2017. No contributions to the qualified pension plan were made for the year ended December 31, 2018 and no mandatory contributions to the qualified pension plan are anticipated during 2019. Alabama Power's funding obligations for the nuclear decommissioning trust funds are based on the most recent site study completed in 2018, and the next study is expected to be conducted by 2023. See Notes 6 and 11 to the financial statements under ""Nuclear Decommissioning"" and ""Pension Plans,"" respectively, for additional information.Net cash provided from operating activities totaled $1.9 billion for 2018, an increase of $44 million as compared to 2017. The increase in cash provided from operating activities was primarily due to an increase in weather-related revenues, fuel cost recovery, and income tax refunds received in 2018, partially offset by materials and supplies purchases, the timing of vendor payments, and settlement of AROs. Net cash provided from operating activities totaled $1.8 billion for 2017, a decrease of $112 million as compared to 2017. The decrease in cash provided from operating activities was primarily due to the timing of income tax payments in 2017 and the receipt of income tax refunds in 2016 as a result of bonus depreciation, partially offset by the voluntary contribution to the qualified pension plan in 2016.II-86 Table of Contents Index to Financial StatementsMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Alabama Power Company 2018 Annual ReportNet cash used for investing activities totaled $2.3 billion for 2018, $1.9 billion for 2017, and $1.4 billion for 2016. These activities were primarily related to gross property additions for environmental, distribution, transmission, and steam generation assets. Net cash provided from financing activities totaled $177 million in 2018 primarily due to issuances of long-term debt and additional capital contributions from Southern Company, partially offset by the payment of common stock dividends and a maturity of long-term debt. Net cash provided from financing activities totaled $163 million in 2017 primarily due to issuances of long-term debt and additional capital contributions from Southern Company, partially offset by the payment of common stock dividends and maturities of long-term debt. Fluctuations in cash flow from financing activities vary from year to year based on capital needs and the maturity or redemption of securities.Significant balance sheet changes for 2018 included increases of $2.84 billion in property, plant, and equipment primarily due to $1.35 billion in AROs and additions to nuclear, distribution, and transmission assets. Other changes include $522 million in capital contributions from Southern Company and $295 million in long-term debt primarily due to a senior notes issuance. See Notes 6 and 8 to the financial statements for additional information related to changes in Alabama Power's AROs and financing activities, respectively.Alabama Power's ratio of common equity to total capitalization plus short-term debt was 47.0% and 46.3% at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. See Note 8 to the financial statements for additional information.Sources of CapitalAlabama Power plans to obtain the funds to meet its future capital needs from sources similar to those used in the past, which were primarily from operating cash flows, external security issuances, borrowings from financial institutions, and equity contributions from Southern Company. However, the amount, type, and timing of any future financings, if needed, will depend upon prevailing market conditions, regulatory approval, and other factors. Subsequent to December 31, 2018, Alabama Power received a capital contribution totaling $1.225 billion from Southern Company.Security issuances are subject to regulatory approval by the Alabama PSC. Additionally, with respect to the public offering of securities, Alabama Power files registration statements with the SEC under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The amounts of securities authorized by the Alabama PSC are continuously monitored and appropriate filings are made to ensure flexibility in the capital markets.Alabama Power obtains financing separately without credit support from any affiliate. See Note 8 to the financial statements under ""Bank Credit Arrangements"" for additional information. The Southern Company system does not maintain a centralized cash or money pool. Therefore, funds of Alabama Power are not commingled with funds of any other company in the Southern Company system.At December 31, 2018, Alabama Power's current liabilities exceeded current assets by $50 million. Alabama Power's current liabilities sometimes exceed current assets because of long-term debt maturities and the periodic use of short-term debt as a funding source, as well as significant seasonal fluctuations in cash needs.At December 31, 2018, Alabama Power had approximately $313 million of cash and cash equivalents. Committed credit arrangements with banks at December 31, 2018 were as follows:Expires Expires Within One Year2019 2020 2022 Total Unused Term Out No Term Out(in millions) (in millions) (in millions)$33 $500 $800 $1,333 $1,333 $— $33See Note 8 to the financial statements under ""Bank Credit Arrangements"" for additional information.Most of these bank credit arrangements, as well as Alabama Power's term loan arrangements, contain covenants that limit debt levels and contain cross-acceleration provisions to other indebtedness (including guarantee obligations) of Alabama Power. Such cross-acceleration provisions to other indebtedness would trigger an event of default if Alabama Power defaulted on indebtedness, the payment of which was then accelerated. At December 31, 2018, Alabama Power was in compliance with all such covenants. None of the bank credit arrangements contain material adverse change clauses at the time of borrowings.Subject to applicable market conditions, Alabama Power expects to renew or replace its bank credit arrangements as needed prior to expiration. In connection therewith, Alabama Power may extend the maturity dates and/or increase or decrease the lending commitments thereunder.II-87 Table of Contents Index to Financial StatementsMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Alabama Power Company 2018 Annual ReportA portion of the unused credit with banks is allocated to provide liquidity support to Alabama Power's pollution control revenue bonds and commercial paper programs. The amount of variable rate pollution control revenue bonds outstanding requiring liquidity support was $854 million at December 31, 2018.Alabama Power also has substantial cash flow from operating activities and access to the capital markets, including a commercial paper program, to meet liquidity needs. Alabama Power may meet short-term cash needs through its commercial paper program. Alabama Power may also meet short-term cash needs through a Southern Company subsidiary organized to issue and sell commercial paper at the request and for the benefit of Alabama Power and the other traditional electric operating companies. Proceeds from such issuances for the benefit of Alabama Power are loaned directly to Alabama Power. The obligations of each traditional electric operating company under these arrangements are several and there is no cross-affiliate credit support.Details of short-term borrowings were as follows: Short-term Debt at the End of the Period Short-term Debt During the Period (*) Amount Outstanding Weighted Average Interest Rate AverageAmount Outstanding WeightedAverageInterestRate MaximumAmountOutstanding (in millions) (in millions) (in millions)December 31, 2018$— —% $27 2.3% $258December 31, 2017$3 3.7% $25 1.3% $223December 31, 2016$— —% $16 0.6% $200(*)Average and maximum amounts are based upon daily balances during the 12-month periods ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016.Alabama Power believes that the need for working capital can be adequately met by utilizing commercial paper programs, lines of credit, and operating cash flows.Financing ActivitiesIn June 2018, Alabama Power issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of Series 2018A 4.300% Senior Notes due July 15, 2048. The proceeds were used to repay outstanding commercial paper and for general corporate purposes, including Alabama Power's continuous construction program.In October 2018, Alabama Power purchased and held $120 million aggregate principal amount of The Industrial Development Board of the City of Mobile, Alabama Pollution Control Revenue Bonds (Alabama Power Company Plant Barry Project), Series 2008. Alabama Power reoffered these bonds to the public in November 2018.In November 2018, Alabama Power guaranteed a $100 million three-year bank term loan for SEGCO. See Note 9 to the financial statements under ""Guarantees"" for additional information.Subsequent to December 31, 2018, Alabama Power repaid at maturity $200 million aggregate principal amount of Series Z 5.125% Senior Notes due February 15, 2019.In addition to any financings that may be necessary to meet capital requirements and contractual obligations, Alabama Power plans to continue, when economically feasible, a program to retire higher-cost securities and replace these obligations with lower-cost capital if market conditions permit.Credit Rating RiskAt December 31, 2018, Alabama Power did not have any credit arrangements that would require material changes in payment schedules or terminations as a result of a credit rating downgrade.II-88 Table of Contents Index to Financial StatementsMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Alabama Power Company 2018 Annual ReportThere are certain contracts that could require collateral, but not accelerated payment, in the event of a credit rating change to BBB and/or Baa2 or below. These contracts are primarily for physical electricity purchases, fuel purchases, fuel transportation and storage, energy price risk management, and transmission.The maximum potential collateral requirements under these contracts at December 31, 2018 were as follows:Credit RatingsMaximum PotentialCollateralRequirements (in millions)At BBB and/or Baa2$1At BBB- and/or Baa3$1Below BBB- and/or Baa3$356Included in these amounts are certain agreements that could require collateral in the event that either Alabama Power or Georgia Power (an affiliate of Alabama Power) has a credit rating change to below investment grade. Generally, collateral may be provided by a Southern Company guaranty, letter of credit, or cash. Additionally, a credit rating downgrade could impact the ability of Alabama Power to access capital markets and would be likely to impact the cost at which it does so.On September 28, 2018, Fitch assigned a negative rating outlook to the ratings of Southern Company and certain of its subsidiaries (including Alabama Power).Also on September 28, 2018, Moody's revised its rating outlook for Alabama Power from negative to stable.As a result of the Tax Reform Legislation, certain financial metrics, such as the funds from operations to debt percentage, used by the credit rating agencies to assess Southern Company and its subsidiaries, including Alabama Power, may be negatively impacted. The modifications to Rate RSE and other commitments approved by the Alabama PSC are expected to help mitigate these potential adverse impacts to certain credit metrics and will help Alabama Power meet its goal of achieving an equity ratio of approximately 55% by the end of 2025. See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Alabama Power – Rate RSE"" for additional information.Market Price RiskDue to cost-based rate regulation and other various cost recovery mechanisms, Alabama Power continues to have limited exposure to market volatility in interest rates, commodity fuel prices, and prices of electricity. To manage the volatility attributable to these exposures, Alabama Power nets the exposures, where possible, to take advantage of natural offsets and enters into various derivative transactions for the remaining exposures pursuant to Alabama Power's policies in areas such as counterparty exposure and risk management practices. Alabama Power's policy is that derivatives are to be used primarily for hedging purposes and mandates strict adherence to all applicable risk management policies. Derivative positions are monitored using techniques including, but not limited to, market valuation, value at risk, stress testing, and sensitivity analysis.To mitigate future exposure to changes in interest rates, Alabama Power may enter into derivatives designated as hedges. The weighted average interest rate on $1.1 billion of long-term variable interest rate exposure at December 31, 2018 was 2.5%. If Alabama Power sustained a 100 basis point change in interest rates for all long-term variable interest rate exposure, the change would affect annualized interest expense by approximately $11 million at December 31, 2018. See Note 1 to the financial statements under ""Financial Instruments"" and Note 14 to the financial statements for additional information.To mitigate residual risks relative to movements in electricity prices, Alabama Power enters into physical fixed-price contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity through the wholesale electricity market and financial hedge contracts for natural gas purchases. Alabama Power continues to manage a retail fuel-hedging program implemented per the guidelines of the Alabama PSC. Alabama Power had no material change in market risk exposure for the year ended December 31, 2018 when compared to the year ended December 31, 2017.In addition, Rate ECR allows the recovery of specific costs associated with the sales of natural gas that become necessary due to operating considerations at Alabama Power's electric generating facilities. Rate ECR also allows recovery of the cost of financial instruments used for hedging market price risk up to 75% of the budgeted annual amount of natural gas purchases. Alabama Power may not engage in natural gas hedging activities that extend beyond a rolling 42-month window. Also, the premiums paid for natural gas financial options may not exceed 5% of Alabama Power's natural gas budget for that year.II-89 Table of Contents Index to Financial StatementsMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Alabama Power Company 2018 Annual ReportThe changes in fair value of energy-related derivative contracts are substantially attributable to both the volume and the price of natural gas. For the years ended December 31, the changes in fair value of energy-related derivative contracts, the majority of which are composed of regulatory hedges, were as follows: 2018Changes 2017Changes Fair Value (in millions)Contracts outstanding at the beginning of the period, assets (liabilities), net$(6) $12Contracts realized or settled(2) (1)Current period changes(*)4 (17)Contracts outstanding at the end of the period, assets (liabilities), net$(4) $(6)(*)Current period changes also include the changes in fair value of new contracts entered into during the period, if any.The net hedge volumes of energy-related derivative contracts at December 31, 2018 and 2017 were as follows: 2018 2017 mmBtu Volume (in millions)Commodity – Natural gas swaps65 64Commodity – Natural gas options9 5Total hedge volume74 69The weighted average swap contract cost above market prices was approximately $0.08 per mmBtu at December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017. The change in option fair value is primarily attributable to the volatility of the market and the underlying change in the natural gas price. Substantially all of the natural gas hedge gains and losses are recovered through Alabama Power's retail energy cost recovery clause.At December 31, 2018 and 2017, substantially all of Alabama Power's energy-related derivative contracts were designated as regulatory hedges and were related to Alabama Power's fuel-hedging program. Therefore, gains and losses are initially recorded as regulatory liabilities and assets, respectively, and then are included in fuel expense as they are recovered through the energy cost recovery clause. Certain other gains and losses on energy-related derivatives, designated as cash flow hedges, are initially deferred in OCI before being recognized in income in the same period as the hedged transaction. Gains and losses on energy-related derivative contracts that are not designated or fail to qualify as hedges are recognized in the statements of income as incurred and were not material for any year presented.Alabama Power uses over-the-counter contracts that are not exchange traded but are fair valued using prices which are market observable, and thus fall into Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. See Note 13 to the financial statements for further discussion of fair value measurements. The maturities of the energy-related derivative contracts, which are primarily Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, at December 31, 2018 were as follows: Fair Value Measurements December 31, 2018 Total Maturity Fair Value Year 1 Years 2&3 (in millions)Level 1$— $— $—Level 2(4) (1) (3)Level 3— — —Fair value of contracts outstanding at end of period$(4) $(1) $(3)Alabama Power is exposed to market price risk in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to energy-related and interest rate derivative contracts. Alabama Power only enters into agreements and material transactions with counterparties that have II-90 Table of Contents Index to Financial StatementsMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Alabama Power Company 2018 Annual Reportinvestment grade credit ratings by Moody's and S&P, or with counterparties who have posted collateral to cover potential credit exposure. Therefore, Alabama Power does not anticipate market risk exposure from nonperformance by the counterparties. For additional information, see Note 1 to the financial statements under ""Financial Instruments"" and Note 14 to the financial statements.Capital Requirements and Contractual ObligationsThe construction program of Alabama Power is currently estimated to total $1.8 billion for 2019, $1.6 billion for 2020, $1.6 billion for 2021, $1.4 billion for 2022, and $1.5 billion for 2023. The construction program includes capital expenditures related to contractual purchase commitments for nuclear fuel and capital expenditures covered under LTSAs. Estimated capital expenditures to comply with environmental laws and regulations included in these amounts are $226 million for 2019, $68 million for 2020, $118 million for 2021, $112 million for 2022, and $111 million for 2023. These estimated expenditures do not include any potential compliance costs associated with pending regulation of CO2 emissions from fossil-fuel-fired electric generating units. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – ""Environmental Matters – Environmental Laws and Regulations"" and ""– Global Climate Issues"" herein for additional information.Alabama Power also anticipates costs associated with closure-in-place and monitoring of ash ponds in accordance with the CCR Rule, which are reflected in Alabama Power's ARO liabilities. These costs, which are expected to change and could change materially as underlying assumptions are refined and the cost, method, and timing of compliance activities continue to be evaluated, are currently estimated to be $232 million for 2019, $238 million for 2020, $246 million for 2021, $252 million for 2022, and $258 million for 2023. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – ""Environmental Matters – Environmental Laws and Regulations – Coal Combustion Residuals"" herein and Note 6 to the financial statements for additional information. Costs associated with the CCR Rule are expected to be recovered through Rate CNP Compliance.The construction program is subject to periodic review and revision, and actual construction costs may vary from these estimates because of numerous factors. These factors include: changes in business conditions; changes in load projections; changes in environmental laws and regulations; the outcome of any legal challenges to environmental rules; changes in generating plants, including unit retirements and replacements and adding or changing fuel sources at existing generating units, to meet regulatory requirements; changes in the expected environmental compliance program; changes in FERC rules and regulations; Alabama PSC approvals; changes in legislation; the cost and efficiency of construction labor, equipment, and materials; project scope and design changes; storm impacts; and the cost of capital. In addition, there can be no assurance that costs related to capital expenditures will be fully recovered.As a result of NRC requirements, Alabama Power has external trust funds for nuclear decommissioning costs; however, Alabama Power currently has no additional funding requirements. For additional information, see Note 6 to the financial statements under ""Nuclear Decommissioning.""In addition, as discussed in Note 11 to the financial statements, Alabama Power provides postretirement benefits to substantially all employees and funds trusts to the extent required by the Alabama PSC and the FERC.Funding requirements related to obligations associated with scheduled maturities of long-term debt, as well as the related interest, derivative obligations, pension and other postretirement benefit plans, preferred stock dividends, leases, other purchase commitments, and ARO settlements are detailed in the contractual obligations table that follows. See Notes 1, 6, 8, 9, 11, and 14 to the financial statements for additional information.II-91 Table of Contents Index to Financial StatementsMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Alabama Power Company 2018 Annual ReportContractual ObligationsContractual obligations at December 31, 2018 were as follows: 2019 2020- 2021 2022- 2023 After 2023 Total (in millions)Long-term debt(a) — Principal$200 $560 $1,050 $6,377 $8,187Interest330 630 575 4,751 6,286Preferred stock dividends(b)15 29 29 — 73Financial derivative obligations(c)4 6 — — 10Operating leases(d)12 17 9 1 39Capital lease1 1 1 1 4Purchase commitments — Capital(e)1,671 3,049 2,536 — 7,256Fuel(f)1,072 1,342 531 1,108 4,053Purchased power(g)83 178 140 512 913Other(h)42 61 61 277 441ARO settlements(i)232 485 510 — 1,227Pension and other postretirement benefit plans(j)16 32 — — 48Total$3,678 $6,390 $5,442 $13,027 $28,537(a)All amounts are reflected based on final maturity dates.

See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – ""Environmental Matters – Environmental Laws and Regulations – Coal Combustion Residuals"" herein and Note 6 to the financial statements for additional information.(j)Alabama Power forecasts contributions to the pension and other postretirement benefit plans over a three-year period. Alabama Power anticipates no mandatory contributions to the qualified pension plan during the next three years. Amounts presented represent estimated benefit payments for the nonqualified pension plans, estimated non-trust benefit payments for the other postretirement benefit plans, and estimated contributions to the other postretirement benefit plan trusts, all of which will be made from Alabama Power's corporate assets. See Note 11 to the financial statements for additional information related to the pension and other postretirement benefit plans, including estimated benefit payments. Certain benefit payments will be made through the related benefit plans. Other benefit payments will be made from Alabama Power's corporate assets.II-92 Table of Contents Index to Financial StatementsMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSGeorgia Power Company 2018 Annual ReportOVERVIEWBusiness ActivitiesGeorgia Power operates as a vertically integrated utility providing electric service to retail customers within its traditional service territory located within the State of Georgia and to wholesale customers in the Southeast.Many factors affect the opportunities, challenges, and risks of Georgia Power's business of providing electric service. These factors include the ability to maintain a constructive regulatory environment, to maintain and grow energy sales and customers, and to effectively manage and secure timely recovery of costs. These costs include those related to projected long-term demand growth, stringent environmental standards, including CCR rules, reliability, fuel, capital expenditures, including new generating facilities and expanding and improving transmission and distribution facilities, and restoration following major storms. Georgia Power has various regulatory mechanisms that operate to address cost recovery. Effectively operating pursuant to these regulatory mechanisms and appropriately balancing required costs and capital expenditures with customer prices will continue to challenge Georgia Power for the foreseeable future. On April 3, 2018, the Georgia PSC approved the Georgia Power Tax Reform Settlement Agreement, which provides for a total of $330 million in customer refunds for 2018 and 2019 and the deferral of certain revenues and tax benefits to be addressed in the Georgia Power 2019 Base Rate Case. The Georgia PSC also approved an increase to Georgia Power's retail equity ratio to address some of the negative cash flow and credit metric impacts of the Tax Reform Legislation. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – ""Retail Regulatory Matters – Rate Plans"" herein for additional information on the Georgia Power Tax Reform Settlement Agreement.Georgia Power continues to focus on several key performance indicators, including, but not limited to, customer satisfaction, plant availability, system reliability, the execution of major construction projects, and net income. Georgia Power's financial success is directly tied to customer satisfaction. Key elements of ensuring customer satisfaction include outstanding service, high reliability, and competitive prices. Management uses customer satisfaction surveys to evaluate Georgia Power's results and generally targets the top quartile of these surveys in measuring performance.See RESULTS OF OPERATIONS herein for information on Georgia Power's financial performance.Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 StatusIn 2009, the Georgia PSC certified construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 (with electric generating capacity of approximately 1,100 MWs each). Georgia Power holds a 45.7% ownership interest in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. In March 2017, the EPC Contractor filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. In December 2017, the Georgia PSC approved Georgia Power's recommendation to continue construction. The current expected in-service dates remain November 2021 for Unit 3 and November 2022 for Unit 4.In the second quarter 2018, Georgia Power revised its base capital cost forecast and estimated contingency to complete construction and start-up of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 to $8.0 billion and $0.4 billion, respectively, for a total project capital cost forecast of $8.4 billion (net of $1.7 billion received under the Guarantee Settlement Agreement and approximately $188 million in related Customer Refunds), with respect to Georgia Power's ownership interest. Although Georgia Power believes these incremental costs are reasonable and necessary to complete the project and the Georgia PSC's order in the seventeenth VCM proceeding specifically states that the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 is not subject to a cost cap, Georgia Power did not seek rate recovery for the $0.7 billion increase in costs included in the current base capital cost forecast (or any related financing costs) in the nineteenth VCM report that was approved by the Georgia PSC on February 19, 2019. In connection with future VCM filings, Georgia Power may request the Georgia PSC to evaluate costs currently included in the construction contingency estimate for rate recovery as and when they are appropriately included in the base capital cost forecast. After considering the significant level of uncertainty that exists regarding the future recoverability of costs included in the construction contingency estimate since the ultimate outcome of these matters is subject to the outcome of future assessments by management, as well as Georgia PSC decisions in these future regulatory proceedings, Georgia Power recorded a total pre-tax charge to income of $1.1 billion ($0.8 billion after tax) in the second quarter 2018.As a result of the increase in the total project capital cost forecast and Georgia Power's decision not to seek rate recovery of the increase in the base capital costs, the holders of at least 90% of the ownership interests in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 were required to vote to continue construction. On September 26, 2018, the Vogtle Owners unanimously voted to continue construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. In connection with the vote to continue construction, Georgia Power entered into (i) a binding term sheet (Vogtle Owner Term Sheet) with the other Vogtle Owners and certain of MEAG's wholly-owned subsidiaries, including MEAG Power SPVJ, LLC (MEAG SPVJ), to take certain actions which partially mitigate potential financial exposure for the other Vogtle Owners and (ii) a term sheet (MEAG Term Sheet) with MEAG and MEAG SPVJ to provide funding with respect to MEAG II-93 Table of Contents Index to Financial StatementsMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Georgia Power Company 2018 Annual ReportSPVJ's ownership interest in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 under certain circumstances. On January 14, 2019, Georgia Power, MEAG, and MEAG SPVJ entered into an agreement to implement the provisions of the MEAG Term Sheet. On February 18, 2019, Georgia Power, the other Vogtle Owners, and certain of MEAG's wholly-owned subsidiaries entered into certain amendments to their joint ownership agreements to implement the provisions of the Vogtle Owner Term Sheet.The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – ""Retail Regulatory Matters – Nuclear Construction"" herein for additional information on Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4.EarningsGeorgia Power's 2018 net income after dividends on preferred and preference stock was $0.8 billion, representing a $621 million, or 43.9%, decrease from the previous year. The decrease was due primarily to a $1.1 billion ($0.8 billion after tax) charge in the second quarter 2018 for an estimated probable loss related to Georgia Power's construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, revenues deferred as a regulatory liability for customer bill credits related to the Tax Reform Legislation, an adjustment for an expected refund to retail customers as a result of Georgia Power's retail ROE exceeding the allowed retail ROE range under the 2013 ARP in 2018, and higher non-fuel operations and maintenance expenses. Partially offsetting the decrease were lower federal income tax expense as a result of the Tax Reform Legislation and an increase in retail revenues associated with colder weather in the first quarter 2018 and warmer weather in the second and third quarters 2018 compared to the corresponding periods in 2017.Georgia Power's 2017 net income after dividends on preferred and preference stock was $1.4 billion, representing an $84 million, or 6.3%, increase from the previous year. The increase was due primarily to lower non-fuel operations and maintenance expenses, primarily as a result of cost containment and modernization initiatives, partially offset by lower revenues resulting from milder weather and lower customer usage as compared to 2016.RESULTS OF OPERATIONSA condensed income statement for Georgia Power follows: Amount Increase (Decrease)from Prior Year 2018 2018 2017 (in millions)Operating revenues$8,420 $110 $(73)Fuel1,698 27 (136)Purchased power1,153 115 159Other operations and maintenance1,860 136 (279)Depreciation and amortization923 28 40Taxes other than income taxes437 28 4Estimated loss on Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 41,060 1,060 —Total operating expenses7,131 1,394 (212)Operating income1,289 (1,284) 139Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized397 (22) 31Other income (expense), net115 11 23Income taxes214 (616) 50Net income793 (635) 81Dividends on preferred and preference stock— (14) (3)Net income after dividends on preferred and preference stock$793 $(621) $84II-94 Table of Contents Index to Financial StatementsMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Georgia Power Company 2018 Annual ReportOperating RevenuesOperating revenues for 2018 were $8.4 billion, reflecting a $110 million increase from 2017.

The significant factors driving this change are shown in the preceding table. The decrease in rates and pricing was primarily due to revenues deferred as a regulatory liability for customer bill credits related to the Tax Reform Legislation and an adjustment for an expected refund to retail customers as a result of Georgia Power's retail ROE exceeding the allowed retail ROE range under the 2013 ARP in 2018. See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Georgia Power – Rate Plans"" for additional information.Retail revenues of $7.7 billion in 2017 decreased $34 million, or 0.4%, compared to 2016. The significant factors driving this change are shown in the preceding table. The increase in rates and pricing was primarily due to an increase in revenues related to the recovery of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 construction financing costs under the NCCR tariff. See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Georgia Power – Nuclear Construction – Regulatory Matters"" for additional information on the NCCR tariff.See ""Energy Sales"" below for a discussion of changes in the volume of energy sold, including changes related to sales growth (decline) and weather.Electric rates include provisions to adjust billings for fluctuations in fuel costs, including the energy component of purchased power costs. Under these fuel cost recovery provisions, fuel revenues generally equal fuel expenses and do not affect net income. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – ""Retail Regulatory Matters – Fuel Cost Recovery"" herein for additional information.Wholesale revenues from power sales to non-affiliated utilities were as follows: 2018 2017 2016 (in millions)Capacity and other$54 $67 $72Energy109 96 103Total non-affiliated$163 $163 $175Wholesale capacity revenues from PPAs are recognized either on a levelized basis over the appropriate contract period or the amounts billable under the contract terms and provide for recovery of fixed costs and a return on investment. Wholesale revenues from sales to non-affiliates will vary depending on fuel prices, the market prices of wholesale energy compared to the cost of Georgia Power's and the Southern Company system's generation, demand for energy within the Southern Company system's electric service territory, and the availability of the Southern Company system's generation. Increases and decreases in energy revenues that are driven by fuel prices are accompanied by an increase or decrease in fuel costs and do not have a significant II-95 Table of Contents Index to Financial StatementsMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Georgia Power Company 2018 Annual Reportimpact on net income. Short-term opportunity sales are made at market-based rates that generally provide a margin above Georgia Power's variable cost of energy.Wholesale revenues from non-affiliated sales remained flat in 2018 as compared to 2017. Capacity revenues decreased $13 million, offset by a $13 million increase in energy revenues. The decrease in capacity revenues was primarily due to the expiration of a wholesale contract in the fourth quarter 2017. The increase in energy revenues was primarily due to increased demand, partially offset by the effects of expired contracts. Wholesale revenues from non-affiliated sales decreased $12 million, or 6.9%, in 2017 as compared to 2016. The decrease was related to decreases of $5 million in capacity revenues and $7 million in energy revenues. The decrease in capacity revenues reflects the expiration of wholesale contracts in the first and second quarters of 2016. The decrease in energy revenues was primarily due to lower demand and the effects of the expired contracts.Wholesale revenues from sales to affiliated companies will vary depending on demand and the availability and cost of generating resources at each company. These affiliate sales are made in accordance with the IIC, as approved by the FERC. These transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings since this energy is generally sold at marginal cost. In 2018, wholesale revenues from sales to affiliates decreased $2 million as compared to 2017. In 2017, wholesale revenues from sales to affiliates decreased $16 million as compared to 2016 due to a 42.8% decrease in KWH sales as a result of the lower market cost of available energy compared to the cost of Georgia Power-owned generation.Other operating revenues increased $98 million, or 25.6%, in 2018 from the prior year largely due to $94 million of revenues primarily from unregulated sales of products and services that were reclassified as other revenues as a result of the adoption of ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC 606). In prior periods, these revenues were included in other income (expense), net. See Note 1 to the financial statements for additional information regarding Georgia Power's adoption of ASC 606.Other operating revenues decreased $11 million, or 2.8%, in 2017 from the prior year primarily due to a $15 million decrease in open access transmission tariff revenues, primarily as a result of the expiration of long-term transmission services contracts, and a $14 million adjustment in 2016 for customer temporary facilities services revenues, partially offset by a $13 million increase in outdoor lighting sales revenues due to increased sales in new and replacement markets, primarily attributable to LED conversions.Energy SalesChanges in revenues are influenced heavily by the change in the volume of energy sold from year to year. KWH sales for 2018 and the percent change from the prior year were as follows: TotalKWHs Total KWHPercent Change Weather-AdjustedPercent Change 2018 2018 2017 2018 2017 (in billions) Residential28.3 8.4 % (5.2)% 2.6% (0.2)%Commercial33.0 2.5 (2.4) 1.6 (0.9)Industrial23.7 0.6 (1.0) 0.2 (0.1)Other0.5 (6.0) (4.2) (6.3) (4.0)Total retail85.5 3.8 (2.9) 1.5% (0.4)%Wholesale Non-affiliates3.2 (4.2) (4.0) Affiliates0.5 (34.2) (42.8) Total wholesale3.7 (10.1) (15.3) Total energy sales89.2 3.1 % (3.6)% Changes in retail energy sales are generally the result of changes in electricity usage by customers, changes in weather, and changes in the number of customers.In 2018, KWH sales for the residential class increased 8.4% compared to 2017 primarily due to colder weather in the first quarter 2018 and warmer weather in the second and third quarters 2018 compared to the corresponding periods in 2017. Weather-adjusted residential KWH sales and weather-adjusted commercial KWH sales increased by 2.6% and 1.6%, respectively, largely due to customer growth. Weather-adjusted industrial KWH sales were essentially flat primarily due to increased demand in the primary and fabricated metal sectors, offset by decreased demand in the textiles and stone, clay, and glass sectors. Additionally, customer usage for all customer classes increased due to the negative impacts of Hurricane Irma in 2017.II-96 Table of Contents Index to Financial StatementsMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Georgia Power Company 2018 Annual ReportIn 2017, KWH sales for the residential class decreased 5.2% compared to 2016 primarily due to milder weather in 2017. Weather-adjusted residential KWH sales decreased by 0.2% primarily due to a decline in average customer usage resulting from an increase in multi-family housing and energy saving initiatives, partially offset by customer growth. Weather-adjusted commercial KWH sales decreased by 0.9% primarily due to a decline in average customer usage resulting from an increase in electronic commerce transactions and energy saving initiatives, partially offset by customer growth. Weather-adjusted industrial KWH sales were essentially flat primarily due to decreased demand in the chemicals and paper sectors, offset by increased demand in the textile, non-manufacturing, and rubber sectors. Additionally, Hurricane Irma negatively impacted customer usage for all customer classes in 2017.See ""Operating Revenues"" above for a discussion of significant changes in wholesale sales to non-affiliates and affiliated companies.Fuel and Purchased Power ExpensesFuel costs constitute one of the largest expenses for Georgia Power. The mix of fuel sources for the generation of electricity is determined primarily by demand, the unit cost of fuel consumed, and the availability of generating units. Additionally, Georgia Power purchases a portion of its electricity needs from the wholesale market.Details of Georgia Power's generation and purchased power were as follows: 2018 2017 2016Total generation (in billions of KWHs)65.2 63.2 68.4Total purchased power (in billions of KWHs)27.9 26.9 24.8Sources of generation (percent) — Gas42 41 38Coal30 32 36Nuclear25 25 24Hydro3 2 2Cost of fuel, generated (in cents per net KWH) — Gas2.75 2.68 2.36Coal3.21 3.17 3.28Nuclear0.82 0.83 0.85Average cost of fuel, generated (in cents per net KWH)2.40 2.36 2.33Average cost of purchased power (in cents per net KWH)(*)4.79 4.62 4.53(*) Average cost of purchased power includes fuel purchased by Georgia Power for tolling agreements where power is generated by the provider.Fuel and purchased power expenses were $2.9 billion in 2018, an increase of $142 million, or 5.2%, compared to 2017. The increase was primarily due to a $74 million increase in the average cost of fuel and purchased power primarily related to higher natural gas and energy prices and an increase of $68 million related to the volume of KWHs generated and purchased primarily due to colder weather in the first quarter 2018 and warmer weather in the second and third quarters 2018 compared to the corresponding periods in 2017.Fuel and purchased power expenses were $2.7 billion in 2017, an increase of $23 million, or 0.9%, compared to 2016. The increase was primarily due to an $84 million increase in the average cost of fuel and purchased power primarily related to higher natural gas prices, partially offset by a net decrease of $61 million related to the volume of KWHs generated and purchased primarily due to milder weather, resulting in lower customer demand.Fuel and purchased power energy transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings since these fuel expenses are generally offset by fuel revenues through Georgia Power's fuel cost recovery mechanism. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – ""Retail Regulatory Matters – Fuel Cost Recovery"" herein for additional information.FuelFuel expense was $1.7 billion in 2018, an increase of $27 million, or 1.6%, compared to 2017. The increase was primarily due to an increase of 2.6% in the average cost of natural gas per KWH generated and an increase of 1.9% in the volume of KWHs generated largely due to colder weather in the first quarter 2018 and warmer weather in the second and third quarters 2018 compared to the corresponding periods in 2017. Fuel expense was $1.7 billion in 2017, a decrease of $136 million, or 7.5%, II-97 Table of Contents Index to Financial StatementsMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Georgia Power Company 2018 Annual Reportcompared to 2016. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease of 7.7% in the volume of KWHs generated largely due to milder weather, resulting in lower customer demand, partially offset by an increase of 13.6% in the average cost of natural gas per KWH generated.Purchased Power - Non-AffiliatesPurchased power expense from non-affiliates was $430 million in 2018, an increase of $14 million, or 3.4%, compared to 2017. The increase was primarily due to an 8.5% increase in the average cost per KWH purchased primarily due to higher energy prices, partially offset by a decrease of 3.8% in volume of KWHs purchased primarily due to the higher market cost of available energy as compared to Southern Company system resources. Purchased power expense from non-affiliates was $416 million in 2017, an increase of $55 million, or 15.2%, compared to 2016. The increase was primarily due to a 13.4% increase in the volume of KWHs purchased primarily due to unplanned outages at Georgia Power-owned generating units.Energy purchases from non-affiliates will vary depending on the market prices of wholesale energy as compared to the cost of the Southern Company system's generation, demand for energy within the Southern Company system's electric service territory, and the availability of the Southern Company system's generation.Purchased Power - AffiliatesPurchased power expense from affiliates was $723 million in 2018, an increase of $101 million, or 16.2%, compared to 2017. The increase was primarily due to a 6.3% increase in the volume of KWHs purchased due to colder weather in the first quarter 2018 and scheduled generation outages and warmer weather in the second and third quarters 2018 and a 3.0% increase in the average cost per KWH purchased primarily resulting from higher energy prices. Purchased power expense from affiliates was $622 million in 2017, an increase of $104 million, or 20.1%, compared to 2016. The increase was primarily due to a 7.0% increase in the volume of KWHs purchased to support Southern Company system transmission reliability and as a result of unplanned outages at Georgia Power-owned generating units and a 1.8% increase in the average cost per KWH purchased primarily resulting from higher natural gas prices.Energy purchases from affiliates will vary depending on the demand and the availability and cost of generating resources at each company within the Southern Company system. These purchases are made in accordance with the IIC or other contractual agreements, all as approved by the FERC.Other Operations and Maintenance ExpensesIn 2018, other operations and maintenance expenses increased $136 million, or 7.9%, compared to 2017. The increase was primarily due to $88 million of expenses from unregulated sales of products and services that were reclassified to other operations and maintenance expenses as a result of the adoption of ASC 606. In prior periods, these expenses were included in other income (expense), net. Also contributing to the increase were a $39 million decrease in gains on sales of assets and a $28 million increase in transmission and distribution overhead line maintenance, primarily related to additional vegetation management, partially offset by a decrease of $18 million associated with an employee attrition plan in 2017. See Note 1 to the financial statements for additional information regarding Georgia Power's adoption of ASC 606.In 2017, other operations and maintenance expenses decreased $279 million, or 13.9%, compared to 2016. The decrease was primarily due to cost containment and modernization activities implemented in the third quarter 2016 that contributed to decreases of $85 million in generation maintenance costs, $46 million in transmission and distribution overhead line maintenance, $22 million in employee benefits, and $22 million in customer accounts and sales costs. Other factors include a $40 million increase in gains on sales of assets, a $19 million decrease in scheduled generation outage costs, and a $15 million decrease in customer assistance expenses, primarily in demand-side management costs related to the timing of new programs.Depreciation and AmortizationDepreciation and amortization increased $28 million, or 3.1%, in 2018 compared to 2017. The increase was primarily due to additional plant in service.Depreciation and amortization increased $40 million, or 4.7%, in 2017 compared to 2016. The increase was primarily due to a $33 million increase related to additional plant in service and a $14 million decrease in amortization of regulatory liabilities related to other cost of removal obligations that expired in December 2016, partially offset by a $9 million decrease in depreciation related to generating unit retirements in 2016 and amortization of regulatory assets related to certain cancelled environmental and fuel conversion projects that expired in December 2016.See Note 5 to the financial statements under ""Depreciation and Amortization"" for additional information.II-98 Table of Contents Index to Financial StatementsMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Georgia Power Company 2018 Annual ReportTaxes Other Than Income TaxesIn 2018, taxes other than income taxes increased $28 million, or 6.8%, compared to 2017 primarily due to increases of $19 million in property taxes as a result of an increase in the assessed value of property and $11 million in municipal franchise fees largely related to higher retail revenues. In 2017, taxes other than income taxes increased $4 million, or 1.0%, compared to 2016.Estimated Loss on Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4In the second quarter 2018, an estimated probable loss of $1.1 billion was recorded to reflect Georgia Power's revised estimate to complete construction and start-up of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, which reflects the increase in costs included in the revised base capital cost forecast for which Georgia Power did not seek rate recovery and costs included in the revised construction contingency estimate for which Georgia Power may seek rate recovery as and when such costs are appropriately included in the base capital cost forecast. See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Georgia Power – Nuclear Construction"" for additional information.Interest Expense, Net of Amounts CapitalizedIn 2018, interest expense, net of amounts capitalized decreased $22 million, or 5.3%, compared to 2017 and increased $31 million, or 8.0%, compared to 2016 primarily due to changes in outstanding borrowings.Other Income (Expense), NetIn 2018, other income (expense), net increased $11 million compared to the prior year primarily due to an increase in AFUDC equity of $29 million resulting from a higher AFUDC rate due to a higher equity ratio and lower short-term borrowings, partially offset by a decrease of $21 million associated with revenues and expenses, net primarily from unregulated sales of products and services. In 2018, these revenues and expenses are included in other revenues and other operations and maintenance expenses, respectively, as a result of the adoption of ASC 606. See Note 1 to the financial statements for additional information regarding Georgia Power's adoption of ASC 606.In 2017, other income (expense), net increased $23 million compared to the prior year primarily due to a $28 million decrease in the non-service cost components of net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit costs, a $7 million increase in third party infrastructure services revenue, and a $6 million increase in wholesale operating fee revenue associated with contractual targets, partially offset by a $10 million increase in charitable donations and an $8 million decrease in AFUDC equity resulting from higher short-term borrowings. See Notes 1 under ""Recently Adopted Accounting Standards"" and 11 to the financial statements for additional information on Georgia Power's net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit costs.Income TaxesIncome taxes decreased $616 million, or 74.2%, in 2018 compared to the prior year primarily due to a lower federal income tax rate as a result of the Tax Reform Legislation and the reduction in pre-tax earnings resulting from the estimated probable loss related to Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4.Income taxes increased $50 million, or 6.4%, in 2017 compared to the prior year primarily due to higher pre-tax earnings, partially offset by an adjustment related to the Tax Reform Legislation.See Note 10 to the financial statements for additional information.Dividends on Preferred and Preference StockDividends on preferred and preference stock decreased $14 million, or 100.0%, in 2018 compared to 2017 and decreased $3 million, or 17.6%, in 2017 compared to 2016. The decreases were due to the redemption in October 2017 of all outstanding shares of Georgia Power's preferred and preference stock. See Note 8 to the financial statements under ""Outstanding Classes of Capital Stock – Georgia Power"" for additional information.Effects of InflationGeorgia Power is subject to rate regulation that is generally based on the recovery of historical and projected costs. The effects of inflation can create an economic loss since the recovery of costs could be in dollars that have less purchasing power. Any adverse effect of inflation on Georgia Power's results of operations has not been substantial in recent years.II-99 Table of Contents Index to Financial StatementsMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Georgia Power Company 2018 Annual ReportFUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIALGeneralGeorgia Power operates as a vertically integrated utility providing electric service to retail customers within its traditional service territory located in the State of Georgia and to wholesale customers in the Southeast. Prices for electricity provided by Georgia Power to retail customers are set by the Georgia PSC under cost-based regulatory principles. Retail rates and earnings are reviewed and may be adjusted periodically within certain limitations. Prices for wholesale electricity sales, interconnecting transmission lines, and the exchange of electric power are regulated by the FERC. See ACCOUNTING POLICIES – ""Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – Utility Regulation"" herein and Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Georgia Power"" for additional information about regulatory matters.The results of operations for the past three years are not necessarily indicative of future earnings potential. The level of Georgia Power's future earnings depends on numerous factors that affect the opportunities, challenges, and risks of Georgia Power's business of providing electric service. These factors include Georgia Power's ability to maintain a constructive regulatory environment that continues to allow for the timely recovery of prudently-incurred costs during a time of increasing costs, continued customer growth, and the weak pace of growth in electricity use per customer, especially in residential and commercial markets. Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 construction and rate recovery are also major factors. Earnings will also depend upon maintaining and growing sales, considering, among other things, the adoption and/or penetration rates of increasingly energy-efficient technologies, increasing volumes of electronic commerce transactions, and more multi-family home construction, all of which could contribute to a net reduction in customer usage. Earnings are subject to a variety of other factors. These factors include weather, competition, new energy contracts with other utilities, energy conservation practiced by customers, the use of alternative energy sources by customers, the price of electricity, the price elasticity of demand, and the rate of economic growth or decline in Georgia Power's service territory. Demand for electricity is primarily driven by the pace of economic growth that may be affected by changes in regional and global economic conditions, which may impact future earnings.Environmental MattersGeorgia Power's operations are regulated by state and federal environmental agencies through a variety of laws and regulations governing air, water, land, and protection of other natural resources. Georgia Power maintains comprehensive environmental compliance and GHG strategies to assess upcoming requirements and compliance costs associated with these environmental laws and regulations. The costs, including capital expenditures, operations and maintenance costs, and costs reflected in ARO liabilities, required to comply with environmental laws and regulations and to achieve stated goals may impact future electric generating unit retirement and replacement decisions, results of operations, cash flows, and/or financial condition. Related costs may result from the installation of additional environmental controls, closure and monitoring of CCR facilities, unit retirements, or changing fuel sources for certain existing units, as well as related upgrades to Georgia Power's transmission and distribution systems. A major portion of these costs is expected to be recovered through retail rates. The ultimate impact of environmental laws and regulations and the GHG goals discussed herein will depend on various factors, such as state adoption and implementation of requirements, the availability and cost of any deployed technology, fuel prices, and the outcome of pending and/or future legal challenges.New or revised environmental laws and regulations could affect many areas of Georgia Power's operations. The impact of any such changes cannot be determined at this time. Environmental compliance costs could affect earnings if such costs cannot continue to be recovered in rates on a timely basis. Georgia Power's Environmental Compliance Cost Recovery (ECCR) tariff allows for the recovery of capital and operations and maintenance costs related to environmental controls mandated by state and federal regulations. Further, increased costs that are recovered through regulated rates could contribute to reduced demand for electricity, which could negatively affect results of operations, cash flows, and/or financial condition. Additionally, many commercial and industrial customers may also be affected by existing and future environmental requirements, which for some may have the potential to ultimately affect their demand for electricity.Through 2018, Georgia Power has invested approximately $6.0 billion in environmental capital retrofit projects to comply with environmental requirements, with annual totals of approximately $0.5 billion, $0.3 billion, and $0.2 billion for 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. Although the timing, requirements, and estimated costs could change as environmental laws and regulations are adopted or modified, as compliance plans are revised or updated, and as legal challenges to rules are initiated or completed, Georgia Power's current compliance strategy estimates capital expenditures of $0.7 billion from 2019 through 2023, with annual totals of approximately $0.2 billion, $0.1 billion, $0.1 billion, $0.2 billion, and $0.1 billion for 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023, respectively. These estimates do not include any potential compliance costs associated with pending regulation of CO2 emissions from fossil fuel-fired electric generating units. See ""Global Climate Issues"" herein for additional information. Georgia Power also anticipates substantial expenditures associated with ash pond closure and ground water monitoring under the CCR Rule, which II-100 Table of Contents Index to Financial StatementsMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Georgia Power Company 2018 Annual Reportare reflected in Georgia Power's ARO liabilities. See FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY – ""Capital Requirements and Contractual Obligations"" herein and Note 6 to the financial statements for additional information.Environmental Laws and RegulationsAir QualityThe EPA has set National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for six air pollutants (carbon monoxide, lead, nitrogen dioxide, ozone, particulate matter, and SO2) to protect and improve the nation's air quality, which it reviews and revises periodically. Following a NAAQS revision, states are required to develop an EPA-approved plan to protect air quality. These state plans can require additional emission controls, improvements in control efficiency, or fuel changes which can result in increased compliance and operational costs. NAAQS requirements can also adversely affect the siting of new electric generating facilities. All areas within Georgia Power's service territory have been designated as attainment for all NAAQS except for a seven-county area within metropolitan Atlanta that is not in attainment with the 2015 ozone NAAQS and the area surrounding Plant Hammond, which will not be designated attainment or nonattainment for the 2010 SO2 standard until December 2020. If areas are designated as nonattainment in the future, increased compliance costs could result. See ""Retail Regulatory Matters – Integrated Resource Plan"" herein for information regarding Georgia Power's request to decertify and retire Plant Hammond.In 2011, the EPA finalized the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR) to address impacts of SO2 and NOX emissions from fossil fuel-fired electric generating plants. CSAPR establishes emissions trading programs and budgets for certain states and allocates emissions allowances for sources in those states. In 2016, the EPA published a final rule establishing more stringent ozone season NOX emissions budgets in Alabama. Georgia's ozone season NOX emissions budget remained unchanged. Increases in either future fossil fuel-fired generation or the availability or cost of CSAPR allowances could have a negative financial impact on results of operations for Georgia Power.The EPA finalized regional haze regulations in 2005 and 2017. These regulations require states, tribal governments, and various federal agencies to develop and implement plans to reduce pollutants that impair visibility and demonstrate reasonable progress toward the goal of restoring natural visibility conditions in certain areas, including national parks and wilderness areas. States must submit a revised state implementation plan (SIP) to the EPA demonstrating continued reasonable progress towards achieving visibility improvement goals. The EPA has approved the regional progress SIP for the State of Georgia.Water QualityIn 2014, the EPA finalized requirements under Section 316(b) of the Clean Water Act (CWA) to regulate cooling water intake structures (CWIS) to minimize their effects on fish and other aquatic life at existing power plants (e.g. coal, natural gas, oil, and nuclear generating plants) and manufacturing facilities. The regulation requires plant-specific studies to determine applicable CWIS changes to protect organisms that either get caught on the intake screens (impingement) or are drawn into the cooling system (entrainment). Georgia Power is conducting these studies and currently anticipates applicable CWIS changes may include fish-friendly CWIS screens with fish return systems and minor additions of monitoring equipment at certain plants. However, the ultimate impact of this rule will depend on the outcome of these plant-specific studies, any additional protective measures required to be incorporated into each plant's National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit based on site-specific factors, and the outcome of any legal challenges.In 2015, the EPA finalized the steam electric effluent limitations guidelines (ELG) rule (2015 ELG Rule) that set national standards for wastewater discharges from new and existing steam electric generating units generating greater than 50 MWs. The 2015 ELG Rule prohibits effluent discharges of certain waste streams and imposes stringent limits on flue gas desulfurization (scrubber) wastewater discharges. The revised technology-based limits and the CCR Rule require extensive changes to existing ash and wastewater management systems or the installation and operation of new ash and wastewater management systems. Compliance with the 2015 ELG Rule is expected to require capital expenditures and increased operational costs primarily for Georgia Power's coal-fired electric generation. State environmental agencies will incorporate specific compliance applicability dates in the NPDES permitting process for each ELG waste stream no later than December 31, 2023. The EPA is scheduled to issue a new rulemaking by December 2019 that could revise the limitations and applicability dates of two of the waste streams regulated in the 2015 ELG Rule. The impact of any changes to the 2015 ELG Rule will depend on the content of the new rule and the outcome of any legal challenges.In 2015, the EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) jointly published a final rule that revised the regulatory definition of waters of the United States (WOTUS) for all CWA programs. The rule significantly expanded the scope of federal jurisdiction over waterbodies (such as rivers, streams, canals, and wastewater treatment ponds), which could impact new generation projects and permitting and reporting requirements associated with the installation, expansion, and maintenance of transmission and distribution projects. The EPA and the Corps are expected to publish a final rule in 2019 to replace the 2015 II-101 Table of Contents Index to Financial StatementsMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Georgia Power Company 2018 Annual ReportWOTUS definition. The impact of any changes to the 2015 WOTUS rule will depend on the content of this final rule and the outcome of any legal challenges.Coal Combustion ResidualsIn 2015, the EPA finalized non-hazardous solid waste regulations for the disposal of CCR, including coal ash and gypsum, in landfills and surface impoundments (ash ponds) at active generating power plants. In addition to the EPA's CCR Rule, the State of Georgia has also finalized its own regulations regarding the handling of CCR. The EPA's CCR Rule requires landfills and ash ponds to be evaluated against a set of performance criteria and potentially closed if minimum criteria are not met. Closure of existing landfills and ash ponds could require installation of equipment and infrastructure to manage CCR in accordance with the CCR Rule. Based on cost estimates for closure and monitoring of landfills and ash ponds pursuant to the CCR Rule, Georgia Power recorded an update to the AROs for each CCR unit in 2015. As further analysis is performed and closure details are developed, Georgia Power has continued to periodically update these cost estimates, as discussed further below.The EPA published certain amendments to the CCR Rule, which became effective August 29, 2018. These amendments extend the date from April 2019 to October 31, 2020 to cease sending CCR and other waste streams to ash ponds that demonstrate compliance with all except two of the specified performance criteria. However, the Georgia Department of Natural Resources has not incorporated these amendments into its state CCR rule.On August 21, 2018, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit issued a decision suggesting the EPA should regulate previously-excluded inactive ash ponds located at retired generation facilities and questioning both the ability of unlined ash ponds to continue operating no matter the performance criteria results and the classification of clay-lined landfills and ash ponds. These developments could impact the expected timing of Georgia Power's landfill and ash pond closure activities, but the extent of any impact will depend on the outcome of ongoing litigation, anticipated EPA rulemaking action to establish further guidance, and the outcome of any legal challenges.In December 2018, Georgia Power recorded an increase of approximately $3.1 billion to its AROs related to the CCR Rule and the related state rule. During the second half of 2018, Georgia Power completed a strategic assessment related to its plans to close the ash ponds at all of its generating plants in compliance with the CCR Rule and the related state rule. This assessment included engineering and constructability studies related to design assumptions for ash pond closures and advanced engineering methods. The results indicated that additional closure costs will be required to close these ash ponds, primarily due to changes in closure strategies, the estimated amount of ash to be excavated, and additional water management requirements necessary to support closure strategies. These factors also impact the estimated timing of future cash outlays.Georgia Power expects to periodically update its ARO cost estimates. Absent continued recovery of ARO costs through regulated rates, Georgia Power's results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition could be materially impacted. See ""Retail Regulatory Matters – Integrated Resource Plan"" and FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY – ""Capital Requirements and Contractual Obligations"" herein and Note 6 to the financial statements for additional information.The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.Nuclear DecommissioningIn December 2018, Georgia Power completed updated decommissioning cost site studies for Plant Hatch and Plant Vogtle Units 1 and 2. The estimated cost of decommissioning based on the studies resulted in an increase in Georgia Power's ARO liability of approximately $130 million. Georgia Power currently collects $4 million and $2 million annually in rates, which is used to fund external nuclear decommissioning trusts for Plant Hatch and Plant Vogtle Units 1 and 2, respectively. Georgia Power expects the Georgia PSC to review and adjust, if necessary, these amounts in the Georgia Power 2019 Base Rate Case. See Note 6 to the financial statements for additional information.Environmental RemediationGeorgia Power must comply with environmental laws and regulations governing the handling and disposal of waste and releases of hazardous substances. Under these various laws and regulations, Georgia Power may also incur substantial costs to clean up affected sites. Georgia Power conducts studies to determine the extent of any required cleanup and has recognized the estimated costs to clean up known impacted sites in its financial statements. Amounts for cleanup and ongoing monitoring costs were not material for any year presented. Georgia Power has received authority from the Georgia PSC to recover approved environmental compliance costs through regulatory mechanisms. Georgia Power may be liable for some or all required cleanup costs for additional sites that may require environmental remediation. See Note 3 to the financial statements under ""Environmental Remediation"" for additional information.II-102 Table of Contents Index to Financial StatementsMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Georgia Power Company 2018 Annual ReportGlobal Climate IssuesOn August 31, 2018, the EPA published a proposed rule known as the Affordable Clean Energy (ACE) Rule, which is intended to replace a regulation enacted in 2015 known as the Clean Power Plan (CPP), that would limit CO2 emissions from existing fossil fuel-fired electric generating units. The CPP has been stayed by the U.S. Supreme Court since 2016. The ACE Rule would require states to develop GHG unit-specific emission rate standards based on heat-rate efficiency improvements for existing fossil fuel-fired steam units. As proposed, combustion turbines, including natural gas combined cycles, are not affected sources. As of January 1, 2019, Georgia Power has ownership interests in 20 fossil fuel-fired steam units to which the proposed ACE Rule is applicable. The ultimate impact of this rule to Georgia Power is currently unknown and will depend on changes between the proposal and the final rule, subsequent state plan developments and requirements, and any associated legal challenges.On December 20, 2018, the EPA published a proposed review of the Standards of Performance for Greenhouse Gas Emissions from New, Modified, and Reconstructed Stationary Sources: Electric Utility Generating Units final rule (2015 NSPS rule). The EPA's final 2015 NSPS rule set standards of performance for new, modified, and reconstructed electric utility generating units which included stationary combustion turbines and fossil-fired steam boilers. This proposal reduces the stringency of the 2015 NSPS rule by not basing the new and reconstructed fossil-fired steam boiler and IGCC standards on partial carbon capture and sequestration. The impact of any changes to this rule will depend on the content of the final rule and the outcome of any legal challenges.The EPA's GHG reporting rule requires annual reporting of GHG emissions expressed in terms of metric tons of CO2 equivalent emissions for a company's operational control of facilities. Based on ownership or financial control of facilities, Georgia Power's 2017 GHG emissions were approximately 30 million metric tons of CO2 equivalent. The preliminary estimate of Georgia Power's 2018 GHG emissions on the same basis is approximately 30 million metric tons of CO2 equivalent.Through 2017, the Southern Company system has achieved an estimated GHG emission reduction of 36% since 2007. In April 2018, Southern Company established an intermediate goal of a 50% reduction in carbon emissions from 2007 levels by 2030 and a long-term goal of low- to no-carbon operations by 2050. To achieve these goals, the Southern Company system expects to continue growing its renewable energy portfolio, optimize technology advancements to modernize its transmission and distribution systems, increase the use of natural gas for generation, complete ongoing construction projects, including Georgia Power's interest in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, invest in energy efficiency, and continue research and development efforts focused on technologies to lower GHG emissions. The Southern Company system's ability to achieve these goals also will be dependent on many external factors, including supportive national energy policies, low natural gas prices, and the development, deployment, and advancement of relevant energy technologies.FERC MattersOn May 10, 2018, AMEA and Cooperative Energy filed with the FERC a complaint against SCS and the traditional electric operating companies (including Georgia Power) claiming that the current 11.25% base ROE used in calculating the annual transmission revenue requirements of the traditional electric operating companies' (including Georgia Power's) open access transmission tariff is unjust and unreasonable as measured by the applicable FERC standards. The complaint requested that the base ROE be set no higher than 8.65% and that the FERC order refunds for the difference in revenue requirements that results from applying a just and reasonable ROE established in this proceeding upon determining the current ROE is unjust and unreasonable. On June 18, 2018, SCS and the traditional electric operating companies (including Georgia Power) filed their response challenging the adequacy of the showing presented by the complainants and offering support for the current ROE. On September 6, 2018, the FERC issued an order establishing a refund effective date of May 10, 2018 in the event a refund is due and initiating an investigation and settlement procedures regarding the current base ROE. Through December 31, 2018, the estimated maximum potential refund is not expected to be material to Georgia Power's results of operations or cash flows. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.Retail Regulatory MattersGeorgia Power's revenues from regulated retail operations are collected through various rate mechanisms subject to the oversight of the Georgia PSC. Georgia Power currently recovers its costs from the regulated retail business through the 2013 ARP, which includes traditional base tariff rates, Demand-Side Management (DSM) tariffs, ECCR tariffs, and Municipal Franchise Fee (MFF) tariffs. Georgia Power is scheduled to file a base rate case by July 1, 2019, which may continue or modify these tariffs. In addition, financing costs on certified construction costs of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 are being collected through the NCCR tariff and fuel costs are collected through a separate fuel cost recovery tariff. See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Georgia Power – Rate Plans,"" "" – Fuel Cost Recovery,"" and "" – Nuclear Construction"" for additional information.II-103 Table of Contents Index to Financial StatementsMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Georgia Power Company 2018 Annual ReportOn November 16, 2018, Georgia Power completed the sale of its natural gas lateral pipeline serving Plant McDonough Units 4 through 6 to SNG at net book value, as approved by the Georgia PSC on January 16, 2018. Georgia Power expects payment of $142 million from SNG to occur in the first quarter 2020. During the interim period, Georgia Power will receive a discounted shipping rate to reflect the delayed consideration. Southern Company Gas, an affiliate of Georgia Power, owns a 50% equity interest in SNG.Rate PlansPursuant to the terms and conditions of a settlement agreement related to Southern Company's acquisition of Southern Company Gas approved by the Georgia PSC in 2016, the 2013 ARP will continue in effect until December 31, 2019, and Georgia Power will be required to file its next base rate case by July 1, 2019. Furthermore, through December 31, 2019, Georgia Power will retain its merger savings, net of transition costs, as defined in the settlement agreement; through December 31, 2022, such net merger savings will be shared on a 60/40 basis with customers; thereafter, all merger savings will be retained by customers.There were no changes to Georgia Power's traditional base tariff rates, ECCR tariff, DSM tariffs, or MFF tariff in 2017 or 2018.Under the 2013 ARP, Georgia Power's retail ROE is set at 10.95% and earnings are evaluated against a retail ROE range of 10.00% to 12.00%. Two-thirds of any earnings above 12.00% will be directly refunded to customers, with the remaining one-third retained by Georgia Power. There will be no recovery of any earnings shortfall below 10.00% on an actual basis. In 2016, Georgia Power's retail ROE exceeded 12.00%, and Georgia Power refunded to retail customers in 2018 approximately $40 million as approved by the Georgia PSC. On February 5, 2019, the Georgia PSC approved a settlement between Georgia Power and the staff of the Georgia PSC under which Georgia Power's retail ROE for 2017 was stipulated to exceed 12.00% and Georgia Power will reduce certain regulatory assets by approximately $4 million in lieu of providing refunds to retail customers. In 2018, Georgia Power's retail ROE exceeded 12.00%, and Georgia Power accrued approximately $100 million to refund to retail customers, subject to review and approval by the Georgia PSC.On April 3, 2018, the Georgia PSC approved the Georgia Power Tax Reform Settlement Agreement. Pursuant to the Georgia Power Tax Reform Settlement Agreement, to reflect the federal income tax rate reduction impact of the Tax Reform Legislation, Georgia Power will refund to customers a total of $330 million through bill credits. Georgia Power issued bill credits of approximately $130 million in 2018 and will issue bill credits of approximately $95 million in June 2019 and $105 million in February 2020. In addition, Georgia Power is deferring as a regulatory liability (i) the revenue equivalent of the tax expense reduction resulting from legislation lowering the Georgia state income tax rate from 6.00% to 5.75% in 2019 and (ii) the entire benefit of federal and state excess accumulated deferred income taxes, which is expected to total approximately $700 million at December 31, 2019. At December 31, 2018, the related regulatory liability balance totaled $610 million. The amortization of these regulatory liabilities is expected to be addressed in the Georgia Power 2019 Base Rate Case. If there is not a base rate case in 2019, customers will receive $185 million in annual bill credits beginning in 2020, with any additional federal and state income tax savings deferred as a regulatory liability, until Georgia Power's next base rate case.To address some of the negative cash flow and credit quality impacts of the Tax Reform Legislation, the Georgia PSC also approved an increase in Georgia Power's retail equity ratio to the lower of (i) Georgia Power's actual common equity weight in its capital structure or (ii) 55%, until the Georgia Power 2019 Base Rate Case. At December 31, 2018, Georgia Power's actual retail common equity ratio (on a 13-month average basis) was approximately 55%. Benefits from reduced federal income tax rates in excess of the amounts refunded to customers will be retained by Georgia Power to cover the carrying costs of the incremental equity in 2018 and 2019.Integrated Resource PlanSee ""Environmental Matters"" herein for additional information regarding proposed and final EPA rules and regulations, including revisions to ELG for steam electric power plants and additional regulations of CCR and CO2.In 2016, the Georgia PSC approved Georgia Power's triennial Integrated Resource Plan (2016 IRP) including the reclassification of the remaining net book value of Plant Mitchell Unit 3 and costs associated with materials and supplies remaining at the unit retirement date to a regulatory asset. Recovery of the unit's net book value will continue through December 31, 2019, as provided in the 2013 ARP. The timing of the recovery of the remaining balance of the unit's net book value as of December 31, 2019 and costs associated with materials and supplies remaining at the unit retirement date was deferred for consideration in the Georgia Power 2019 Base Rate Case.In the 2016 IRP, the Georgia PSC also approved recovery of costs up to $99 million through June 30, 2019 to preserve nuclear generation as an option at a future generation site in Stewart County, Georgia. In March 2017, the Georgia PSC approved Georgia Power's decision to suspend work at the site due to changing economics, including lower load forecasts and fuel costs. The timing II-104 Table of Contents Index to Financial StatementsMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Georgia Power Company 2018 Annual Reportof recovery for costs incurred of approximately $50 million is expected to be determined by the Georgia PSC in the Georgia Power 2019 Base Rate Case.On January 31, 2019, Georgia Power filed its triennial IRP (2019 IRP). The filing includes a request to decertify and retire Plant Hammond Units 1 through 4 (840 MWs) and Plant McIntosh Unit 1 (142.5 MWs) upon approval of the 2019 IRP.In the 2019 IRP, Georgia Power requested approval to reclassify the remaining net book value of Plant Hammond Units 1 through 4 (approximately $520 million at December 31, 2018) upon retirement to a regulatory asset to be amortized ratably over a period equal to the applicable unit's remaining useful life through 2035. For Plant McIntosh Unit 1, Georgia Power requested approval to reclassify the remaining net book value (approximately $40 million at December 31, 2018) upon retirement to a regulatory asset to be amortized over a three-year period to be determined in the Georgia Power 2019 Base Rate Case. Georgia Power also requested approval to reclassify any unusable material and supplies inventory balances remaining at the applicable unit's retirement date to a regulatory asset for recovery over a period to be determined in the Georgia Power 2019 Base Rate Case.The 2019 IRP also includes a request to certify approximately 25 MWs of capacity at Plant Scherer Unit 3 for the retail jurisdiction beginning January 1, 2020, following the expiration of a wholesale PPA.The 2019 IRP also includes details regarding ARO costs associated with ash pond and landfill closures and post-closure care. Georgia Power requested the timing and rate of recovery of these costs be determined by the Georgia PSC in the Georgia Power 2019 Base Rate Case. See ""Environmental Matters – Environmental Laws and Regulations – Coal Combustion Residuals"" and FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY – ""Capital Requirements and Contractual Obligations"" herein and Note 6 to the financial statements for additional information regarding Georgia Power's AROs.Georgia Power also requested approval to issue two capacity-based requests for proposals (RFP). If approved, the first capacity-based RFP will seek resources that can provide capacity beginning in 2022 or 2023 and the second capacity-based RFP will seek resources that can provide capacity beginning in 2026, 2027, or 2028. Additionally, the 2019 IRP includes a request to procure an additional 1,000 MWs of renewable resources through a competitive bidding process. Georgia Power also proposed to invest in a portfolio of up to 50 MWs of battery energy storage technologies.A decision from the Georgia PSC on the 2019 IRP is expected in mid-2019. The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.Fuel Cost RecoveryGeorgia Power has established fuel cost recovery rates approved by the Georgia PSC. On August 16, 2018, the Georgia PSC approved the deferral of Georgia Power's next fuel case to no later than March 16, 2020, with new rates, if any, to be effective June 1, 2020. Georgia Power continues to be allowed to adjust its fuel cost recovery rates under an interim fuel rider prior to the next fuel case if the under or over recovered fuel balance exceeds $200 million. At December 31, 2018, Georgia Power's under recovered fuel balance was $115 million.Georgia Power's fuel cost recovery mechanism includes costs associated with a natural gas hedging program, as revised and approved by the Georgia PSC, allowing the use of an array of derivative instruments within a 48-month time horizon.Fuel cost recovery revenues as recorded on the financial statements are adjusted for differences in actual recoverable fuel costs and amounts billed in current regulated rates. Accordingly, changes in the billing factor will not have a significant effect on Georgia Power's revenues or net income, but will affect operating cash flows. Storm Damage RecoveryGeorgia Power is accruing $30 million annually through December 31, 2019, as provided in the 2013 ARP, for incremental operations and maintenance costs of damage from major storms to its transmission and distribution facilities. At December 31, 2018, the total balance in the regulatory asset related to storm damage was $416 million. During October 2018, Hurricane Michael caused significant damage to Georgia Power's transmission and distribution facilities. The incremental restoration costs related to this hurricane deferred in the regulatory asset for storm damage totaled approximately $115 million. Hurricanes Irma and Matthew also caused significant damage to Georgia Power's transmission and distribution facilities during September 2017 and October 2016, respectively. The incremental restoration costs related to Hurricanes Irma and Matthew deferred in the regulatory asset for storm damage totaled approximately $250 million. The rate of storm damage cost recovery is expected to be adjusted as part of the Georgia Power 2019 Base Rate Case and further adjusted in future regulatory proceedings as necessary. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time. See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Georgia Power – Storm Damage Recovery"" for additional information regarding Georgia Power's storm damage reserve.II-105 Table of Contents Index to Financial StatementsMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Georgia Power Company 2018 Annual ReportNuclear ConstructionIn 2009, the Georgia PSC certified construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Georgia Power holds a 45.7% ownership interest in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. In 2012, the NRC issued the related combined construction and operating licenses, which allowed full construction of the two AP1000 nuclear units (with electric generating capacity of approximately 1,100 MWs each) and related facilities to begin. Until March 2017, construction on Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 continued under the Vogtle 3 and 4 Agreement, which was a substantially fixed price agreement. In March 2017, the EPC Contractor filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.In connection with the EPC Contractor's bankruptcy filing, Georgia Power, acting for itself and as agent for the Vogtle Owners, entered into the Interim Assessment Agreement with the EPC Contractor to allow construction to continue. The Interim Assessment Agreement expired in July 2017 when Georgia Power, acting for itself and as agent for the other Vogtle Owners, and the EPC Contractor entered into the Vogtle Services Agreement. Under the Vogtle Services Agreement, Westinghouse provides facility design and engineering services, procurement and technical support, and staff augmentation on a time and materials cost basis. The Vogtle Services Agreement provides that it will continue until the start-up and testing of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 are complete and electricity is generated and sold from both units. The Vogtle Services Agreement is terminable by the Vogtle Owners upon 30 days' written notice.In October 2017, Georgia Power, acting for itself and as agent for the other Vogtle Owners, executed the Bechtel Agreement, a cost reimbursable plus fee arrangement, whereby Bechtel is reimbursed for actual costs plus a base fee and an at-risk fee, which is subject to adjustment based on Bechtel's performance against cost and schedule targets. Each Vogtle Owner is severally (not jointly) liable for its proportionate share, based on its ownership interest, of all amounts owed to Bechtel under the Bechtel Agreement. The Vogtle Owners may terminate the Bechtel Agreement at any time for their convenience, provided that the Vogtle Owners will be required to pay amounts related to work performed prior to the termination (including the applicable portion of the base fee), certain termination-related costs, and, at certain stages of the work, the applicable portion of the at-risk fee. Bechtel may terminate the Bechtel Agreement under certain circumstances, including certain Vogtle Owner suspensions of work, certain breaches of the Bechtel Agreement by the Vogtle Owners, Vogtle Owner insolvency, and certain other events. Pursuant to the Loan Guarantee Agreement between Georgia Power and the DOE, Georgia Power is required to obtain the DOE's approval of the Bechtel Agreement prior to obtaining any further advances under the Loan Guarantee Agreement.Cost and ScheduleGeorgia Power's approximate proportionate share of the remaining estimated capital cost to complete Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 by the expected in-service dates of November 2021 and November 2022, respectively, is as follows: (in billions)Base project capital cost forecast(a)(b)$8.0Construction contingency estimate0.4Total project capital cost forecast(a)(b)8.4Net investment as of December 31, 2018(b)(4.6)Remaining estimate to complete(a)$3.8(a)Excludes financing costs expected to be capitalized through AFUDC of approximately $315 million.(b)Net of $1.7 billion received from Toshiba under the Guarantee Settlement Agreement and approximately $188 million in related Customer Refunds.Georgia Power estimates that its financing costs for construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 will total approximately $3.1 billion, of which $1.9 billion had been incurred through December 31, 2018.As construction continues, challenges with management of contractors, subcontractors, and vendors; labor productivity, availability, and/or cost escalation; procurement, fabrication, delivery, assembly, and/or installation and testing, including any required engineering changes, of plant systems, structures, and components (some of which are based on new technology that only recently began initial operation in the global nuclear industry at this scale); or other issues could arise and change the projected schedule and estimated cost. Monthly construction production targets required to maintain the current project schedule will continue to increase significantly throughout 2019. To meet these increasing monthly targets, existing craft construction productivity must improve and additional craft laborers must be retained and deployed.Georgia Power and Southern Nuclear believe it is a leading practice in connection with a construction project of this size and complexity to periodically validate recent construction progress in comparison to the projected schedule and to verify and update quantities of commodities remaining to install, labor productivity, and forecasted staffing needs. This verification process, led by II-106 Table of Contents Index to Financial StatementsMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Georgia Power Company 2018 Annual ReportSouthern Nuclear, was underway as of December 31, 2018 and is expected to be completed during the second quarter 2019. Georgia Power currently does not anticipate any material changes to the total estimated project capital cost forecast for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 or the expected in-service dates of November 2021 and November 2022, respectively, resulting from this verification process. However, the ultimate impact on cost and schedule, if any, will not be known until the verification process is completed. Georgia Power is required to report the results and any project impacts to the Georgia PSC by May 15, 2019.There have been technical and procedural challenges to the construction and licensing of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 at the federal and state level and additional challenges may arise. Processes are in place that are designed to assure compliance with the requirements specified in the Westinghouse Design Control Document and the combined construction and operating licenses, including inspections by Southern Nuclear and the NRC that occur throughout construction. As a result of such compliance processes, certain license amendment requests have been filed and approved or are pending before the NRC. Various design and other licensing-based compliance matters, including the timely resolution of ITAAC and the related approvals by the NRC, may arise, which may result in additional license amendments or require other resolution. If any license amendment requests or other licensing-based compliance issues are not resolved in a timely manner, there may be delays in the project schedule that could result in increased costs.The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time. However, any extension of the project schedule is currently estimated to result in additional base capital costs of approximately $50 million per month, based on Georgia Power's ownership interests, and AFUDC of approximately $12 million per month. While Georgia Power is not precluded from seeking recovery of any future capital cost forecast increase, management will ultimately determine whether or not to seek recovery. Any further changes to the capital cost forecast that are not expected to be recoverable through regulated rates will be required to be charged to income and such charges could be material.Joint Owner ContractsIn November 2017, the Vogtle Owners entered into an amendment to their joint ownership agreements for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 to provide for, among other conditions, additional Vogtle Owner approval requirements. Effective August 31, 2018, the Vogtle Owners further amended the joint ownership agreements to clarify and provide procedures for certain provisions of the joint ownership agreements related to adverse events that require the vote of the holders of at least 90% of the ownership interests in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 to continue construction (as amended, and together with the November 2017 amendment, the Vogtle Joint Ownership Agreements). The Vogtle Joint Ownership Agreements also confirm that the Vogtle Owners' sole recourse against Georgia Power or Southern Nuclear for any action or inaction in connection with their performance as agent for the Vogtle Owners is limited to removal of Georgia Power and/or Southern Nuclear as agent, except in cases of willful misconduct.As a result of the increase in the total project capital cost forecast and Georgia Power's decision not to seek rate recovery of the increase in the base capital costs as described below, the holders of at least 90% of the ownership interests in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 were required to vote to continue construction. On September 26, 2018, the Vogtle Owners unanimously voted to continue construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4.Amendments to the Vogtle Joint Ownership AgreementsIn connection with the vote to continue construction, Georgia Power entered into (i) the Vogtle Owner Term Sheet with the other Vogtle Owners and MEAG's wholly-owned subsidiaries MEAG SPVJ, MEAG Power SPVM, LLC (MEAG SPVM), and MEAG Power SPVP, LLC (MEAG SPVP) to take certain actions which partially mitigate potential financial exposure for the other Vogtle Owners, including additional amendments to the Vogtle Joint Ownership Agreements and the purchase of PTCs from the other Vogtle Owners, and (ii) the MEAG Term Sheet with MEAG and MEAG SPVJ to provide funding with respect to MEAG SPVJ's ownership interest in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 (Project J) under certain circumstances. On January 14, 2019, Georgia Power, MEAG, and MEAG SPVJ entered into an agreement to implement the provisions of the MEAG Term Sheet (MEAG Funding Agreement). On February 18, 2019, Georgia Power, the other Vogtle Owners, and MEAG's wholly-owned subsidiaries MEAG SPVJ, MEAG SPVM, and MEAG SPVP entered into certain amendments to the Vogtle Joint Ownership Agreements to implement the provisions of the Vogtle Owner Term Sheet (Global Amendments).Pursuant to the Global Amendments, and consistent with the Vogtle Owner Term Sheet, the Vogtle Joint Ownership Agreements were modified as follows: (i) each Vogtle Owner must pay its proportionate share of qualifying construction costs for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 based on its ownership percentage up to the estimated cost at completion (EAC) for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 which formed the basis of Georgia Power's forecast of $8.4 billion in the nineteenth VCM plus $800 million; (ii) Georgia Power will be responsible for 55.7% of actual qualifying construction costs between $800 million and $1.6 billion over the EAC in the nineteenth VCM (resulting in $80 million of potential additional costs to Georgia Power), with the remaining Vogtle Owners responsible for 44.3% of such costs pro rata in accordance with their respective ownership interests; and (iii) Georgia Power will be responsible for 65.7% of qualifying construction costs between $1.6 billion and $2.1 billion over the EAC in the nineteenth II-107 Table of Contents Index to Financial StatementsMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Georgia Power Company 2018 Annual ReportVCM (resulting in a further $100 million of potential additional costs to Georgia Power), with the remaining Vogtle Owners responsible for 34.3% of such costs pro rata in accordance with their respective ownership interests.If the EAC is revised and exceeds the EAC in the nineteenth VCM by more than $2.1 billion, each of the other Vogtle Owners will have a one-time option at the time the project budget forecast is so revised to tender a portion of its ownership interest to Georgia Power in exchange for Georgia Power's agreement to pay 100% of such Vogtle Owner's remaining share of total construction costs in excess of the EAC in the nineteenth VCM plus $2.1 billion. In this event, Georgia Power will have the option of cancelling the project in lieu of purchasing a portion of the ownership interest of any other Vogtle Owner. If Georgia Power accepts the offer to purchase a portion of another Vogtle Owner's ownership interest in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, the ownership interest(s) to be conveyed from the tendering Vogtle Owner(s) to Georgia Power will be calculated based on the proportion of the cumulative amount of construction costs paid by each such tendering Vogtle Owner(s) and by Georgia Power as of the COD of Plant Vogtle Unit 4. For purposes of this calculation, payments made by Georgia Power on behalf of another Vogtle Owner in accordance with the second and third items described in the paragraph above will be treated as payments made by the applicable Vogtle Owner.In the event the actual costs of construction at completion of a Unit are less than the EAC reflected in the nineteenth VCM report and such Unit is placed in service in accordance with the schedule projected in the nineteenth VCM report (i.e., Plant Vogtle Unit 3 is placed in service by November 2021 or Plant Vogtle Unit 4 is placed in service by November 2022), Georgia Power will be entitled to 60.7% of the cost savings with respect to the relevant Unit and the remaining Vogtle Owners will be entitled to 39.3% of such savings on a pro rata basis in accordance with their respective ownership interests.For purposes of the foregoing provisions, qualifying construction costs will not include costs (i) resulting from force majeure events, including governmental actions or inactions (or significant delays associated with issuance of such actions) that affect the licensing, completion, start-up, operations, or financing of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, administrative proceedings or litigation regarding ITAAC or other regulatory challenges to commencement of operation of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, and changes in laws or regulations governing Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, (ii) legal fees and legal expenses incurred due to litigation with contractors or subcontractors that are not subsidiaries or affiliates of Southern Company, and (iii) additional costs caused by requests from the Vogtle Owners other than Georgia Power, except for the exercise of a right to vote granted under the Vogtle Joint Ownership Agreements, that increase costs by $100,000 or more.Pursuant to the Global Amendments, and consistent with the Vogtle Owner Term Sheet, the provisions of the Vogtle Joint Ownership Agreements requiring that Vogtle Owners holding 90% of the ownership interests in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 vote to continue construction following certain adverse events (Project Adverse Events) were modified. Pursuant to the Global Amendments, the holders of at least 90% of the ownership interests in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 must vote to continue construction if certain Project Adverse Events occur, including: (i) the bankruptcy of Toshiba; (ii) the termination or rejection in bankruptcy of certain agreements, including the Vogtle Services Agreement, the Bechtel Agreement, or the agency agreement with Southern Nuclear; (iii) Georgia Power publicly announces its intention not to submit for rate recovery any portion of its investment in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 or the Georgia PSC determines that any of Georgia Power's costs relating to the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 will not be recovered in retail rates, excluding any additional amounts paid by Georgia Power on behalf of the other Vogtle Owners pursuant to the Global Amendments described above and the first 6% of costs during any six-month VCM reporting period that are disallowed by the Georgia PSC for recovery, or for which Georgia Power elects not to seek cost recovery, through retail rates; and (iv) an incremental extension of one year or more over the most recently approved schedule. Under the Global Amendments, Georgia Power may cancel the project at any time in its sole discretion.In addition, pursuant to the Vogtle Joint Ownership Agreements, the required approval of holders of ownership interests in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 is at least (i) 90% for a change of the primary construction contractor and (ii) 67% for material amendments to the Vogtle Services Agreement or agreements with Southern Nuclear or the primary construction contractor, including the Bechtel Agreement.The Global Amendments provide that if the holders of at least 90% of the ownership interests fail to vote in favor of continuing the project following any future Project Adverse Event, work on Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 will continue for a period of 30 days if the holders of more than 50% of the ownership interests vote in favor of continuing construction (Majority Voting Owners). In such a case, the Vogtle Owners (i) have agreed to negotiate in good faith towards the resumption of the project, (ii) if no agreement is reached during such 30-day period, the project will be cancelled, and (iii) in the event of such a cancellation, the Majority Voting Owners will be obligated to reimburse any other Vogtle Owner for the incremental costs it incurred during such 30-day negotiation period.II-108 Table of Contents Index to Financial StatementsMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Georgia Power Company 2018 Annual ReportPurchase of PTCs During Commercial OperationPursuant to the Global Amendments, and consistent with the Vogtle Owner Term Sheet, Georgia Power has agreed to purchase additional PTCs from OPC, Dalton, MEAG SPVM, MEAG SPVP, and MEAG SPVJ (to the extent any MEAG SPVJ PTC rights remain after any purchases required under the MEAG Funding Agreement as described below) at varying purchase prices dependent upon the actual cost to complete construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 as compared to the EAC reflected in the nineteenth VCM report. The purchases are at the option of the applicable Vogtle Owner.Potential Funding to MEAG Project JPursuant to the MEAG Funding Agreement, and consistent with the MEAG Term Sheet, if MEAG SPVJ is unable to make its payments due under the Vogtle Joint Ownership Agreements solely as a result of the occurrence of one of the following situations that materially impedes access to capital markets for MEAG for Project J: (i) the conduct of JEA or the City of Jacksonville, such as JEA's legal challenges of its obligations under a PPA with MEAG (PPA-J), or (ii) PPA-J is declared void by a court of competent jurisdiction or rejected by JEA under the applicable provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code (each of (i) and (ii), a JEA Default), at MEAG's request, Georgia Power will purchase from MEAG SPVJ the rights to PTCs attributable to MEAG SPVJ's share of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 (approximately 206 MWs) within 30 days of such request at varying prices dependent upon the stage of construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. The aggregate purchase price of the PTCs, together with any advances made as described in the next paragraph, shall not exceed $300 million.At the option of MEAG, as an alternative or supplement to Georgia Power's purchase of PTCs as described above, Georgia Power has agreed to provide up to $250 million in funding to MEAG for Project J in the form of advances (either advances under the Vogtle Joint Ownership Agreements or the purchase of MEAG Project J bonds, at the discretion of Georgia Power), subject to any required approvals of the Georgia PSC and the DOE.In the event MEAG SPVJ certifies to Georgia Power that it is unable to fund its obligations under the Vogtle Joint Ownership Agreements as a result of a JEA Default and Georgia Power becomes obligated to provide funding as described above, MEAG is required to (i) assign to Georgia Power its right to vote on any future Project Adverse Event and (ii) diligently pursue JEA for its breach of PPA-J. In addition, Georgia Power agreed that it will not sue MEAG for any amounts due from MEAG SPVJ under MEAG's guarantee of MEAG SPVJ's obligations so long as MEAG SPVJ complies with the terms of the MEAG Funding Agreement as to its payment obligations and the other non-payment provisions of the Vogtle Joint Ownership Agreements.Under the terms of the MEAG Funding Agreement, Georgia Power may cancel the project in lieu of providing funding in the form of advances or PTC purchases.The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.Regulatory MattersIn 2009, the Georgia PSC voted to certify construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 with a certified capital cost of $4.418 billion. In addition, in 2009 the Georgia PSC approved inclusion of the Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 related CWIP accounts in rate base, and the State of Georgia enacted the Georgia Nuclear Energy Financing Act, which allows Georgia Power to recover financing costs for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Financing costs are recovered on all applicable certified costs through annual adjustments to the NCCR tariff up to the certified capital cost of $4.418 billion. At December 31, 2018, Georgia Power had recovered approximately $1.9 billion of financing costs. Financing costs related to capital costs above $4.418 billion will be recovered through AFUDC; however, Georgia Power will not record AFUDC related to any capital costs in excess of the total deemed reasonable by the Georgia PSC (currently $7.3 billion) and not requested for rate recovery. On December 18, 2018, the Georgia PSC approved Georgia Power's request to increase the NCCR tariff by $88 million annually, effective January 1, 2019.Georgia Power is required to file semi-annual VCM reports with the Georgia PSC by February 28 and August 31 of each year. In 2013, in connection with the eighth VCM report, the Georgia PSC approved a stipulation between Georgia Power and the staff of the Georgia PSC to waive the requirement to amend the Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 certificate in accordance with the 2009 certification order until the completion of Plant Vogtle Unit 3, or earlier if deemed appropriate by the Georgia PSC and Georgia Power.In 2016, the Georgia PSC voted to approve a settlement agreement (Vogtle Cost Settlement Agreement) resolving certain prudency matters in connection with the fifteenth VCM report. In December 2017, the Georgia PSC voted to approve (and issued its related order on January 11, 2018) Georgia Power's seventeenth VCM report, which included a recommendation to continue construction with Southern Nuclear as project manager and Bechtel serving as the primary construction contractor, and modified the Vogtle Cost Settlement Agreement. The Vogtle Cost Settlement Agreement, as modified by the January 11, 2018 order, resolved the following regulatory matters related to Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4: (i) none of the $3.3 billion of costs incurred II-109 Table of Contents Index to Financial StatementsMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Georgia Power Company 2018 Annual Reportthrough December 31, 2015 and reflected in the fourteenth VCM report should be disallowed from rate base on the basis of imprudence; (ii) the Contractor Settlement Agreement was reasonable and prudent and none of the amounts paid pursuant to the Contractor Settlement Agreement should be disallowed from rate base on the basis of imprudence; (iii) (a) capital costs incurred up to $5.68 billion would be presumed to be reasonable and prudent with the burden of proof on any party challenging such costs, (b) Georgia Power would have the burden to show that any capital costs above $5.68 billion were prudent, and (c) a revised capital cost forecast of $7.3 billion (after reflecting the impact of payments received under the Guarantee Settlement Agreement and related Customer Refunds) was found reasonable; (iv) construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 should be completed, with Southern Nuclear serving as project manager and Bechtel as primary contractor; (v) approved and deemed reasonable Georgia Power's revised schedule placing Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 in service in November 2021 and November 2022, respectively; (vi) confirmed that the revised cost forecast does not represent a cost cap and that prudence decisions on cost recovery will be made at a later date, consistent with applicable Georgia law; (vii) reduced the ROE used to calculate the NCCR tariff (a) from 10.95% (the ROE rate setting point authorized by the Georgia PSC in the 2013 ARP) to 10.00% effective January 1, 2016, (b) from 10.00% to 8.30%, effective January 1, 2020, and (c) from 8.30% to 5.30%, effective January 1, 2021 (provided that the ROE in no case will be less than Georgia Power's average cost of long-term debt); (viii) reduced the ROE used for AFUDC equity for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 from 10.00% to Georgia Power's average cost of long-term debt, effective January 1, 2018; and (ix) agreed that upon Unit 3 reaching commercial operation, retail base rates would be adjusted to include carrying costs on those capital costs deemed prudent in the Vogtle Cost Settlement Agreement. The January 11, 2018 order also stated that if Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 are not commercially operational by June 1, 2021 and June 1, 2022, respectively, the ROE used to calculate the NCCR tariff will be further reduced by 10 basis points each month (but not lower than Georgia Power's average cost of long-term debt) until the respective Unit is commercially operational. The ROE reductions negatively impacted earnings by approximately $100 million, $25 million, and $20 million in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively, and are estimated to have negative earnings impacts of approximately $75 million in 2019 and an aggregate of approximately $615 million from 2020 to 2022.In its January 11, 2018 order, the Georgia PSC also stated if other conditions change and assumptions upon which Georgia Power's seventeenth VCM report are based do not materialize, the Georgia PSC reserved the right to reconsider the decision to continue construction.On February 12, 2018, Georgia Interfaith Power & Light, Inc. (GIPL) and Partnership for Southern Equity, Inc. (PSE) filed a petition appealing the Georgia PSC's January 11, 2018 order with the Fulton County Superior Court. On March 8, 2018, Georgia Watch filed a similar appeal to the Fulton County Superior Court for judicial review of the Georgia PSC's decision and denial of Georgia Watch's motion for reconsideration. On December 21, 2018, the Fulton County Superior Court granted Georgia Power's motion to dismiss the two appeals. On January 9, 2019, GIPL, PSE, and Georgia Watch filed an appeal of this decision with the Georgia Court of Appeals. Georgia Power believes the appeal has no merit; however, an adverse outcome in the appeal combined with subsequent adverse action by the Georgia PSC could have a material impact on Georgia Power's results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.In preparation for its nineteenth VCM filing, Georgia Power requested Southern Nuclear to perform a full cost reforecast for the project. This reforecast, performed prior to the nineteenth VCM filing, resulted in a $0.7 billion increase to the base capital cost forecast reported in the second quarter 2018. This base cost increase primarily resulted from changed assumptions related to the finalization of contract scopes and management responsibilities for Bechtel and over 60 subcontractors, labor productivity rates, and craft labor incentives, as well as the related levels of project management, oversight, and support, including field supervision and engineering support.Although Georgia Power believes these incremental costs are reasonable and necessary to complete the project and the Georgia PSC's order in the seventeenth VCM proceeding specifically states that the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 is not subject to a cost cap, Georgia Power did not seek rate recovery for these cost increases included in the current base capital cost forecast (or any related financing costs) in the nineteenth VCM report. In connection with future VCM filings, Georgia Power may request the Georgia PSC to evaluate costs currently included in the construction contingency estimate for rate recovery as and when they are appropriately included in the base capital cost forecast. After considering the significant level of uncertainty that exists regarding the future recoverability of costs included in the construction contingency estimate since the ultimate outcome of these matters is subject to the outcome of future assessments by management, as well as Georgia PSC decisions in these future regulatory proceedings, Georgia Power recorded a total pre-tax charge to income of $1.1 billion ($0.8 billion after tax) in the second quarter 2018, which includes the total increase in the base capital cost forecast and construction contingency estimate.On August 31, 2018, Georgia Power filed its nineteenth VCM report with the Georgia PSC, which requested approval of $578 million of construction capital costs incurred from January 1, 2018 through June 30, 2018. On February 19, 2019, the Georgia PSC approved the nineteenth VCM, but deferred approval of $51.6 million of expenditures related to Georgia Power's portion of II-110 Table of Contents Index to Financial StatementsMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Georgia Power Company 2018 Annual Reportan administrative claim filed in the Westinghouse bankruptcy proceedings. Through the nineteenth VCM, the Georgia PSC has approved total construction capital costs incurred through June 30, 2018 of $5.4 billion (before $1.7 billion of payments received under the Guarantee Settlement Agreement and approximately $188 million in related Customer Refunds). In addition, the staff of the Georgia PSC requested, and Georgia Power agreed, to file its twentieth VCM report concurrently with the twenty-first VCM report by August 31, 2019.The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.DOE FinancingAt December 31, 2018, Georgia Power had borrowed $2.6 billion related to Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 costs through the Loan Guarantee Agreement and a multi-advance credit facility among Georgia Power, the DOE, and the FFB, which provides for borrowings of up to $3.46 billion, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. In September 2017, the DOE issued a conditional commitment to Georgia Power for up to approximately $1.67 billion in additional guaranteed loans under the Loan Guarantee Agreement. In September 2018, the DOE extended the conditional commitment to March 31, 2019. Any further extension must be approved by the DOE. Final approval and issuance of these additional loan guarantees by the DOE cannot be assured and are subject to the negotiation of definitive agreements, completion of due diligence by the DOE, receipt of any necessary regulatory approvals, and satisfaction of other conditions. See Note 8 to the financial statements under ""Long-term Debt – DOE Loan Guarantee Borrowings"" for additional information, including applicable covenants, events of default, mandatory prepayment events (including any decision not to continue construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4), and conditions to borrowing.The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.Income Tax MattersFederal Tax Reform LegislationIn December 2017, the Tax Reform Legislation was signed into law and became effective on January 1, 2018. The Tax Reform Legislation, among other things, reduced the federal corporate income tax rate to 21%, retained normalization provisions for public utility property and existing renewable energy incentives, and repealed the corporate alternative minimum tax. In addition, under the Tax Reform Legislation, net operating losses generated after December 31, 2017 can no longer be carried back to previous tax years but can be carried forward indefinitely, with utilization limited to 80% of taxable income of the subsequent tax year. The projected reduction of Southern Company's consolidated income tax liability resulting from the tax rate reduction also delays the expected utilization of existing tax credit carryforwards at Georgia Power. See Note 10 to the financial statements for information on Southern Company's joint consolidated income tax allocation agreement.Following the enactment of the Tax Reform Legislation, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin 118 – ""Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act"" (SAB 118), which provided for a measurement period of up to one year from the enactment date to complete accounting under GAAP for the tax effects of the legislation. Due to the complex and comprehensive nature of the enacted tax law changes and their application under GAAP, Georgia Power considered all amounts recorded in the financial statements as a result of the Tax Reform Legislation ""provisional"" as discussed in SAB 118 and subject to revision prior to filing its 2017 tax return in the fourth quarter 2018. Georgia Power recognized tax benefits of $50 million and $8 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively, for a total of $58 million as a result of the Tax Reform Legislation. In addition, in total, Georgia Power recorded a $147 million decrease in regulatory assets and a $3.0 billion increase in regulatory liabilities as a result of the Tax Reform Legislation and $2 million of stranded excess deferred tax balances in AOCI at December 31, 2017 were adjusted through retained earnings in 2018. As of December 31, 2018, Georgia Power considered the measurement of impacts from the Tax Reform Legislation on deferred income tax assets and liabilities, primarily due to the impact of the reduction of the corporate income tax rate, to be complete.However, the IRS continues to issue regulations that provide further interpretation and guidance on the law and each state's adoption of the provisions contained in the Tax Reform Legislation remains uncertain. The ultimate impact of this matter cannot be determined at this time. See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Georgia Power – Rate Plans"" for additional information regarding the Georgia Power Tax Reform Settlement Agreement. The regulatory treatment of certain impacts of the Tax Reform Legislation remains subject to the discretion of the Georgia PSC in the Georgia Power 2019 Base Rate Case and the FERC. Also, see FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY – ""Credit Rating Risk"" herein and Note 10 to the financial statements under ""Current and Deferred Income Taxes"" for additional information.II-111 Table of Contents Index to Financial StatementsMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Georgia Power Company 2018 Annual ReportBonus DepreciationUnder the Tax Reform Legislation, projects with binding contracts prior to September 28, 2017 and placed in service after September 27, 2017 remain eligible for bonus depreciation under the PATH Act. The PATH Act allowed for 50% bonus depreciation for 2015 through 2017, 40% bonus depreciation for 2018, and 30% bonus depreciation for 2019 and certain long-lived assets placed in service in 2020. Based on provisional estimates, bonus depreciation is expected to result in positive cash flows of approximately $80 million for the 2018 tax year and approximately $30 million for the 2019 tax year. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.Other MattersGeorgia Power is involved in various other matters being litigated and regulatory matters that could affect future earnings. In addition, Georgia Power is subject to certain claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. Georgia Power's business activities are subject to extensive governmental regulation related to public health and the environment, such as laws and regulations governing air, water, land, and protection of other natural resources. Litigation over environmental issues and claims of various types, including property damage, personal injury, common law nuisance, and citizen enforcement of environmental laws and regulations, has occurred throughout the U.S. This litigation has included claims for damages alleged to have been caused by CO2 and other emissions, CCR, and alleged exposure to hazardous materials, and/or requests for injunctive relief in connection with such matters.The ultimate outcome of such pending or potential litigation or regulatory matters cannot be predicted at this time; however, for current proceedings not specifically reported herein or in Notes 2 and 3 to the financial statements, management does not anticipate that the ultimate liabilities, if any, arising from such current proceedings would have a material effect on Georgia Power's financial statements. See Notes 2 and 3 to the financial statements for a discussion of various other contingencies, regulatory matters, and other matters being litigated which may affect future earnings potential.ACCOUNTING POLICIESApplication of Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesGeorgia Power prepares its financial statements in accordance with GAAP. Significant accounting policies are described in Notes 1, 5, and 6 to the financial statements. In the application of these policies, certain estimates are made that may have a material impact on Georgia Power's results of operations and related disclosures. Different assumptions and measurements could produce estimates that are significantly different from those recorded in the financial statements. Senior management has reviewed and discussed the following critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of Southern Company's Board of Directors.Utility RegulationGeorgia Power is subject to retail regulation by the Georgia PSC and wholesale regulation by the FERC. These regulatory agencies set the rates Georgia Power is permitted to charge customers based on allowable costs. As a result, Georgia Power applies accounting standards which require the financial statements to reflect the effects of rate regulation. Through the ratemaking process, the regulators may require the inclusion of costs or revenues in periods different than when they would be recognized by a non-regulated company. This treatment may result in the deferral of expenses and the recording of related regulatory assets based on anticipated future recovery through rates or the deferral of gains or creation of liabilities and the recording of related regulatory liabilities. The application of the accounting standards has a further effect on Georgia Power's financial statements as a result of the estimates of allowable costs used in the ratemaking process. These estimates may differ from those actually incurred by Georgia Power; therefore, the accounting estimates inherent in specific costs such as depreciation, AROs, and pension and other postretirement benefits have less of a direct impact on Georgia Power's results of operations and financial condition than they would on a non-regulated company.As reflected in Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Georgia Power – Regulatory Assets and Liabilities,"" significant regulatory assets and liabilities have been recorded. Management reviews the ultimate recoverability of these regulatory assets and any requirement to refund these regulatory liabilities based on applicable regulatory guidelines and GAAP. However, adverse legislative, judicial, or regulatory actions could materially impact the amounts of such regulatory assets and liabilities and could adversely impact Georgia Power's financial statements.Estimated Cost, Schedule, and Rate Recovery for the Construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4In 2016, the Georgia PSC approved the Vogtle Cost Settlement Agreement, which resolved certain prudency matters in connection with Georgia Power's fifteenth VCM report. In December 2017, the Georgia PSC approved Georgia Power's seventeenth VCM II-112 Table of Contents Index to Financial StatementsMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Georgia Power Company 2018 Annual Reportreport, which included a recommendation to continue construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, with Southern Nuclear serving as project manager and Bechtel serving as the primary construction contractor, as well as a modification of the Vogtle Cost Settlement Agreement. The Georgia PSC's related order stated that under the modified Vogtle Cost Settlement Agreement, (i) none of the $3.3 billion of costs incurred through December 31, 2015 should be disallowed as imprudent; (ii) capital costs incurred up to $5.68 billion would be presumed to be reasonable and prudent with the burden of proof on any party challenging such costs; (iii) Georgia Power would have the burden of proof to show that any capital costs above $5.68 billion were prudent; (iv) Georgia Power's total project capital cost forecast of $7.3 billion (net of $1.7 billion received under the Guarantee Settlement Agreement and approximately $188 million in related Customer Refunds) was found reasonable and did not represent a cost cap; and (v) prudence decisions would be made subsequent to achieving fuel load for Unit 4.In its order, the Georgia PSC also stated if other conditions change and assumptions upon which Georgia Power's seventeenth VCM report are based do not materialize, the Georgia PSC reserved the right to reconsider the decision to continue construction.In the second quarter 2018, Georgia Power revised its base cost forecast and estimated contingency to complete construction and start-up of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 to $8.0 billion and $0.4 billion, respectively, for a total project capital cost forecast of $8.4 billion (net of $1.7 billion received under the Guarantee Settlement Agreement and approximately $188 million in related Customer Refunds). Although Georgia Power believes these incremental costs are reasonable and necessary to complete the project and the Georgia PSC's order in the seventeenth VCM proceeding specifically states that the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 is not subject to a cost cap, Georgia Power did not seek rate recovery for the $0.7 billion increase in costs included in the current base capital cost forecast in the nineteenth VCM report. In connection with future VCM filings, Georgia Power may request the Georgia PSC to evaluate costs currently included in the construction contingency estimate for rate recovery as and when they are appropriately included in the base capital cost forecast. After considering the significant level of uncertainty that exists regarding the future recoverability of costs included in the construction contingency estimate since the ultimate outcome of these matters is subject to the outcome of future assessments by management, as well as Georgia PSC decisions in these future regulatory proceedings, Georgia Power recorded a total pre-tax charge to income of $1.1 billion ($0.8 billion after tax) in the second quarter 2018.Georgia Power's revised cost estimate reflects an expected in-service date of November 2021 for Unit 3 and November 2022 for Unit 4.As construction continues, challenges with management of contractors, subcontractors, and vendors; labor productivity, availability, and/or cost escalation; procurement, fabrication, delivery, assembly, and/or installation and testing, including any required engineering changes, of plant systems, structures, and components (some of which are based on new technology that only recently began initial operation in the global nuclear industry at this scale); or other issues could arise and change the projected schedule and estimated cost. Monthly construction production targets required to maintain the current project schedule will continue to increase significantly throughout 2019. To meet these increasing monthly targets, existing craft construction productivity must improve and additional craft laborers must be retained and deployed.Georgia Power and Southern Nuclear believe it is a leading practice in connection with a construction project of this size and complexity to periodically validate recent construction progress in comparison to the projected schedule and to verify and update quantities of commodities remaining to install, labor productivity, and forecasted staffing needs. This verification process, led by Southern Nuclear, was underway as of December 31, 2018 and is expected to be completed during the second quarter 2019. Georgia Power currently does not anticipate any material changes to the total estimated project capital cost forecast for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 or the expected in-service dates of November 2021 and November 2022, respectively, resulting from this verification process. However, the ultimate impact on cost and schedule, if any, will not be known until the verification process is completed. Georgia Power is required to report the results and any project impacts to the Georgia PSC by May 15, 2019.There have been technical and procedural challenges to the construction and licensing of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 at the federal and state level and additional challenges may arise. Processes are in place that are designed to assure compliance with the requirements specified in the Westinghouse Design Control Document and the combined construction and operating licenses, including inspections by Southern Nuclear and the NRC that occur throughout construction. As a result of such compliance processes, certain license amendment requests have been filed and approved or are pending before the NRC. Various design and other licensing-based compliance matters, including the timely resolution of ITAAC and the related approvals by the NRC, may arise, which may result in additional license amendments or require other resolution. If any license amendment requests or other licensing-based compliance issues are not resolved in a timely manner, there may be delays in the project schedule that could result in increased costs.The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time. Any extension of the in-service dates of November 2021 for Unit 3 and November 2022 for Unit 4 is currently estimated to result in additional base capital costs of approximately $50 million per month, based on Georgia Power's ownership interests, and AFUDC of approximately $12 million per month. While II-113 Table of Contents Index to Financial StatementsMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Georgia Power Company 2018 Annual ReportGeorgia Power is not precluded from seeking recovery of any future capital cost forecast increase, management will ultimately determine whether or not to seek recovery. Any further changes to the capital cost forecast that are not expected to be recoverable through regulated rates will be required to be charged to income and such charges could be material.Given the significant complexity involved in estimating the future costs to complete construction and start-up of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 and the significant management judgment necessary to assess the related uncertainties surrounding future rate recovery of any projected cost increases, as well as the potential impact on Georgia Power's results of operations and cash flows, Georgia Power considers these items to be critical accounting estimates. See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Georgia Power – Nuclear Construction"" for additional information.Asset Retirement ObligationsAROs are computed as the fair value of the estimated costs for an asset's future retirement and are recorded in the period in which the liability is incurred. The estimated costs are capitalized as part of the related long-lived asset and depreciated over the asset's useful life. In the absence of quoted market prices, AROs are estimated using present value techniques in which estimates of future cash outlays associated with the asset retirements are discounted using a credit-adjusted risk-free rate. Estimates of the timing and amounts of future cash outlays are based on projections of when and how the assets will be retired and the cost of future removal activities.The liability for AROs primarily relates to the decommissioning of Georgia Power's nuclear facilities, which include Georgia Power's ownership interests in Plant Hatch and Plant Vogtle Units 1 and 2, and facilities that are subject to the CCR Rule and the related state rule, principally ash ponds. In addition, Georgia Power has AROs related to various landfill sites, underground storage tanks, and asbestos removal.Georgia Power also has identified retirement obligations related to certain transmission and distribution facilities, including the disposal of polychlorinated biphenyls in certain transformers; leasehold improvements; equipment on customer property; and property associated with Georgia Power's rail lines and natural gas pipelines. However, liabilities for the removal of these assets have not been recorded because the settlement timing for the retirement obligations related to these assets is indeterminable and, therefore, the fair value of the retirement obligations cannot be reasonably estimated. A liability for these retirement obligations will be recognized when sufficient information becomes available to support a reasonable estimation of the retirement obligation.Georgia Power previously recorded AROs as a result of state requirements in Georgia which closely align with the requirements of the CCR Rule discussed above. The cost estimates for AROs related to the disposal of CCR are based on information using various assumptions related to closure and post-closure costs, timing of future cash outlays, inflation and discount rates, and the potential methods for complying with the CCR Rule and the related state rule. In December 2018, Georgia Power recorded an increase of approximately $3.1 billion to its AROs related to the disposal of CCR as a result of a strategic assessment which indicated additional closure costs will be required to close the ash ponds, primarily due to changes in closure strategies, the estimated amount of ash to be excavated, and additional water management requirements necessary to support closure strategies. Also in December 2018, Georgia Power recorded an increase of approximately $130 million to its AROs as a result of updated decommissioning cost site studies for Plant Hatch and Plant Vogtle Units 1 and 2. Georgia Power expects to periodically update its ARO cost estimates. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – ""Environmental Matters – Environmental Laws and Regulations – Coal Combustion Residuals"" herein and Note 6 to the financial statements for additional information.Given the significant judgment involved in estimating AROs, Georgia Power considers the liabilities for AROs to be critical accounting estimates.Pension and Other Postretirement BenefitsGeorgia Power's calculation of pension and other postretirement benefits expense is dependent on a number of assumptions. These assumptions include discount rates, healthcare cost trend rates, expected long-term return on plan assets, mortality rates, expected salary and wage increases, and other factors. Components of pension and other postretirement benefits expense include interest and service cost on the pension and other postretirement benefit plans, expected return on plan assets, and amortization of certain unrecognized costs and obligations. Actual results that differ from the assumptions utilized are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, generally affect recognized expense and the recorded obligation in future periods. While Georgia Power believes that the assumptions used are appropriate, differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions would affect its pension and other postretirement benefit costs and obligations.Key elements in determining Georgia Power's pension and other postretirement benefit expense are the expected long-term return on plan assets and the discount rate used to measure the benefit plan obligations and the periodic benefit plan expense for future periods. The expected long-term return on pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets is based on Southern Company's investment strategy, historical experience, and expectations for long-term rates of return that consider external actuarial advice. II-114 Table of Contents Index to Financial StatementsMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Georgia Power Company 2018 Annual ReportSouthern Company determines the long-term return on plan assets by applying the long-term rate of expected returns on various asset classes to Southern Company's target asset allocation. For purposes of determining Georgia Power's liability related to the pension and other postretirement benefit plans, Southern Company discounts the future related cash flows using a single-point discount rate for each plan developed from the weighted average of market-observed yields for high quality fixed income securities with maturities that correspond to expected benefit payments.A 25 basis point change in any significant assumption (discount rate, salary increases, or long-term rate of return on plan assets) would result in a $10 million or less change in total annual benefit expense, a $128 million or less change in the projected obligation for the pension plan, and an $18 million or less change in the projected obligation for other postretirement benefit plans.See Note 11 to the financial statements for additional information regarding pension and other postretirement benefits.Contingent ObligationsGeorgia Power is subject to a number of federal and state laws and regulations, as well as other factors and conditions that subject it to environmental, litigation, and other risks. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL herein and Notes 2 and 3 to the financial statements for more information regarding certain of these contingencies. Georgia Power periodically evaluates its exposure to such risks and records reserves for those matters where a non-tax-related loss is considered probable and reasonably estimable. The adequacy of reserves can be significantly affected by external events or conditions that can be unpredictable; thus, the ultimate outcome of such matters could materially affect Georgia Power's results of operations, cash flows, or financial condition.Recently Issued Accounting StandardsSee Note 1 to the financial statements under ""Recently Adopted Accounting Standards"" for additional information.In 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) (ASU 2016-02). ASU 2016-02 requires lessees to recognize on the balance sheet a lease liability and a right-of-use asset for all leases. ASU 2016-02 also changes the recognition, measurement, and presentation of expense associated with leases and provides clarification regarding the identification of certain components of contracts that would represent a lease. The accounting required by lessors is relatively unchanged. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 and Georgia Power adopted the new standard effective January 1, 2019.Georgia Power elected the transition methodology provided by ASU No. 2018-11, Leases (Topic 842): Targeted Improvements, whereby the requirements of ASU 2016-02 are applied on a prospective basis as of the adoption date of January 1, 2019, without restating prior periods. Georgia Power elected the package of practical expedients provided by ASU 2016-02 that allows prior determinations of whether existing contracts are, or contain, leases and the classification of existing leases to continue without reassessment. Additionally, Georgia Power applied the use-of-hindsight practical expedient in determining lease terms as of the date of adoption and elected the practical expedient that allows existing land easements not previously accounted for as leases not to be reassessed. Georgia Power also made accounting policy elections to account for short-term leases in all asset classes as off-balance sheet leases and combined lease and non-lease components in the computations of lease obligations and right-of-use assets for most asset classes.Georgia Power completed the implementation of a new application to track and account for its leases and updated its internal controls and accounting policies to support the accounting for leases under ASU 2016-02. Georgia Power completed its lease inventory and determined its most significant leases involve PPAs and real estate. In the first quarter 2019, the adoption of ASU 2016-02 resulted in recording lease liabilities and right-of-use assets on Georgia Power's balance sheet each totaling approximately $1.5 billion, with no impact on Georgia Power's statement of income.FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITYOverviewGeorgia Power's financial condition remained stable at December 31, 2018. Georgia Power's cash requirements primarily consist of funding ongoing operations, common stock dividends, capital expenditures, and debt maturities. Capital expenditures and other investing activities include investments to build new generation facilities, including Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, to maintain existing generation facilities, to comply with environmental regulations including adding environmental modifications to existing generating units and closures of ash ponds, to expand and improve transmission and distribution facilities, and for restoration following major storms. Operating cash flows provide a substantial portion of Georgia Power's cash needs. For the three-year period from 2019 through 2021, Georgia Power's projected common stock dividends, capital expenditures, and debt maturities are expected to exceed operating cash flows. Georgia Power plans to finance future cash needs in excess of its operating cash flows primarily through external securities issuances, equity contributions from Southern Company, borrowings from financial II-115 Table of Contents Index to Financial StatementsMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Georgia Power Company 2018 Annual Reportinstitutions, and borrowings through the FFB. Georgia Power plans to use commercial paper to manage seasonal variations in operating cash flows and for other working capital needs. Georgia Power intends to continue to monitor its access to short-term and long-term capital markets as well as bank credit arrangements to meet future capital and liquidity needs. See ""Sources of Capital,"" ""Financing Activities,"" and ""Capital Requirements and Contractual Obligations"" herein for additional information.Georgia Power's investments in the qualified pension plan and nuclear decommissioning trust funds decreased in value as of December 31, 2018 as compared to December 31, 2017. No contributions to the qualified pension plan were made for the year ended December 31, 2018 and no mandatory contributions to the qualified pension plan are anticipated during 2019. Georgia Power also funded approximately $5 million to its nuclear decommissioning trust funds in 2018. See ""Contractual Obligations"" herein and Notes 6 and 11 to the financial statements under ""Nuclear Decommissioning"" and ""Pension Plans,"" respectively, for additional information.Net cash provided from operating activities totaled $2.8 billion in 2018, an increase of $857 million from 2017, primarily due to the timing of vendor and property tax payments and income tax refunds, a decrease in current income taxes related to the Tax Reform Legislation, increased fuel cost recovery, and the timing of fossil fuel stock purchases, partially offset by payments of customer refunds primarily related to the Guarantee Settlement Agreement and the Georgia Power Tax Reform Settlement Agreement. Net cash provided from operating activities totaled $1.9 billion in 2017, a decrease of $513 million from 2016, primarily due to the timing of vendor payments and increases in under-recovered fuel costs and prepaid federal income taxes, partially offset by a decrease in voluntary contributions to the qualified pension plan. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – ""Income Tax Matters – Federal Tax Reform Legislation"" herein and Note 10 to the financial statements for additional information regarding federal income taxes.Net cash used for investing activities totaled $3.1 billion, $0.9 billion, and $2.3 billion in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively, due to gross property additions primarily related to installation of equipment to comply with environmental standards and construction of generation, transmission, and distribution facilities, including a total of $2.7 billion related to the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, partially offset in 2017 by $1.7 billion in payments received under the Guarantee Settlement Agreement. The majority of funds needed for gross property additions for the last several years has been provided from operating activities, capital contributions from Southern Company, and the issuance of debt. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – ""Retail Regulatory Matters – Nuclear Construction"" herein for additional information on the Guarantee Settlement Agreement and construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4.Net cash used for financing activities totaled $400 million, $151 million, and $142 million for 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. The increase in cash used in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily due to lower issuances of senior notes and short-term bank debt and higher redemptions and repurchases of senior notes, partially offset by higher capital contributions from Southern Company and an increase in notes payable. The increase in cash used in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to a decrease in notes payable, a decrease in borrowings from the FFB for construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, and the redemption of all outstanding shares of Georgia Power's preferred and preference stock, partially offset by higher issuances of senior notes and junior subordinated notes and a decrease in maturities of senior notes. Fluctuations in cash flow from financing activities vary from year to year based on capital needs and the maturity or redemption of securities.Significant balance sheet changes in 2018 included an increase in property, plant, and equipment of $2.6 billion primarily related to the $3.2 billion increase in AROs, as well as the installation of equipment to comply with environmental standards and the construction of generation, transmission, and distribution facilities, and net of the $1.1 billion charge related to the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4; an increase of $2.0 billion in other regulatory assets, deferred primarily related to AROs; and a decrease of $1.9 billion in long-term debt (including securities due within one year) primarily due to the redemption, repurchase, and maturity of senior notes and the purchase of pollution control revenue bonds. Total common stockholder's equity increased $2.4 billion primarily due to a $3.0 billion increase in paid-in capital resulting from capital contributions received from Southern Company, partially offset by a $0.6 billion decrease in retained earnings primarily due to the charge related to Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. See Note 6 to the financial statements for additional information on AROs and Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Georgia Power – Nuclear Construction"" for additional information regarding Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4.Georgia Power's ratio of common equity to total capitalization plus short-term debt was 58.2% at December 31, 2018 and 49.7% at December 31, 2017. See Note 8 to the financial statements for additional information.Sources of CapitalGeorgia Power plans to obtain the funds required for construction and other purposes from sources similar to those used in the past, which were primarily from operating cash flows, external security issuances, borrowings from financial institutions, equity contributions from Southern Company, and borrowings from the FFB. However, the amount, type, and timing of any future financings, if needed, will depend upon regulatory approvals, prevailing market conditions, and other factors.II-116 Table of Contents Index to Financial StatementsMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Georgia Power Company 2018 Annual ReportIn 2014, Georgia Power entered into the Loan Guarantee Agreement with the DOE, under which the proceeds of borrowings may be used to reimburse Georgia Power for Eligible Project Costs incurred in connection with its construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Under the Loan Guarantee Agreement, the DOE agreed to guarantee borrowings of up to $3.46 billion (not to exceed 70% of Eligible Project Costs) to be made by Georgia Power under a multi-advance credit facility (FFB Credit Facility) among Georgia Power, the DOE, and the FFB. At December 31, 2018, Georgia Power had borrowed $2.6 billion under the FFB Credit Facility. In July 2017, Georgia Power entered into an amendment to the Loan Guarantee Agreement, which provides that further advances are conditioned upon the DOE's approval of any agreements entered into in replacement of the Vogtle 3 and 4 Agreement and satisfaction of certain other conditions.In September 2017, the DOE issued a conditional commitment to Georgia Power for up to approximately $1.67 billion of additional guaranteed loans under the Loan Guarantee Agreement. This conditional commitment expires on March 31, 2019, subject to any further extension approved by the DOE. Final approval and issuance of these additional loan guarantees by the DOE cannot be assured and are subject to the negotiation of definitive agreements, completion of due diligence by the DOE, receipt of any necessary regulatory approvals, and satisfaction of other conditions. See Note 8 to the financial statements under ""Long-term Debt – DOE Loan Guarantee Borrowings"" for additional information regarding the Loan Guarantee Agreement, including applicable covenants, events of default, mandatory prepayment events (including any decision not to continue construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4), and additional conditions to borrowing. Also see Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Georgia Power – Nuclear Construction"" for additional information regarding Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4.The issuance of long-term securities by Georgia Power is subject to the approval of the Georgia PSC. In addition, the issuance of short-term debt securities by Georgia Power is subject to regulatory approval by the FERC. Additionally, with respect to the public offering of securities, Georgia Power files registration statements with the SEC under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The amounts of securities authorized by the Georgia PSC and the FERC are continuously monitored and appropriate filings are made to ensure flexibility in the capital markets.Georgia Power obtains financing separately without credit support from any affiliate. See Note 8 to the financial statements under ""Bank Credit Arrangements"" for additional information. The Southern Company system does not maintain a centralized cash or money pool. Therefore, funds of Georgia Power are not commingled with funds of any other company in the Southern Company system.At December 31, 2018, Georgia Power's current liabilities exceeded current assets by $1.4 billion primarily as a result of $0.6 billion of long-term debt that is due within one year and $0.3 billion of notes payable. Georgia Power's current liabilities frequently exceed current assets because of scheduled maturities of long-term debt and the periodic use of short-term debt as a funding source, as well as significant seasonal fluctuations in cash needs.At December 31, 2018, Georgia Power had approximately $4 million of cash and cash equivalents. Georgia Power's committed credit arrangement with banks was $1.75 billion at December 31, 2018, of which $1.74 billion was unused. This credit arrangement expires in 2022.This bank credit arrangement contains a covenant that limits debt levels and contains a cross-acceleration provision to other indebtedness (including guarantee obligations) of Georgia Power. Such cross-acceleration provision to other indebtedness would trigger an event of default if Georgia Power defaulted on indebtedness, the payment of which was then accelerated. At December 31, 2018, Georgia Power was in compliance with this covenant. This bank credit arrangement does not contain a material adverse change clause at the time of borrowing.Subject to applicable market conditions, Georgia Power expects to renew or replace this credit arrangement as needed prior to expiration. In connection therewith, Georgia Power may extend the maturity date and/or increase or decrease the lending commitments thereunder.See Note 8 to the financial statements under ""Bank Credit Arrangements"" for additional information.A portion of the $1.74 billion unused credit with banks is allocated to provide liquidity support to Georgia Power's pollution control revenue bonds and commercial paper program. The amount of variable rate pollution control revenue bonds outstanding requiring liquidity support at December 31, 2018 was $659 million as compared to $550 million at December 31, 2017. In addition, at December 31, 2018, Georgia Power had obligations related to $345 million of pollution control revenue bonds outstanding that are required to be remarketed within the next 12 months. Subsequent to December 31, 2018, Georgia Power redeemed approximately $108 million of these obligations.Georgia Power may also meet short-term cash needs through a Southern Company subsidiary organized to issue and sell commercial paper at the request and for the benefit of Georgia Power and the other traditional electric operating companies. Proceeds from such issuances for the benefit of Georgia Power are loaned directly to Georgia Power. The obligations of each II-117 Table of Contents Index to Financial StatementsMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Georgia Power Company 2018 Annual Reporttraditional electric operating company under these arrangements are several and there is no cross-affiliate credit support. Short-term borrowings are included in notes payable in the balance sheets.Details of short-term borrowings were as follows:Short-term Debt at the End of the PeriodShort-term Debt During the Period (*)Amount OutstandingWeighted Average Interest RateAverage Amount OutstandingWeighted Average Interest RateMaximum Amount Outstanding(in millions)(in millions)(in millions)December 31, 2018:Commercial paper$2943.1%$1272.5%$710Short-term bank debt——%122.3%150Total$2943.1%$1392.5%December 31, 2017:Commercial paper$——%$1351.3%$760Short-term bank debt1502.2%2922.0%800Total$1502.2%$4271.8%December 31, 2016:Commercial paper$3921.1%$870.8%$443(*)Average and maximum amounts are based upon daily balances during the 12-month periods ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016.Georgia Power believes the need for working capital can be adequately met by utilizing the commercial paper program, lines of credit, short-term bank notes, and operating cash flows.Financing ActivitiesIn addition to any financings that may be necessary to meet capital requirements and contractual obligations, Georgia Power plans to continue, when economically feasible, a program to retire higher-cost securities and replace these obligations with lower-cost capital if market conditions permit.Senior NotesIn April 2018, Georgia Power redeemed all $250 million aggregate principal amount of its Series 2008B 5.40% Senior Notes due June 1, 2018.In May 2018, through cash tender offers, Georgia Power repurchased and retired $89 million of the $250 million aggregate principal amount outstanding of its Series 2007A 5.65% Senior Notes due March 1, 2037, $326 million of the $500 million aggregate principal amount outstanding of its Series 2009A 5.95% Senior Notes due February 1, 2039, and $335 million of the $600 million aggregate principal amount outstanding of its Series 2010B 5.40% Senior Notes due June 1, 2040, for an aggregate purchase price, excluding accrued and unpaid interest, of $902 million.In December 2018, Georgia Power repaid at maturity $500 million aggregate principal amount of its Series 2015A 1.95% Senior Notes.Pollution Control Revenue BondsDuring 2018, Georgia Power purchased and held the following pollution control revenue bonds, which may be reoffered to the public at a later date:•approximately $105 million aggregate principal amount of Development Authority of Burke County (Georgia) Pollution Control Revenue Bonds (Georgia Power Company Plant Vogtle Project), First Series 2013•$173 million aggregate principal amount of Development Authority of Bartow County (Georgia) Pollution Control Revenue Bonds (Georgia Power Company Plant Bowen Project), First Series 2009•$55 million aggregate principal amount of Development Authority of Burke County (Georgia) Pollution Control Revenue Bonds (Georgia Power Company Plant Vogtle Project), Fifth Series 1994II-118 Table of Contents Index to Financial StatementsMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Georgia Power Company 2018 Annual Report•$65 million aggregate principal amount of Development Authority of Burke County (Georgia) Pollution Control Revenue Bonds (Georgia Power Company Plant Vogtle Project), Second Series 2008•approximately $72 million aggregate principal amount of Development Authority of Bartow County (Georgia) Pollution Control Revenue Bonds (Georgia Power Company Plant Bowen Project), First Series 2013In December 2018, the Development Authority of Burke County (Georgia) issued approximately $108 million aggregate principal amount of Pollution Control Revenue Bonds (Georgia Power Company Plant Vogtle Project), First Series 2018 due November 1, 2052 for the benefit of Georgia Power. The proceeds were used to redeem, in January 2019, approximately $13 million, $20 million, and $75 million aggregate principal amount of Development Authority of Burke County (Georgia) Pollution Control Revenue Bonds (Georgia Power Company Plant Vogtle Project), First Series 1992, Eighth Series 1994, and Second Series 1995, respectively.OtherIn January 2018, Georgia Power repaid its outstanding $150 million and $100 million floating rate bank loans due May 31, 2018 and October 26, 2018, respectively.Credit Rating RiskAt December 31, 2018, Georgia Power did not have any credit arrangements that would require material changes in payment schedules or terminations as a result of a credit rating downgrade.There are certain contracts that could require collateral, but not accelerated payment, in the event of a credit rating change to BBB- and/or Baa3 or below. These contracts are for physical electricity purchases and sales, fuel purchases, fuel transportation and storage, energy price risk management, transmission, interest rate management, and construction of new generation at Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4.The maximum potential collateral requirements under these contracts at December 31, 2018 were as follows:Credit RatingsMaximumPotentialCollateralRequirements (in millions)At BBB- and/or Baa3$92Below BBB- and/or Baa3$1,106Included in these amounts are certain agreements that could require collateral in the event that either Georgia Power or Alabama Power (an affiliate of Georgia Power) has a credit rating change to below investment grade. Generally, collateral may be provided by a Southern Company guaranty, letter of credit, or cash. Additionally, a credit rating downgrade could impact the ability of Georgia Power to access capital markets and would be likely to impact the cost at which it does so.On February 28, 2018, Fitch downgraded the senior unsecured long-term debt rating of Georgia Power to A from A+ with a negative outlook. On August 9, 2018, Fitch downgraded the senior unsecured long-term debt rating of Georgia Power to A- from A. On September 28, 2018, Fitch assigned a negative rating outlook to the ratings of Southern Company and certain of its subsidiaries (including Georgia Power).On August 8, 2018, Moody's downgraded the senior unsecured debt rating of Georgia Power to Baa1 from A3. On September 28, 2018, Moody's revised its rating outlook for Georgia Power from negative to stable.As a result of the Tax Reform Legislation, certain financial metrics, such as the funds from operations to debt percentage, used by the credit rating agencies to assess Southern Company and its subsidiaries (including Georgia Power) may be negatively impacted. The Georgia Power Tax Reform Settlement Agreement approved by the Georgia PSC on April 3, 2018 is expected to help mitigate these potential adverse impacts to certain credit metrics by allowing a higher retail equity ratio until the conclusion of the Georgia Power 2019 Base Rate Case. See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Georgia Power – Rate Plans"" for additional information.Market Price RiskDue to cost-based rate regulation and other various cost recovery mechanisms, Georgia Power continues to have limited exposure to market volatility in interest rates, commodity fuel prices, and prices of electricity. To manage the volatility attributable to these exposures, Georgia Power nets the exposures, where possible, to take advantage of natural offsets and enters into various II-119 Table of Contents Index to Financial StatementsMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Georgia Power Company 2018 Annual Reportderivative transactions for the remaining exposures pursuant to Georgia Power's policies in areas such as counterparty exposure and risk management practices. Georgia Power's policy is that derivatives are to be used primarily for hedging purposes and mandates strict adherence to all applicable risk management policies. Derivative positions are monitored using techniques including, but not limited to, market valuation, value at risk, stress testing, and sensitivity analysis.To mitigate future exposure to changes in interest rates, Georgia Power may enter into derivatives designated as hedges. The weighted average interest rate on $0.9 billion of long-term variable interest rate exposure at December 31, 2018 was 2.57%. If Georgia Power sustained a 100 basis point change in interest rates for all long-term variable interest rate exposure, the change would affect annualized interest expense by approximately $9 million at December 31, 2018. See Note 1 to the financial statements under ""Financial Instruments"" and Note 14 to the financial statements for additional information.To mitigate residual risks relative to movements in electricity prices, Georgia Power enters into physical fixed-price contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity through the wholesale electricity market and, to a lesser extent, financial hedge contracts for natural gas purchases. Georgia Power continues to manage a fuel-hedging program implemented per the guidelines of the Georgia PSC. Georgia Power had no material change in market risk exposure for the year ended December 31, 2018 when compared to the December 31, 2017 reporting period.The changes in fair value of energy-related derivative contracts are substantially attributable to both the volume and the price of natural gas. For the years ended December 31, the changes in fair value of energy-related derivative contracts, the majority of which are composed of regulatory hedges, were as follows: 2018Changes 2017Changes Fair Value (in millions)Contracts outstanding at the beginning of the period, assets (liabilities), net$(13) $36Contracts realized or settled: Swaps realized or settled1 (13)Options realized or settled— (1)Current period changes(*): Swaps(3) (28)Options1 (7)Contracts outstanding at the end of the period, assets (liabilities), net$(14) $(13)(*)Current period changes also include the changes in fair value of new contracts entered into during the period, if any.The net hedge volumes of energy-related derivative contracts at December 31, 2018 and 2017 were as follows: 2018 2017 mmBtu Volume (in millions)Commodity – Natural gas swaps141 146Commodity – Natural gas options12 17Total hedge volume153 163The weighted average swap contract cost above market prices was approximately $0.10 per mmBtu and $0.08 per mmBtu at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The change in option fair value is primarily attributable to the volatility of the market and the underlying change in the natural gas price. All natural gas hedge gains and losses are recovered through Georgia Power's fuel cost recovery mechanism.At December 31, 2018 and 2017, substantially all of Georgia Power's energy-related derivative contracts were designated as regulatory hedges and were related to Georgia Power's fuel-hedging program, which had a time horizon up to 48 months. Hedging gains and losses are initially recorded as regulatory liabilities and assets, respectively, and then are included in fuel expense as they are recovered through the fuel cost recovery mechanism. Gains and losses on energy-related derivative contracts that are not designated or fail to qualify as hedges are recognized in the statements of income as incurred and were not material for any year presented.II-120 Table of Contents Index to Financial StatementsMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Georgia Power Company 2018 Annual ReportGeorgia Power uses over-the-counter contracts that are not exchange traded but are fair valued using prices which are market observable, and thus fall into Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. See Note 13 to the financial statements for further discussion of fair value measurements. The maturities of the energy-related derivative contracts, which are all Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, at December 31, 2018 were as follows: Fair Value MeasurementsDecember 31, 2018 Total Maturity Fair Value Year 1 Years 2&3 (in millions)Level 1$— $— $—Level 2(14) (6) (8)Level 3— — —Fair value of contracts outstanding at end of period$(14) $(6) $(8)Georgia Power is exposed to market price risk in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to the energy-related and interest rate derivative contracts. Georgia Power only enters into agreements and material transactions with counterparties that have investment grade credit ratings by Moody's and S&P or with counterparties who have posted collateral to cover potential credit exposure. Therefore, Georgia Power does not anticipate market risk exposure from nonperformance by the counterparties. For additional information, see Note 1 to the financial statements under ""Financial Instruments"" and Note 14 to the financial statements.Capital Requirements and Contractual ObligationsThe construction program of Georgia Power is currently estimated to total $3.7 billion for 2019, $3.5 billion for 2020, $3.4 billion for 2021, $3.4 billion for 2022, and $2.9 billion for 2023. These amounts include expenditures of approximately $1.5 billion, $1.2 billion, $1.0 billion, and $0.5 billion for the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 in 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022, respectively. These amounts also include capital expenditures related to contractual purchase commitments for nuclear fuel and capital expenditures covered under LTSAs. Estimated capital expenditures to comply with environmental laws and regulations included in these amounts are $0.2 billion, $0.1 billion, $0.1 billion, $0.2 billion, and $0.1 billion for 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023, respectively. These estimated expenditures do not include any potential compliance costs associated with pending regulation of CO2 emissions from fossil fuel-fired electric generating units. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – ""Environmental Matters – Environmental Laws and Regulations"" and "" – Global Climate Issues"" herein for additional information.Georgia Power also anticipates costs associated with closure and monitoring of ash ponds and landfills in accordance with the CCR Rule, which are reflected in Georgia Power's ARO liabilities. In December 2018, Georgia Power recorded an increase of approximately $3.1 billion to its AROs related to the CCR Rule and the related state rule. These costs, which are expected to change and could change materially as underlying assumptions are refined and the cost and the method and timing of compliance activities continue to be evaluated, are currently estimated to be $0.2 billion for 2019, $0.3 billion for 2020, $0.4 billion for 2021, $0.7 billion for 2022, and $0.6 billion for 2023. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – ""Environmental Matters – Environmental Laws and Regulations – Coal Combustion Residuals"" and Note 6 to the financial statements for additional information.The construction program is subject to periodic review and revision, and actual construction costs may vary from these estimates because of numerous factors. These factors include: changes in business conditions; changes in load projections; changes in environmental laws and regulations; the outcome of any legal challenges to environmental rules; changes in generating plants, including unit retirements and replacements and adding or changing fuel sources at existing generating units, to meet regulatory requirements; changes in FERC rules and regulations; Georgia PSC approvals; changes in the expected environmental compliance program; changes in legislation; the cost and efficiency of construction labor, equipment, and materials; project scope and design changes; storm impacts; and the cost of capital. In addition, there can be no assurance that costs related to capital expenditures will be fully recovered. The construction program also includes Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, which includes components based on new technology that only recently began initial operation in the global nuclear industry at this scale and which may be subject to additional revised cost estimates during construction. The ability to control costs and avoid cost and schedule overruns during the development, construction, and operation of new facilities is subject to a number of factors, including, but not limited to, changes in labor costs, availability, and productivity; challenges with management of contractors, subcontractors, or vendors; adverse weather conditions; shortages, increased costs, or inconsistent quality of equipment, materials, and labor; contractor or supplier II-121 Table of Contents Index to Financial StatementsMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Georgia Power Company 2018 Annual Reportdelay; non-performance under construction, operating, or other agreements; operational readiness, including specialized operator training and required site safety programs; engineering or design problems; design and other licensing-based compliance matters, including the timely resolution of ITAAC and the related approvals by the NRC; challenges with start-up activities, including major equipment failure and system integration; and/or operational performance. See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Georgia Power – Nuclear Construction"" for information regarding additional factors that may impact construction expenditures.As a result of requirements by the NRC, Georgia Power has established external trust funds for nuclear decommissioning costs.

These factors include Mississippi Power's ability to maintain and grow energy sales and to operate in a constructive regulatory environment that provides timely recovery of prudently-incurred costs. These costs include those related to reliability, fuel, and stringent environmental standards, as well as ongoing capital and operations and maintenance expenditures and restoration following major storms. Appropriately balancing required costs and capital expenditures with customer prices will continue to challenge Mississippi Power for the foreseeable future. Mississippi Power is scheduled to file a base rate case in the fourth quarter 2019 (Mississippi Power 2019 Base Rate Case).As a result of the Mississippi PSC's stated intent to issue an order establishing a new docket for a global settlement under which the Kemper County energy facility would be operated as a natural gas plant, rather than an IGCC plant (Kemper Settlement Docket), on June 28, 2017, Mississippi Power notified the Mississippi PSC that it would begin a process to suspend operations and start-up activities on the gasifier portion of the Kemper County energy facility. At the time of project suspension, the total cost estimate for the Kemper County energy facility was approximately $7.38 billion, including approximately $5.95 billion of costs subject to the construction cost cap. In the aggregate, Mississippi Power had incurred charges of $3.07 billion ($1.89 billion after tax) for changes in the cost estimate above the cost cap through May 31, 2017.Given the Mississippi PSC's stated intent regarding no additional rate increases for the Kemper County energy facility and the subsequent suspension of construction, cost recovery of the gasification portions was no longer probable. Therefore, Mississippi Power recorded a charge to income in June 2017 of $2.8 billion ($2.0 billion after tax) for the estimated costs associated with the gasification portions of the plant and lignite mine. During the third and fourth quarters 2017, Mississippi Power recorded further charges to income totaling $242 million ($206 million after tax), including $164 million for ongoing project costs, estimated mine and gasifier-related costs, and certain termination costs during the suspension period prior to conclusion of the Kemper Settlement Docket, as well as a charge associated with the Kemper Settlement Agreement discussed below.On February 6, 2018, the Mississippi PSC voted to approve a settlement agreement related to cost recovery for the Kemper County energy facility among Mississippi Power, the MPUS, and certain intervenors (Kemper Settlement Agreement), which resolved all cost recovery issues, modified the CPCN to limit the Kemper County energy facility to natural gas combined cycle operation, and provided for an annual revenue requirement of approximately $99.3 million for costs related to the Kemper County energy facility, which included the impact of the Tax Reform Legislation. The revenue requirement is based on (i) a fixed ROE for 2018 of 8.6% excluding any performance adjustment, (ii) a ROE for 2019 calculated in accordance with PEP, excluding the performance adjustment, (iii) for future years, a performance-based ROE calculated pursuant to PEP, and (iv) amortization periods for the related regulatory assets and liabilities of eight years and six years, respectively. The revenue requirement also reflects a disallowance related to a portion of Mississippi Power's investment in the Kemper County energy facility requested for inclusion in rate base, which was recorded in the fourth quarter 2017 as an additional charge to income of approximately $78 million ($85 million net of accumulated depreciation of $7 million) pre-tax ($48 million after tax). Under the Kemper Settlement Agreement, retail customer rates reflect a reduction of approximately $26.8 million annually, effective with the first billing cycle of April 2018, and include no recovery for costs associated with the gasifier portion of the Kemper County energy facility in 2018 or at any future date.In 2018, Mississippi Power recorded pre-tax charges to income of $37 million ($27 million after tax), primarily resulting from the abandonment and related closure activities and ongoing period costs, net of sales proceeds, for the mine and gasifier-related assets at the Kemper County energy facility. In addition, Mississippi Power recorded a credit to earnings of $95 million in the fourth quarter 2018 primarily resulting from the reduction of a valuation allowance for a state income tax net operating loss (NOL) carryforward associated with the Kemper County energy facility. Additional closure costs for the mine and gasifier-related assets, currently estimated at up to $10 million pre-tax (excluding salvage, net of dismantlement costs), may be incurred through the first half of 2020. In addition, period costs, including, but not limited to, costs for compliance and safety, ARO accretion, and property taxes for the mine and gasifier-related assets, are estimated to total $11 million in 2019 and $2 million to $4 million annually in 2020 through 2023. Mississippi Power is currently evaluating its options regarding the final disposition of the CO2 pipeline, including removal of the pipeline. This evaluation is expected to be complete later in 2019. If Mississippi Power ultimately decides to remove the CO2 pipeline, the cost of removal would have a material impact on Mississippi Power's financial statements. The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.II-124 Table of Contents Index to Financial StatementsMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Mississippi Power Company 2018 Annual ReportSee Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Kemper County Energy Facility"" and Note 10 to the financial statements for additional information.On August 7, 2018 the Mississippi PSC approved settlement agreements between Mississippi Power and the MPUS with respect to the 2018 PEP filing and all unresolved PEP filings for prior years (PEP Settlement Agreement) and the 2018 ECO Plan filing (ECO Settlement Agreement). Rates under the PEP Settlement Agreement and the ECO Settlement Agreement resulted in annual revenue increases of approximately $21.6 million and $17 million, respectively, effective with the first billing cycle of September 2018 and are expected to continue through the conclusion of the Mississippi Power 2019 Base Rate Case.In August 2018, the Mississippi PSC began an operations review of Mississippi Power, for which the final report is expected prior to the conclusion of the Mississippi Power 2019 Base Rate Case. Mississippi Power expects that the review will include, but not be limited to, a comparative analysis of its costs, its cost recovery framework, and ways in which it may streamline management operations for the reasonable benefit of ratepayers. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – ""Retail Regulatory Matters"" herein and Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Mississippi Power"" for additional information.Mississippi Power continues to focus on several key performance indicators. In recognition that Mississippi Power's long-term financial success is dependent upon how well it satisfies its customers' needs, Mississippi Power's retail base rate mechanism, PEP, includes performance indicators that directly tie customer service indicators to Mississippi Power's allowed ROE. PEP measures Mississippi Power's performance on a 10-point scale as a weighted average of results in three areas: average customer price, as compared to prices of other regional utilities (weighted at 40%); service reliability, measured in percentage of time customers had electric service (40%); and customer satisfaction, measured in a survey of residential customers (20%). Mississippi Power also focuses on broader measures of customer satisfaction, plant availability, system reliability, and net income.Mississippi Power's financial success is directly tied to customer satisfaction. Key elements of ensuring customer satisfaction include outstanding service, high reliability, and competitive prices. Management uses customer satisfaction surveys to evaluate Mississippi Power's results and generally targets top-quartile performance.See RESULTS OF OPERATIONS herein for information on Mississippi Power's financial performance.EarningsMississippi Power's net income after dividends on preferred stock was $235 million in 2018 compared to a $2.59 billion net loss in 2017 and a $50 million net loss in 2016. The changes were primarily the result of pre-tax charges associated with the Kemper IGCC of $37 million, $3.36 billion, and $428 million, in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. The increase in net income in 2018 was partially offset by lower tax benefits and a decrease in AFUDC. See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Kemper County Energy Facility"" for additional information.II-125 Table of Contents Index to Financial StatementsMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Mississippi Power Company 2018 Annual ReportRESULTS OF OPERATIONSA condensed statement of operations follows: Amount Increase (Decrease)from Prior Year 2018 2018 2017 (in millions)Operating revenues$1,265 $78 $24Fuel405 10 52Purchased power41 16 (9)Other operations and maintenance313 22 (26)Depreciation and amortization169 8 29Taxes other than income taxes107 3 (5)Estimated loss on Kemper IGCC37 (3,325) 2,934Total operating expenses1,072 (3,266) 2,975Operating income 193 3,344 (2,951)Allowance for equity funds used during construction— (72) (52)Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized76 34 (32)Other income (expense), net17 16 3Income taxes (benefit)(102) 430 (428)Net income 236 2,824 (2,540)Dividends on preferred stock1 (1) —Net income after dividends on preferred stock$235 $2,825 $(2,540)Operating RevenuesOperating revenues for 2018 were $1.3 billion, reflecting a $78 million increase from 2017.

In addition, as a result of the PEP Settlement Agreement, Mississippi Power recognized revenues of $5 million previously II-126 Table of Contents Index to Financial StatementsMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Mississippi Power Company 2018 Annual Reportreserved in connection with the 2012 PEP lookback filing and deferred $17 million of revenue in 2017 following the complete amortization of certain regulatory assets related to the Kemper County energy facility. These increases were offset by a decrease of $16 million annually for base rates related to the Kemper County energy facility that became effective for the first billing cycle of April 2018 and the recognition in 2018 of regulatory liabilities of $5 million and $2 million, respectively, related to the equity ratio provisions of the PEP and ECO Settlement Agreements. Additionally, there was a $12 million increase as a result of colder weather in the first quarter and warmer weather in the second and third quarters in 2018 as compared to the corresponding periods in 2017 and a $5 million decrease in fuel and other cost recovery.Total retail revenues for 2017 decreased $5 million, or 0.6%, compared to 2016 primarily due to a $15 million decrease as a result of milder weather in 2017 as compared to 2016 and the deferral of $17 million of revenue following the complete amortization of certain regulatory assets related to the Kemper County energy facility in July 2017. These decreases were partially offset by a $10 million net increase related to ECO Plan rate changes in the third quarter 2016 and the second quarter 2017 and an increase of $13 million in fuel cost recovery.See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Mississippi Power – Environmental Compliance Overview Plan,"" "" – Performance Evaluation Plan,"" and "" – Kemper County Energy Facility – Rate Recovery"" for additional information. See ""Energy Sales"" below for a discussion of changes in the volume of energy sold, including changes related to sales and weather.Electric rates for Mississippi Power include provisions to adjust billings for fluctuations in fuel costs, including the energy component of purchased power costs. Under these provisions, fuel revenues generally equal fuel expenses, including the energy component of purchased power costs, and do not affect net income. Recoverable fuel costs include fuel and purchased power expenses reduced by the fuel and emissions portion of wholesale revenues from energy sold to customers outside Mississippi Power's service territory. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – ""Retail Regulatory Matters – Fuel Cost Recovery"" herein for additional information.Wholesale revenues from power sales to non-affiliated utilities, including FERC-regulated MRA sales as well as market-based sales, were as follows: 2018 2017 2016 (in millions)Capacity and other$6 $15 $16Energy257 244 245Total non-affiliated$263 $259 $261Wholesale revenues from sales to non-affiliates will vary depending on fuel prices, the market prices of wholesale energy compared to the cost of Mississippi Power's and the Southern Company system's generation, demand for energy within the Southern Company system's electric service territory, and the availability of the Southern Company system's generation. Increases and decreases in energy revenues that are driven by fuel prices are accompanied by an increase or decrease in fuel costs and do not have a significant impact on net income. In addition, Mississippi Power provides service under long-term contracts with rural electric cooperative associations and municipalities located in southeastern Mississippi under cost-based electric tariffs which are subject to regulation by the FERC. The contracts with these wholesale customers represented 17.3% of Mississippi Power's total operating revenues in 2018 and are generally subject to 10-year rolling cancellation notices. Historically, these wholesale customers have acted as a group and any changes in contractual relationships for one customer are likely to be followed by the other wholesale customers. Short-term opportunity energy sales are also included in sales for resale to non-affiliates. These opportunity sales are made at market-based rates that generally provide a margin above Mississippi Power's variable cost to produce the energy.Wholesale revenues from sales to affiliates will vary depending on demand and the availability and cost of generating resources at each company. These affiliate sales are made in accordance with the IIC, as approved by the FERC. These transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings since this energy is generally sold at marginal cost.Wholesale revenues from sales to affiliates increased $35 million, or 62.5%, in 2018 compared to 2017 and increased $30 million, or 115.4%, in 2017 compared to 2016. The increases in 2018 and 2017 were primarily due to $19 million and $9 million, respectively, associated with higher natural gas prices and $16 million and $21 million, respectively, associated with increases in KWH sales due to the dispatch of Mississippi Power's lower cost generation resources to serve Southern Company system territorial load. II-127 Table of Contents Index to Financial StatementsMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Mississippi Power Company 2018 Annual ReportEnergy SalesChanges in revenues are influenced heavily by the change in the volume of energy sold from year to year. KWH sales for 2018 and the percent change from the prior year were as follows: TotalKWHs Total KWHPercent Change Weather-Adjusted Percent Change 2018 2018 2017 2018 2017 (in millions) Residential2,113 8.7 % (5.2)% 1.4 % 1.4 %Commercial2,797 1.2 (2.7) (0.7) (0.1)Industrial4,924 1.7 (1.3) 1.7 (1.3)Other37 (4.1) (1.6) (4.1) (1.6)Total retail9,871 2.9 (2.5) 0.9 % (0.4)%Wholesale Non-affiliated3,980 8.4 (6.3) Affiliated2,584 27.7 82.7 Total wholesale6,564 15.3 14.0 Total energy sales16,435 7.5 % 2.8 % Changes in retail energy sales are generally the result of changes in electricity usage by customers, changes in weather, and changes in the number of customers. Retail energy sales increased 2.9% in 2018 as compared to the prior year. This increase was primarily the result of colder weather in the first quarter and warmer weather in the second and third quarters 2018 as compared to the corresponding periods in 2017. Weather-adjusted residential KWH sales increased in 2018 primarily due to increased customer usage. Weather-adjusted commercial KWH sales decreased primarily due to decreased customer usage slightly offset by customer growth. The increase in industrial KWH energy sales was primarily due to Hurricane Nate, which negatively impacted several large industrial customers in 2017.Retail energy sales decreased 2.5% in 2017 as compared to the prior year. This decrease was primarily the result of milder weather in 2017 as compared to 2016. Weather-adjusted residential KWH sales increased in 2017 primarily due to increased customer usage. Weather-adjusted commercial KWH sales decreased primarily due to decreased customer usage largely offset by customer growth. The decrease in industrial KWH energy sales was primarily due to Hurricane Nate, which negatively impacted several large industrial customers.See ""Operating Revenues"" above for a discussion of significant changes in wholesale revenues to affiliated companies.Fuel and Purchased Power ExpensesThe mix of fuel sources for generation of electricity is determined primarily by demand, the unit cost of fuel consumed, and the availability of generating units. Additionally, Mississippi Power purchases a portion of its electricity needs from the wholesale market.II-128 Table of Contents Index to Financial StatementsMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Mississippi Power Company 2018 Annual ReportDetails of Mississippi Power's generation and purchased power were as follows: 2018 2017 2016Total generation (in millions of KWHs)15,966 15,319 14,514Total purchased power (in millions of KWHs)(*)1,210 724 1,098Sources of generation (percent) – Gas93 92 91Coal7 8 9Cost of fuel, generated (in cents per net KWH) – Gas2.65 2.69 2.41Coal3.50 3.64 3.91Average cost of fuel, generated (in cents per net KWH)2.72 2.77 2.55Average cost of purchased power (in cents per net KWH)(*)3.39 3.50 3.07(*)Adjusted to include the impacts of station service in 2018 and test period energy produced in 2017 and 2016 for the Kemper County energy facility, which was accounted for in accordance with FERC guidance.Fuel and purchased power expenses were $446 million in 2018, an increase of $26 million, or 6.2%, as compared to the prior year. The increase was primarily due to a $35 million increase in KWHs generated and purchased, partially offset by a $9 million decrease in the average cost of generation and purchased power.Fuel and purchased power expenses were $420 million in 2017, an increase of $43 million, or 11.4%, as compared to the prior year. The increase was primarily due to a $36 million increase in the average cost of generation and purchased power and a net increase of $7 million in KWHs generated from gas generation.Fuel and purchased power energy transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings, since energy expenses are generally offset by energy revenues through Mississippi Power's fuel cost recovery clauses. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – ""Retail Regulatory Matters – Fuel Cost Recovery"" herein and Note 1 to the financial statements under ""Fuel Costs"" for additional information.FuelFuel expense increased $10 million, or 2.5%, in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to a 5.2% increase in KWHs generated from gas generation. Fuel expense increased $52 million, or 15.2%, in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to an 11.6% higher cost of natural gas.Purchased Power Purchased power expense increased $16 million, or 64.0%, in 2018 compared to 2017. The increase was primarily the result of a 67% increase in the volume of KWHs purchased. Purchased power expense decreased $9 million, or 26.5%, in 2017 compared to 2016. The decrease was primarily the result of a 34% decrease in the volume of KWHs purchased, offset by a 13.9% increase in the average cost per KWH purchased compared to 2016. The changes in the volume of KWHs purchased primarily reflect the impact of test period energy offsets in 2017.Energy purchases will vary depending on the market prices of wholesale energy as compared to the cost of the Southern Company system's generation, demand for energy within the Southern Company system's service territory, and the availability of the Southern Company system's generation. These purchases are made in accordance with the IIC or other contractual agreements, as approved by the FERC.Other Operations and Maintenance ExpensesOther operations and maintenance expenses increased $22 million, or 7.6%, in 2018 compared to the prior year. The increase was primarily due to a $15 million increase related to an employee attrition plan, a $12 million increase in planned generation outage cost, and a $7 million increase related to overhead line maintenance and vegetation management. These increases were partially offset by the deferral of $4 million of compensation costs in accordance with the PEP Settlement Agreement. See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Mississippi Power – Performance Evaluation Plan"" for additional information.Other operations and maintenance expenses decreased $26 million, or 8.2%, in 2017 compared to the prior year. The decrease was primarily due to a $10 million decrease in transmission and distribution expenses related to overhead line maintenance, an $8 million decrease in contractor services related to facilities, corporate advertising, and employee compensation and benefits, and an II-129 Table of Contents Index to Financial StatementsMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Mississippi Power Company 2018 Annual Report$8 million decrease related to the combined cycle and the associated common facilities portion of the Kemper County energy facility.Depreciation and AmortizationDepreciation and amortization increased $8 million, or 5.0%, in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to $8 million of amortization related to the ECO Plan and $6 million of depreciation for additional plant in service. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $4 million in amortization of regulatory assets associated with Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS) rule compliance.Depreciation and amortization increased $29 million, or 22.0%, in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to $13 million of amortization related to the ECO Plan, $7 million of depreciation for additional plant in service, and $6 million in additional amortization of regulatory assets associated with MATS rule compliance.See Note 5 to the financial statements under ""Depreciation and Amortization"" and Note 2 to the financial statements under ""FERC Matters"" and ""Mississippi Power – Environmental Compliance Overview Plan"" for additional information.Estimated Loss on Kemper IGCCIn 2018, 2017, and 2016, charges of $37 million, $3.36 billion, and $428 million, respectively, associated with the Kemper IGCC were recorded. The 2018 pre-tax charge of $37 million primarily resulted from the abandonment and related closure activities and ongoing period costs, net of sales proceeds, for the mine and gasifier-related assets at the Kemper County energy facility. In June 2017, Mississippi Power suspended the gasifier portion of the project and recorded a charge to earnings for the remaining $2.8 billion book value of the gasifier portion of the project. Prior to the suspension, Mississippi Power recorded losses for revisions of estimated costs expected to be incurred on construction of the Kemper IGCC in excess of the $2.88 billion cost cap established by the Mississippi PSC, net of $245 million of grants awarded to the project by the DOE under the Clean Coal Power Initiative Round 2 and excluding the cost of the lignite mine and equipment, the cost of the CO2 pipeline facilities, AFUDC, and certain general exceptions (Cost Cap Exceptions).See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Kemper County Energy Facility"" for additional information.Allowance for Equity Funds Used During Construction AFUDC equity decreased $72 million, or 100.0%, in 2018 as compared to 2017 and $52 million, or 41.9%, in 2017 as compared to 2016 as a result of suspending construction of the Kemper IGCC in June 2017. See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Kemper County Energy Facility"" for additional information.Interest Expense, Net of Amounts CapitalizedInterest expense, net of amounts capitalized increased $34 million, or 81.0%, in 2018 compared to 2017. The increase was primarily associated with a $33 million net reduction in interest recorded in 2017 following a settlement with the IRS related to research and experimental (R&E) deductions. The increase also reflects a $29 million reduction in interest capitalized as a result of suspending construction of the Kemper IGCC in June 2017, offset by decreases of $12 million in interest expense as a result of lower average outstanding debt, $8 million related to uncertain tax positions, and $7 million due to the completion of Kemper IGCC carrying cost amortization in 2017. Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized decreased $32 million, or 43.2%, in 2017 compared to 2016. The decrease was primarily associated with a $33 million net reduction in interest following a settlement with the IRS related to R&E deductions. Also contributing to the decrease was the amortization of $6 million in interest deferrals in accordance with an order the Mississippi PSC issued in December 2015 (In-Service Asset Rate Order) and a $7 million decrease in interest related to outstanding debt as a result of lower balances and lower rates. These decreases were partially offset by a $20 million reduction in interest capitalized as a result of suspending construction of the Kemper IGCC.See Note 10 to the financial statements under ""Section 174 Research and Experimental Deduction"" for additional information.Other Income (Expense), NetOther income (expense), net increased $16 million in 2018 compared to 2017. The increase primarily reflects the $24 million settlement of Mississippi Power's Deepwater Horizon claim in May 2018, partially offset by a $7 million increase in charitable donations. See Note 3 to the financial statements under ""General Litigation Matters – Mississippi Power"" for additional information. Other income (expense), net increased $3 million in 2017 compared to 2016.II-130 Table of Contents Index to Financial StatementsMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Mississippi Power Company 2018 Annual ReportIncome Taxes (Benefit)Income tax benefits decreased $430 million, or 80.8%, in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to a $1.07 billion increase in income tax expense from higher pre-tax earnings primarily due to lower charges related to the Kemper County energy facility, net of the non-deductible AFUDC equity portion. This increase in income tax expense was partially offset by a $434 million decrease in income tax expense due to the impacts of the Tax Reform Legislation, including $407 million primarily associated with the revaluation of 2017 deferred tax assets related to the Kemper IGCC recorded in 2017 and $23 million associated with the lower federal income tax rate applicable in 2018, as well as $194 million related to the reduction in 2018 of a valuation allowance for a state income tax NOL carryforward recorded in 2017.Income tax benefits increased $428 million, or 411.5%, in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to $809 million in tax benefits on the estimated probable losses on the Kemper IGCC, net of the non-deductible AFUDC equity portion and the related state valuation allowances, partially offset by $372 million resulting from Tax Reform Legislation. Tax Reform Legislation earnings impacts are primarily due to revaluing deferred tax assets related to the Kemper County energy facility. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – ""Income Tax Matters"" herein and Note 10 to the financial statements for additional information.Effects of InflationMississippi Power is subject to rate regulation that is generally based on the recovery of historical and projected costs. The effects of inflation can create an economic loss since the recovery of costs could be in dollars that have less purchasing power. Any adverse effect of inflation on Mississippi Power's results of operations has not been substantial in recent years.FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIALGeneralMississippi Power operates as a vertically integrated utility providing electric service to retail customers within its traditional service territory located in southeast Mississippi and to wholesale customers in the Southeast. Prices for electricity provided by Mississippi Power to retail customers are set by the Mississippi PSC under cost-based regulatory principles. Retail rates and earnings are reviewed and may be adjusted periodically within certain limitations. Prices for wholesale electricity sales, interconnecting transmission lines, and the exchange of electric power are regulated by the FERC. See ""FERC Matters"" herein, ACCOUNTING POLICIES – ""Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – Utility Regulation"" herein, and Note 2 to the financial statements for additional information about regulatory matters.The results of operations for the past three years are not necessarily indicative of future earnings potential. The level of Mississippi Power's future earnings depends on numerous factors that affect the opportunities, challenges, and risks of Mississippi Power's business of providing electric service. These factors include Mississippi Power's ability to recover its prudently-incurred costs in a timely manner during a time of increasing costs and its ability to prevail against legal challenges associated with the Kemper County energy facility. Future earnings will be driven primarily by continued customer growth and the weak pace of growth in electricity use per customer, especially in residential and commercial markets. Earnings will also depend upon maintaining and growing sales, considering, among other things, the adoption and/or penetration rates of increasingly energy-efficient technologies and increasing volumes of electronic commerce transactions, both of which could contribute to a net reduction in customer usage. Earnings are subject to a variety of other factors. These factors include weather, competition, developing new and maintaining existing energy contracts and associated load requirements with other utilities and other wholesale customers, energy conservation practiced by customers, the use of alternative energy sources by customers, the price of electricity, the price elasticity of demand, and the rate of economic growth or decline in Mississippi Power's service territory. Demand for electricity is primarily driven by the pace of economic growth that may be affected by changes in regional and global economic conditions, which may impact future earnings.Mississippi Power's retail base rates are set under the PEP, a rate plan approved by the Mississippi PSC. Typically, two filings are made for each calendar year: the PEP projected filing, which is typically filed prior to the beginning of the year based on a projected revenue requirement, and the PEP lookback filing, which is filed after the end of the year and allows for review of the actual return compared to the allowed return range. Pursuant to the PEP Settlement Agreement, PEP proceedings are suspended until after the conclusion of the Mississippi Power 2019 Base Rate Case and Mississippi Power is not required to make any PEP filings for regulatory years 2018, 2019, and 2020. See ""Retail Regulatory Matters"" herein and Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Mississippi Power – Performance Evaluation Plan"" for more information.On October 2, 2018, the Mississippi PSC approved the executed agreements between Mississippi Power and its largest retail customer, Chevron, for Mississippi Power to continue providing retail service to the Chevron refinery in Pascagoula, Mississippi II-131 Table of Contents Index to Financial StatementsMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Mississippi Power Company 2018 Annual Reportthrough 2038. The new agreements are not expected to have a material impact on Mississippi Power's earnings; however, the co-generation assets located at the refinery are accounted for as a sales-type lease in accordance with the new lease accounting rules that became effective in 2019. These assets are also subject to a security interest granted to Chevron. See FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY – ""Credit Rating Risk"" herein for additional information.Mississippi Power provides service under long-term contracts with rural electric cooperative associations and municipalities located in southeastern Mississippi under cost-based electric tariffs which are subject to regulation by the FERC. The contracts with these wholesale customers represented 17.3% of Mississippi Power's total operating revenues in 2018 and are generally subject to 10-year rolling cancellation notices. Historically, these wholesale customers have acted as a group and any changes in contractual relationships for one customer are likely to be followed by the other wholesale customers.Environmental MattersMississippi Power's operations are regulated by state and federal environmental agencies through a variety of laws and regulations governing air, water, land, and protection of other natural resources. Mississippi Power maintains comprehensive environmental compliance and GHG strategies to assess upcoming requirements and compliance costs associated with these environmental laws and regulations. The costs, including capital expenditures, operations and maintenance costs, and costs reflected in ARO liabilities, required to comply with environmental laws and regulations and to achieve stated goals may impact future electric generating unit retirement and replacement decisions, results of operations, cash flows, and/or financial condition. Related costs may result from the installation of additional environmental controls, closure and monitoring of CCR facilities, unit retirements, or changing fuel sources for certain existing units, as well as related upgrades to Mississippi Power's transmission and distribution systems. A major portion of these costs is expected to be recovered through retail and wholesale rates. The ultimate impact of environmental laws and regulations and the GHG goals discussed herein will depend on various factors, such as state adoption and implementation of requirements, the availability and cost of any deployed technology, fuel prices, and the outcome of pending and/or future legal challenges.New or revised environmental laws and regulations could affect many areas of Mississippi Power's operations. The impact of any such changes cannot be determined at this time. Environmental compliance costs could affect earnings if such costs cannot continue to be recovered in rates on a timely basis or through long-term wholesale agreements. Further, increased costs that are recovered through regulated rates could contribute to reduced demand for electricity, which could negatively affect results of operations, cash flows, and/or financial condition. Additionally, many commercial and industrial customers may also be affected by existing and future environmental requirements, which for some may have the potential to ultimately affect their demand for electricity. See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Mississippi Power – Environmental Compliance Overview Plan"" for additional information.Through 2018, Mississippi Power has invested approximately $654 million in environmental capital retrofit projects to comply with environmental requirements, with annual totals of approximately $11 million, $9 million, and $17 million for 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. Although the timing, requirements, and estimated costs could change as environmental laws and regulations are adopted or modified, as compliance plans are revised or updated, and as legal challenges to rules are initiated or completed, Mississippi Power's current compliance strategy estimates capital expenditures of $73 million from 2019 through 2023, with annual totals of approximately $18 million, $20 million, $17 million, $5 million, and $13 million for 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023, respectively. These estimates do not include any potential compliance costs associated with pending regulation of CO2 emissions from fossil fuel-fired electric generating units. See ""Global Climate Issues"" herein for additional information. Mississippi Power also anticipates expenditures associated with ash pond closure and ground water monitoring under the CCR Rule, which are reflected in Mississippi Power's ARO liabilities. See FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY – ""Capital Requirements and Contractual Obligations"" herein and Note 6 to the financial statements for additional information.Environmental Laws and RegulationsAir QualityThe EPA has set National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for six air pollutants (carbon monoxide, lead, nitrogen dioxide, ozone, particulate matter, and SO2) to protect and improve the nation's air quality, which it reviews and revises periodically. Following a NAAQS revision, states are required to develop an EPA-approved plan to protect air quality. These state plans can require additional emission controls, improvements in control efficiency, or fuel changes which can result in increased compliance and operational costs. NAAQS requirements can also adversely affect the siting of new electric generating facilities. All areas within Mississippi Power's service territory have been designated as attainment for all NAAQS. If areas are designated as nonattainment in the future, increased compliance costs could result.II-132 Table of Contents Index to Financial StatementsMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Mississippi Power Company 2018 Annual ReportIn 2011, the EPA finalized the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR) to address impacts of SO2 and NOX emissions from fossil fuel-fired electric generating plants. CSAPR establishes emissions trading programs and budgets for certain states and allocates emissions allowances for sources in those states. In 2016, the EPA published a final rule establishing more stringent ozone season NOX emissions budgets in Alabama and Mississippi. The outcome of ongoing CSAPR litigation concerning the 2016 CSAPR rule, to which Mississippi Power is a party, could have an impact on the State of Mississippi's ozone season NOX emissions budget. Increases in either future fossil fuel-fired generation or the availability or cost of CSAPR allowances could have a negative financial impact on results of operations for Mississippi Power.The EPA finalized regional haze regulations in 2005 and 2017. These regulations require states, tribal governments, and various federal agencies to develop and implement plans to reduce pollutants that impair visibility and demonstrate reasonable progress toward the goal of restoring natural visibility conditions in certain areas, including national parks and wilderness areas. States must submit a revised state implementation plan (SIP) to the EPA demonstrating continued reasonable progress towards achieving visibility improvement goals. These plans could require reductions in certain pollutants, such as particulate matter, SO2, and NOX, which could result in increased compliance costs. The EPA issued a limited approval of the regional progress SIP for the State of Mississippi because Mississippi must revise the best available retrofit technology (BART) provisions of its SIP. Therefore, Plant Daniel continues to be evaluated under the regional haze BART provisions. Mississippi Power is required to submit Plant Daniel's BART analysis to the State of Mississippi by summer 2019. Requirements for further reduction of these pollutants at Plant Daniel could increase compliance costs.Water QualityIn 2014, the EPA finalized requirements under Section 316(b) of the Clean Water Act (CWA) to regulate cooling water intake structures (CWIS) to minimize their effects on fish and other aquatic life at existing power plants (e.g. coal, natural gas, oil, and nuclear generating plants) and manufacturing facilities. The regulation requires plant-specific studies to determine applicable CWIS changes to protect organisms that either get caught on the intake screens (impingement) or are drawn into the cooling system (entrainment). Mississippi Power is conducting these studies and currently anticipates applicable CWIS changes may include fish-friendly CWIS screens with fish return systems and minor additions of monitoring equipment at certain plants. However, the ultimate impact of this rule will depend on the outcome of these plant-specific studies, any additional protective measures required to be incorporated into each plant's National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit based on site-specific factors, and the outcome of any legal challenges.In 2015, the EPA finalized the steam electric effluent limitations guidelines (ELG) rule (2015 ELG Rule) that set national standards for wastewater discharges from new and existing steam electric generating units generating greater than 50 MWs. The 2015 ELG Rule prohibits effluent discharges of certain waste streams and imposes stringent limits on flue gas desulfurization (scrubber) wastewater discharges. The revised technology-based limits and the CCR Rule require extensive changes to existing ash and wastewater management systems or the installation and operation of new ash and wastewater management systems. Compliance with the 2015 ELG Rule is expected to require capital expenditures and increased operational costs primarily for Mississippi Power's coal-fired electric generation. State environmental agencies will incorporate specific compliance applicability dates in the NPDES permitting process for each ELG waste stream no later than December 31, 2023. The EPA is scheduled to issue a new rulemaking by December 2019 that could revise the limitations and applicability dates of two of the waste streams regulated in the 2015 ELG Rule. The impact of any changes to the 2015 ELG Rule will depend on the content of the new rule and the outcome of any legal challenges.In 2015, the EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) jointly published a final rule that revised the regulatory definition of waters of the United States (WOTUS) for all CWA programs. The rule significantly expanded the scope of federal jurisdiction over waterbodies (such as rivers, streams, canals, and wastewater treatment ponds), which could impact new generation projects and permitting and reporting requirements associated with the installation, expansion, and maintenance of transmission and distribution projects. The EPA and the Corps are expected to publish a final rule in 2019 to replace the 2015 WOTUS definition. The impact of any changes to the 2015 WOTUS rule will depend on the content of this final rule and the outcome of any legal challenges.Coal Combustion ResidualsIn 2015, the EPA finalized non-hazardous solid waste regulations for the disposal of CCR, including coal ash and gypsum, in landfills and surface impoundments (ash ponds) at active generating power plants. The EPA's CCR Rule requires landfills and ash ponds to be evaluated against a set of performance criteria and potentially closed if minimum criteria are not met. Closure of existing landfills and ash ponds could require installation of equipment and infrastructure to manage CCR in accordance with the CCR Rule. Based on cost estimates for closure and monitoring of landfills and ash ponds pursuant to the CCR Rule, Mississippi II-133 Table of Contents Index to Financial StatementsMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Mississippi Power Company 2018 Annual ReportPower recorded AROs for each CCR unit in 2015. As further analysis was performed and closure details were developed, Mississippi Power has continued to periodically update these cost estimates, as discussed further below.The EPA published certain amendments to the CCR Rule, which became effective August 29, 2018. These amendments extend the date from April 2019 to October 31, 2020 to cease sending CCR and other waste streams to ash ponds that demonstrate compliance with all except two of the specified performance criteria.On August 21, 2018, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit issued a decision suggesting the EPA should regulate previously-excluded inactive ash ponds located at retired generation facilities and questioning both the ability of unlined ash ponds to continue operating no matter the performance criteria results and the classification of clay-lined landfills and ash ponds. These developments could impact the expected timing of Mississippi Power's landfill and ash pond closure activities, but the extent of any impact will depend on the outcome of ongoing litigation, anticipated EPA rulemaking action to establish further guidance, and the outcome of any legal challenges.During 2018, Mississippi Power recorded increases of approximately $16 million to its AROs related to the CCR Rule. The increases include approximately $11 million based on information from feasibility studies performed on an ash pond at Plant Greene County, which is co-owned with Alabama Power, and approximately $5 million related to increases in post-closure care for Plant Watson's ash pond and landfill. The Alabama Power studies for Plant Greene County indicated that additional closure costs, primarily related to increases in estimated ash volume, water management requirements, and design revisions, will be required to close the ash pond under the planned closure-in-place methodology. As the level of work becomes more defined in the next 12 months, it is likely that these cost estimates will change and the change could be material. Mississippi Power expects to periodically update its ARO cost estimates.In 2016, the Mississippi PSC granted a CPCN to Mississippi Power authorizing certain projects associated with complying with the CCR Rule. Additionally in this order, the Mississippi PSC also authorized Mississippi Power to recover any costs associated with the CPCN, including future monitoring costs, through the ECO clause. Absent continued recovery of ARO costs through regulated rates, Mississippi Power's results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition could be materially impacted. See FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY – ""Capital Requirements and Contractual Obligations"" herein and Note 6 to the financial statements for additional information regarding Mississippi Power's AROs.The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.Environmental RemediationMississippi Power must comply with environmental laws and regulations governing the handling and disposal of waste and releases of hazardous substances. Under these various laws and regulations, Mississippi Power may also incur substantial costs to clean up affected sites. Mississippi Power has authority from the Mississippi PSC to recover approved environmental compliance costs through established regulatory mechanisms. Mississippi Power recognizes a liability for environmental remediation costs only when it determines a loss is probable and reasonably estimable.Global Climate IssuesOn August 31, 2018, the EPA published a proposed rule known as the Affordable Clean Energy (ACE) Rule, which is intended to replace a regulation enacted in 2015 known as the Clean Power Plan (CPP), that would limit CO2 emissions from existing fossil fuel-fired electric generating units. The CPP has been stayed by the U.S. Supreme Court since 2016. The ACE Rule would require states to develop GHG unit-specific emission rate standards based on heat-rate efficiency improvements for existing fossil fuel-fired steam units. As proposed, combustion turbines, including natural gas combined cycles, are not affected sources. As of January 1, 2019, Mississippi Power has ownership interests in six fossil fuel-fired steam units to which the proposed ACE Rule is applicable. The ultimate impact of this rule to Mississippi Power is currently unknown and will depend on changes between the proposal and the final rule, subsequent state plan developments and requirements, and any associated legal challenges.On December 20, 2018, the EPA published a proposed review of the Standards of Performance for Greenhouse Gas Emissions from New, Modified, and Reconstructed Stationary Sources: Electric Utility Generating Units final rule (2015 NSPS rule). The EPA's final 2015 NSPS rule set standards of performance for new, modified, and reconstructed electric utility generating units which included stationary combustion turbines and fossil-fired steam boilers. This proposal reduces the stringency of the 2015 NSPS rule by not basing the new and reconstructed fossil-fired steam boiler and IGCC standards on partial carbon capture and sequestration. The impact of any changes to this rule will depend on the content of the final rule and the outcome of any legal challenges.The EPA's GHG reporting rule requires annual reporting of GHG emissions expressed in terms of metric tons of CO2 equivalent emissions for a company's operational control of facilities. Based on ownership or financial control of facilities, Mississippi II-134 Table of Contents Index to Financial StatementsMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Mississippi Power Company 2018 Annual ReportPower's 2017 GHG emissions were approximately 8 million metric tons of CO2 equivalent. The preliminary estimate of Mississippi Power's 2018 GHG emissions on the same basis is approximately 8 million metric tons of CO2 equivalent.Through 2017, the Southern Company system has achieved an estimated GHG emission reduction of 36% since 2007. In April 2018, Southern Company established an intermediate goal of a 50% reduction in carbon emissions from 2007 levels by 2030 and a long-term goal of low- to no-carbon operations by 2050. To achieve these goals, the Southern Company system expects to continue growing its renewable energy portfolio, optimize technology advancements to modernize its transmission and distribution systems, increase the use of natural gas for generation, complete ongoing construction projects, invest in energy efficiency, and continue research and development efforts focused on technologies to lower GHG emissions. The Southern Company system's ability to achieve these goals also will be dependent on many external factors, including supportive national energy policies, low natural gas prices, and the development, deployment, and advancement of relevant energy technologies.FERC MattersMunicipal and Rural Associations TariffMississippi Power provides wholesale electric service to Cooperative Energy, East Mississippi Electric Power Association, and the City of Collins, all located in southeastern Mississippi, under a long-term cost-based, FERC-regulated MRA tariff. In 2016, Mississippi Power reached a settlement agreement with its wholesale customers, which was subsequently approved by the FERC, for an increase in wholesale base revenues under the MRA cost-based electric tariff, primarily as a result of placing scrubbers for Plant Daniel Units 1 and 2 in service in 2015. The settlement agreement became effective for services rendered beginning May 1, 2016, resulting in an estimated annual revenue increase of $7 million under the MRA cost-based electric tariff. Additionally, under the settlement agreement, the tariff customers agreed to similar regulatory treatment for MRA tariff ratemaking as the treatment approved for retail ratemaking under the In-Service Asset Rate Order. This regulatory treatment primarily included (i) recovery of the operational Kemper County energy facility assets providing service to customers and other related costs, (ii) amortization of the Kemper County energy facility-related regulatory assets included in rates under the settlement agreement over the 36 months ending April 30, 2019, (iii) Kemper County energy facility-related expenses included in rates under the settlement agreement no longer being deferred and charged to expense, and (iv) removing all of the Kemper County energy facility CWIP from rate base with a corresponding increase in accrual of AFUDC, which totaled approximately $22 million through the suspension of Kemper IGCC start-up activities.Mississippi Power expects to reach a subsequent settlement agreement with its wholesale customers and will make a filing with the FERC during the first quarter 2019. The settlement agreement is intended to be consistent with the Kemper Settlement Agreement, including the impact of the Tax Reform Legislation. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time. In September 2017, Mississippi Power and Cooperative Energy executed a Shared Service Agreement (SSA), as part of the MRA tariff, under which Mississippi Power and Cooperative Energy will share in providing electricity to all Cooperative Energy delivery points, in lieu of the current arrangement under which each delivery point is specifically assigned to either entity. The SSA accepted by the FERC in October 2017 became effective on January 1, 2018 and may be cancelled by Cooperative Energy with 10 years notice after December 31, 2020. The SSA provides Cooperative Energy the option to decrease its use of Mississippi Power's generation services under the MRA tariff, subject to annual and cumulative caps and a one-year notice requirement. In the event Cooperative Energy elects to reduce these services, the related reduction in Mississippi Power's revenues is not expected to be significant through 2020.Fuel Cost RecoveryMississippi Power has a wholesale MRA and a Market Based (MB) fuel cost recovery factor. Effective with the first billing cycle for January 2018, fuel rates increased $11 million annually for wholesale MRA customers and $1 million annually for wholesale MB customers. Effective January 1, 2019, the wholesale MRA fuel rate decreased $16 million annually and the wholesale MB fuel rate decreased by an immaterial amount. At December 31, 2018, over recovered wholesale MRA fuel costs included in other regulatory liabilities, current on the balance sheet were approximately $6 million compared to an immaterial amount at December 31, 2017. Under recovered wholesale MB fuel costs included in the balance sheets were immaterial at December 31, 2018 and 2017. Mississippi Power's operating revenues are adjusted for differences in actual recoverable fuel cost and amounts billed in accordance with the currently approved cost recovery rate. Accordingly, changes in the billing factor should have no significant effect on Mississippi Power's revenues or net income, but will affect cash flow.II-135 Table of Contents Index to Financial StatementsMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Mississippi Power Company 2018 Annual ReportOpen Access Transmission TariffOn May 10, 2018, AMEA and Cooperative Energy filed with the FERC a complaint against SCS and the traditional electric operating companies (including Mississippi Power) claiming that the current 11.25% base ROE used in calculating the annual transmission revenue requirements of the traditional electric operating companies' (including Mississippi Power's) open access transmission tariff is unjust and unreasonable as measured by the applicable FERC standards. The complaint requested that the base ROE be set no higher than 8.65% and that the FERC order refunds for the difference in revenue requirements that results from applying a just and reasonable ROE established in this proceeding upon determining the current ROE is unjust and unreasonable. On June 18, 2018, SCS and the traditional electric operating companies (including Mississippi Power) filed their response challenging the adequacy of the showing presented by the complainants and offering support for the current ROE. On September 6, 2018, the FERC issued an order establishing a refund effective date of May 10, 2018 in the event a refund is due and initiating an investigation and settlement procedures regarding the current base ROE. Through December 31, 2018, the estimated maximum potential refund is not expected to be material to Mississippi Power's results of operations or cash flows. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.Cooperative Energy Power Supply AgreementIn 2008, Mississippi Power entered into a 10-year power supply agreement (PSA) with Cooperative Energy for approximately 152 MWs, which became effective in 2011. Following certain plant retirements, the PSA capacity was reduced to 86 MWs. On February 5, 2018, Mississippi Power and Cooperative Energy executed an amendment to extend the PSA through March 31, 2021, effective April 1, 2018, which increased total capacity by 286 MWs.Cooperative Energy also has a 10-year network integration transmission service agreement (NITSA) with SCS for transmission service to certain delivery points on Mississippi Power's transmission system that became effective in 2011. As a result of the PSA amendment, Cooperative Energy and SCS amended the terms of the NITSA, which the FERC approved, to provide for the purchase of incremental transmission capacity for service beginning April 1, 2018 through March 31, 2021.Retail Regulatory MattersMississippi Power's rates and charges for service to retail customers are subject to the regulatory oversight of the Mississippi PSC. Mississippi Power's rates are a combination of base rates and several separate cost recovery clauses for specific categories of costs. These separate cost recovery clauses address such items as fuel and purchased power, energy efficiency programs, ad valorem taxes, property damage, and the costs of compliance with environmental laws and regulations. Costs not addressed through one of the specific cost recovery clauses are expected to be recovered through Mississippi Power's base rates. See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Mississippi Power"" for additional information.Operations ReviewIn August 2018, the Mississippi PSC began an operations review of Mississippi Power, for which the final report is expected prior to the conclusion of the Mississippi Power 2019 Base Rate Case. Mississippi Power expects that the review will include, but not be limited to, a comparative analysis of its costs, its cost recovery framework, and ways in which it may streamline management operations for the reasonable benefit of ratepayers. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time. Performance Evaluation PlanMississippi Power's retail base rates generally are set under the PEP, a rate plan approved by the Mississippi PSC. Two filings are made for each calendar year: the PEP projected filing, which is typically filed prior to the beginning of the year based on a projected revenue requirement, and the PEP lookback filing, which is filed after the end of the year and allows for review of the actual revenue requirement compared to the projected filing.In 2011, Mississippi Power submitted its annual PEP lookback filing for 2010, which recommended no surcharge or refund. Later in 2011, the MPUS disputed certain items in the 2010 PEP lookback filing. In 2012, the Mississippi PSC issued an order canceling Mississippi Power's PEP lookback filing for 2011. In 2013, the MPUS contested Mississippi Power's PEP lookback filing for 2012, which indicated a refund due to customers of $5 million. In 2014 through 2018, Mississippi Power submitted its annual PEP lookback filings for the prior years, which for each of 2013, 2014, and 2017 indicated no surcharge or refund and for each of 2015 and 2016 indicated a $5 million surcharge. Additionally, in July 2016, in November 2016, and in November 2017, Mississippi Power submitted its annual projected PEP filings for 2016, 2017, and 2018, respectively, which for 2016 and 2017 indicated no change in rates and for 2018 indicated a rate increase of 4%, or $38 million in annual revenues. The Mississippi PSC suspended each of these filings to allow more time for review.II-136 Table of Contents Index to Financial StatementsMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Mississippi Power Company 2018 Annual ReportOn February 7, 2018, Mississippi Power revised its annual projected PEP filing for 2018 to reflect the impacts of the Tax Reform Legislation. The revised filing requested an increase of $26 million in annual revenues, based on a performance adjusted ROE of 9.33% and an increased equity ratio of 55%. On July 27, 2018, Mississippi Power and the MPUS entered into the PEP Settlement Agreement, which was approved by the Mississippi PSC on August 7, 2018. Rates under the PEP Settlement Agreement became effective with the first billing cycle of September 2018. The PEP Settlement Agreement provides for an increase of approximately $21.6 million in annual base retail revenues, which excludes certain compensation costs contested by the MPUS, as well as approximately $2 million which was subsequently approved for recovery through the 2018 Energy Efficiency Cost Rider as discussed below. Under the PEP Settlement Agreement, Mississippi Power is deferring the contested compensation costs for 2018 and 2019 as a regulatory asset, which totaled $4 million as of December 31, 2018 and is included in other regulatory assets, deferred on the balance sheet. The Mississippi PSC is currently expected to rule on the appropriate treatment for such costs in connection with the Mississippi Power 2019 Base Rate Case. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time. Pursuant to the PEP Settlement Agreement, Mississippi Power's performance-adjusted allowed ROE is 9.31% and its allowed equity ratio is capped at 51%, pending further review by the Mississippi PSC. In lieu of the requested equity ratio increase, Mississippi Power retained $44 million of excess accumulated deferred income taxes resulting from the Tax Reform Legislation until the conclusion of the Mississippi Power 2019 Base Rate Case. Further, Mississippi Power agreed to seek equity contributions sufficient to restore its equity ratio to 50% by December 31, 2018. Since Mississippi Power's actual average equity ratio for 2018 was more than 1% lower than the 50% target, Mississippi Power deferred the corresponding difference in its revenue requirement of approximately $4 million as a regulatory liability for resolution in the Mississippi Power 2019 Base Rate Case. Pursuant to the PEP Settlement Agreement, PEP proceedings are suspended until after the conclusion of the Mississippi Power 2019 Base Rate Case and Mississippi Power is not required to make any PEP filings for regulatory years 2018, 2019, and 2020. The PEP Settlement Agreement also resolved all open PEP filings with no change to customer rates. As a result, in the third quarter 2018, Mississippi Power recognized revenues of $5 million previously reserved in connection with the 2012 PEP lookback filing.Energy EfficiencyIn 2013, the Mississippi PSC approved an energy efficiency and conservation rule requiring electric and gas utilities in Mississippi serving more than 25,000 customers to implement energy efficiency programs and standards. Quick Start Plans, which include a portfolio of energy efficiency programs that are intended to provide benefits to a majority of customers, were extended by an order issued by the Mississippi PSC in July 2016, until the time the Mississippi PSC approves a comprehensive portfolio plan program. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.On May 8, 2018, the Mississippi PSC issued an order approving Mississippi Power's revised annual projected Energy Efficiency Cost Rider 2018 compliance filing, which increased annual retail revenues by approximately $3 million effective with the first billing cycle for June 2018. On February 5, 2019, the Mississippi PSC issued an order approving Mississippi Power's Energy Efficiency Cost Rider 2019 compliance filing, which included a slight decrease in annual retail revenues, effective with the first billing cycle in March 2019.Environmental Compliance Overview PlanIn accordance with a 2011 accounting order from the Mississippi PSC, Mississippi Power has the authority to defer in a regulatory asset for future recovery all plant retirement- or partial retirement-related costs resulting from environmental regulations. The Mississippi PSC approved $41 million and $17 million of costs that were reclassified to regulatory assets associated with the fuel conversion of Plant Watson and Plant Greene County, respectively, for amortization over five-year periods that began in July 2016 and July 2017, respectively. As a result, these decisions are not expected to have a material impact on Mississippi Power's financial statements.In August 2016, the Mississippi PSC approved Mississippi Power's revised ECO Plan filing for 2016, which requested the maximum 2% annual increase in revenues, or approximately $18 million, primarily related to the Plant Daniel Units 1 and 2 scrubbers placed in service in 2015. The revised rates became effective with the first billing cycle for September 2016. Approximately $22 million of related revenue requirements in excess of the 2% maximum was deferred for inclusion in the 2017 filing, along with related carrying costs. In May 2017, the Mississippi PSC approved Mississippi Power's ECO Plan filing for 2017, which requested the maximum 2% annual increase in revenues, or approximately $18 million, primarily related to the carryforward from the prior year. The rates became effective with the first billing cycle for June 2017. Approximately $26 million, plus carrying costs, of related revenue requirements in excess of the 2% maximum was deferred for inclusion in the 2018 filing.II-137 Table of Contents Index to Financial StatementsMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Mississippi Power Company 2018 Annual ReportOn February 14, 2018, Mississippi Power submitted its ECO Plan filing for 2018, including the effects of the Tax Reform Legislation, which requested the maximum 2% annual increase in revenues, or approximately $17 million, primarily related to the carryforward from the prior year.On August 3, 2018, Mississippi Power and the MPUS entered into the ECO Settlement Agreement, which provides for an increase of approximately $17 million in annual base retail revenues and was approved by the Mississippi PSC on August 7, 2018. Rates under the ECO Settlement Agreement became effective with the first billing cycle of September 2018 and will continue in effect until modified by the Mississippi PSC. These revenues are expected to be sufficient to recover the costs included in Mississippi Power's request for 2018, as well as the remaining deferred amounts, totaling $26 million at December 31, 2018, along with the related carrying costs. In accordance with the ECO Settlement Agreement, ECO Plan proceedings are suspended until after the conclusion of the Mississippi Power 2019 Base Rate Case and Mississippi Power is not required to make any ECO Plan filings for 2018, 2019, and 2020, with any necessary adjustments to be reflected in the Mississippi Power 2019 Base Rate Case. The ECO Settlement Agreement contains the same terms as the PEP Settlement Agreement described herein with respect to allowed ROE and equity ratio. At December 31, 2018, Mississippi Power has recorded $2 million in other regulatory liabilities, deferred on the balance sheet related to the actual December 31, 2018 average equity ratio differential from target applicable to the ECO Plan.Fuel Cost RecoveryMississippi Power establishes, annually, a retail fuel cost recovery factor that is approved by the Mississippi PSC. Mississippi Power is required to file for an adjustment to the retail fuel cost recovery factor annually. In January 2017, the Mississippi PSC approved the 2017 retail fuel cost recovery factor, effective February 2017 through January 2018, which resulted in an annual revenue increase of $55 million. On January 16, 2018, the Mississippi PSC approved the 2018 retail fuel cost recovery factor, effective February 2018 through January 2019, which resulted in an annual revenue increase of $39 million. At December 31, 2018, the amount of over recovered retail fuel costs included in the balance sheet in other accounts payable was approximately $8 million compared to $6 million under recovered at December 31, 2017. On January 10, 2019, the Mississippi PSC approved the 2019 retail fuel cost recovery factor, effective February 2019, which results in a $35 million decrease in annual revenues as a result of lower expected fuel costs.Mississippi Power's operating revenues are adjusted for differences in actual recoverable fuel cost and amounts billed in accordance with the currently approved cost recovery rate. Accordingly, changes in the billing factor should have no significant effect on Mississippi Power's revenues or net income but will affect operating cash flows.Ad Valorem Tax AdjustmentMississippi Power establishes annually an ad valorem tax adjustment factor that is approved by the Mississippi PSC to collect the ad valorem taxes paid by Mississippi Power. On May 8, 2018, the Mississippi PSC approved Mississippi Power's annual ad valorem tax adjustment factor filing for 2018, which included a rate increase of 0.8%, or $7 million, effective with the first billing cycle for June 2018.Kemper County Energy FacilityOverviewThe Kemper County energy facility was designed to utilize IGCC technology with an expected output capacity of 582 MWs and to be fueled by locally mined lignite (an abundant, lower heating value coal) from a mine owned by Mississippi Power and situated adjacent to the Kemper County energy facility. The mine, operated by North American Coal Corporation, started commercial operation in 2013. In connection with the Kemper County energy facility construction, Mississippi Power constructed approximately 61 miles of CO2 pipeline infrastructure for the transport of captured CO2 for use in enhanced oil recovery. Schedule and Cost EstimateIn 2012, the Mississippi PSC issued an order (2012 MPSC CPCN Order), confirming the CPCN originally approved by the Mississippi PSC in 2010 authorizing the acquisition, construction, and operation of the Kemper County energy facility. The certificated cost estimate of the Kemper County energy facility included in the 2012 MPSC CPCN Order was $2.4 billion, net of approximately $0.57 billion in Cost Cap Exceptions. The 2012 MPSC CPCN Order approved a construction cost cap of up to $2.88 billion, with recovery of prudently-incurred costs subject to approval by the Mississippi PSC. The Kemper County energy facility was originally projected to be placed in service in May 2014. Mississippi Power placed the combined cycle and the associated common facilities portion of the Kemper County energy facility in service in August 2014. The combined cycle and associated common facilities portions of the Kemper County energy facility were dedicated as Plant Ratcliffe on April 27, 2018. II-138 Table of Contents Index to Financial StatementsMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Mississippi Power Company 2018 Annual ReportOn June 21, 2017, the Mississippi PSC stated its intent to issue an order, which occurred on July 6, 2017, directing Mississippi Power to pursue a settlement under which the Kemper County energy facility would be operated as a natural gas plant, rather than an IGCC plant, and address all issues associated with the Kemper County energy facility. The order established the Kemper Settlement Docket. On June 28, 2017, Mississippi Power notified the Mississippi PSC that it would begin a process to suspend operations and start-up activities on the gasifier portion of the Kemper County energy facility, given the uncertainty as to its future. At the time of project suspension in June 2017, the total cost estimate for the Kemper County energy facility was approximately $7.38 billion, including approximately $5.95 billion of costs subject to the construction cost cap, and was net of the $137 million in additional grants from the DOE received in April 2016 (Additional DOE Grants). In the aggregate, Mississippi Power had recorded charges to income of $3.07 billion ($1.89 billion after tax) as a result of changes in the cost estimate above the cost cap for the Kemper IGCC through May 31, 2017.Given the Mississippi PSC's stated intent regarding no further rate increase for the Kemper County energy facility and the subsequent suspension, cost recovery of the gasifier portions became no longer probable; therefore, Mississippi Power recorded an additional charge to income in June 2017 of $2.8 billion ($2.0 billion after tax), which included estimated costs associated with the gasification portions of the plant and lignite mine. During the third and fourth quarters of 2017, Mississippi Power recorded charges to income of $242 million ($206 million after tax), including $164 million for ongoing project costs, estimated mine and gasifier-related costs, and certain termination costs during the suspension period prior to conclusion of the Kemper Settlement Docket, as well as the charge associated with the Kemper Settlement Agreement discussed below.In 2018, Mississippi Power recorded pre-tax charges to income of $37 million ($27 million after tax), primarily resulting from the abandonment and related closure activities and ongoing period costs, net of sales proceeds, for the mine and gasifier-related assets at the Kemper County energy facility. In addition, Mississippi Power recorded a credit to earnings of $95 million in the fourth quarter 2018 primarily resulting from the reduction of a valuation allowance for a state income tax NOL carryforward associated with the Kemper County energy facility. Additional closure costs for the mine and gasifier-related assets, currently estimated at up to $10 million pre-tax (excluding salvage, net of dismantlement costs), may be incurred through the first half of 2020. In addition, period costs, including, but not limited to, costs for compliance and safety, ARO accretion, and property taxes for the mine and gasifier-related assets, are estimated to total $11 million in 2019 and $2 million to $4 million annually in 2020 through 2023. Mississippi Power is currently evaluating its options regarding the final disposition of the CO2 pipeline, including removal of the pipeline. This evaluation is expected to be complete later in 2019. If Mississippi Power ultimately decides to remove the CO2 pipeline, the cost of removal would have a material impact on Mississippi Power's financial statements. The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.See Note 10 to the financial statements for additional information. Rate Recovery Kemper Settlement AgreementIn 2015, the Mississippi PSC issued the In-Service Asset Rate Order regarding the Kemper County energy facility assets that were commercially operational and providing service to customers (the transmission facilities, combined cycle, natural gas pipeline, and water pipeline) and other related costs. The In-Service Asset Rate Order provided for retail rate recovery of an annual revenue requirement of approximately $126 million which went into effect on December 17, 2015. On February 6, 2018, the Mississippi PSC voted to approve the Kemper Settlement Agreement, which resolved all cost recovery issues, modified the CPCN to limit the Kemper County energy facility to natural gas combined cycle operation, and provided for an annual revenue requirement of approximately $99.3 million for costs related to the Kemper County energy facility, which included the impact of the Tax Reform Legislation. The revenue requirement is based on (i) a fixed ROE for 2018 of 8.6% excluding any performance adjustment, (ii) a ROE for 2019 calculated in accordance with PEP, excluding the performance adjustment, (iii) for future years, a performance-based ROE calculated pursuant to PEP, and (iv) amortization periods for the related regulatory assets and liabilities of eight years and six years, respectively. The revenue requirement also reflects a disallowance related to a portion of Mississippi Power's investment in the Kemper County energy facility requested for inclusion in rate base, which was recorded in the fourth quarter 2017 as an additional charge to income of approximately $78 million ($85 million net of accumulated depreciation of $7 million) pre-tax ($48 million after tax). Under the Kemper Settlement Agreement, retail customer rates reflect a reduction of approximately $26.8 million annually, effective with the first billing cycle of April 2018, and include no recovery for costs associated with the gasifier portion of the Kemper County energy facility in 2018 or at any future date.II-139 Table of Contents Index to Financial StatementsMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Mississippi Power Company 2018 Annual ReportReserve Margin Plan On August 6, 2018, Mississippi Power filed its proposed Reserve Margin Plan (RMP), as required by the Mississippi PSC's order in the Kemper Settlement Docket. Under the RMP, Mississippi Power proposed alternatives that would reduce its reserve margin, with the most economic of the alternatives being the two-year and seven-year acceleration of the retirement of Plant Watson Units 4 and 5, respectively, to the first quarter 2022 and the four-year acceleration of the retirement of Plant Greene County Units 1 and 2 to the third quarter 2021 and the third quarter 2022, respectively, in order to lower or avoid operating costs. The Plant Greene County unit retirements would require the completion by Alabama Power of proposed transmission and system reliability improvements, as well as agreement by Alabama Power. The RMP filing also states that, in the event the Mississippi PSC ultimately approves an alternative that includes an accelerated retirement, Mississippi Power would require authorization to defer in a regulatory asset for future recovery the remaining net book value of the units at the time of retirement. A decision by the Mississippi PSC that does not include recovery of the remaining book value of any generating units retired could have a material impact on Mississippi Power's financial statements. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.Lignite Mine and CO2 Pipeline FacilitiesMississippi Power owns the lignite mine and equipment and mineral reserves located around the Kemper County energy facility site. The mine started commercial operation in June 2013.In 2010, Mississippi Power executed a 40-year management fee contract with Liberty Fuels Company, LLC (Liberty Fuels), a wholly-owned subsidiary of The North American Coal Corporation, which developed, constructed, and is responsible for the mining operations through the end of the mine reclamation. As the mining permit holder, Liberty Fuels has a legal obligation to perform mine reclamation and Mississippi Power has a contractual obligation to fund all reclamation activities. As a result of the abandonment of the Kemper IGCC, final mine reclamation began in 2018 and is expected to be substantially completed in 2020, with monitoring expected to continue through 2027. See Note 6 to the financial statements and Note 7 to the financial statements under ""Mississippi Power"" for additional information.In addition, Mississippi Power constructed the CO2 pipeline for the planned transport of captured CO2 for use in enhanced oil recovery and entered into an agreement with Denbury Onshore (Denbury) to purchase the captured CO2. The agreement with Denbury was terminated in December 2018 and did not have a material impact on Mississippi Power's results of operations. Mississippi Power is currently evaluating its options regarding the final disposition of the CO2 pipeline, including removal of the pipeline. This evaluation is expected to be complete later in 2019. If Mississippi Power ultimately decides to remove the CO2 pipeline, the cost of removal would have a material impact on Mississippi Power's financial statements. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.For additional information on the Kemper County energy facility, see Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Mississippi Power – Kemper County Energy Facility.""Government GrantsIn 2010, the DOE, through a cooperative agreement with SCS, agreed to fund $270 million of the Kemper County energy facility through the grants awarded to the project by the DOE under the Clean Coal Power Initiative Round 2. Through December 31, 2018, Mississippi Power received total DOE grants of $387 million, of which $382 million reduced the construction costs of the Kemper County energy facility and $5 million reimbursed Mississippi Power for expenses associated with DOE reporting. On December 12, 2018, Mississippi Power filed with the DOE its request for property closeout certification under the contract related to the grants received. Mississippi Power and the DOE are currently in discussions regarding the requested closeout and property disposition, which may require payment to the DOE for a portion of certain property that is to be retained by Mississippi Power. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time; however, it could have a material impact on Mississippi Power's financial statements.Income Tax MattersFederal Tax Reform LegislationIn December 2017, the Tax Reform Legislation was signed into law and became effective on January 1, 2018. The Tax Reform Legislation, among other things, reduced the federal corporate income tax rate to 21%, retained normalization provisions for public utility property and existing renewable energy incentives, and repealed the corporate alternative minimum tax. In addition, under the Tax Reform Legislation, NOLs generated after December 31, 2017 can no longer be carried back to previous tax years but can be carried forward indefinitely, with utilization limited to 80% of taxable income of the subsequent tax year. The projected reduction of Southern Company's consolidated income tax liability resulting from the tax rate reduction also delays the expected II-140 Table of Contents Index to Financial StatementsMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Mississippi Power Company 2018 Annual Reportutilization of existing tax credit carryforwards. See Note 10 to the financial statements for information on Southern Company's joint consolidated income tax allocation agreement.Following the enactment of the Tax Reform Legislation, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin 118 – ""Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act"" (SAB 118), which provided for a measurement period of up to one year from the enactment date to complete accounting under GAAP for the tax effects of the legislation. Due to the complex and comprehensive nature of the enacted tax law changes and their application under GAAP, Mississippi Power considered all amounts recorded in the financial statements as a result of the Tax Reform Legislation ""provisional"" as discussed in SAB 118 and subject to revision prior to filing its 2017 tax return in the fourth quarter 2018. Mississippi Power recognized tax expense of $372 million in 2017. Following the filing of its 2017 tax return, Mississippi Power recorded tax benefits of $35 million to adjust the provisional amount for a total net tax expense of $337 million as a result of the Tax Reform Legislation. In addition, in total, Mississippi Power recorded an $11 million increase in regulatory assets and a $395 million increase in regulatory liabilities as a result of the Tax Reform Legislation and $1 million of stranded excess deferred tax balances in AOCI at December 31, 2017 were adjusted through retained earnings in 2018. As of December 31, 2018, Mississippi Power considered the measurement of impacts from the Tax Reform Legislation on deferred income tax assets and liabilities, primarily due to the impact of the reduction of the corporate income tax rate, to be complete.However, the IRS continues to issue regulations that provide further interpretation and guidance on the law and each state's adoption of the provisions contained in the Tax Reform Legislation remains uncertain. In addition, the regulatory treatment of certain impacts of the Tax Reform Legislation is subject to the discretion of the FERC and the Mississippi PSC. The ultimate impact of this matter cannot be determined at this time. See Note 2 to the financial statements for additional information regarding the PEP Settlement Agreement and the ECO Settlement Agreement, which reflect certain impacts of the Tax Reform Legislation. Also see FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY – ""Credit Rating Risk"" herein and Note 10 to the financial statements under ""Current and Deferred Income Taxes"" for additional information.Bonus DepreciationUnder the Tax Reform Legislation, projects with binding contracts prior to September 28, 2017 and placed in service after September 27, 2017 remain eligible for bonus depreciation under the PATH Act. The PATH Act allowed for 50% bonus depreciation for 2015 through 2017, 40% bonus depreciation for 2018, and 30% bonus depreciation for 2019 and certain long-lived assets placed in service in 2020. Based on provisional estimates, bonus depreciation is expected to result in positive cash flows of approximately $10 million for the 2018 tax year and Mississippi Power does not expect material positive cash flows from bonus depreciation for the 2019 tax year. See Note 10 to the financial statements under ""Current and Deferred Income Taxes"" for additional information. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.Other MattersMississippi Power is involved in various other matters being litigated and regulatory matters that could affect future earnings. In addition, Mississippi Power is subject to certain claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. Mississippi Power's business activities are subject to extensive governmental regulation related to public health and the environment, such as laws and regulations governing air, water, land, and protection of other natural resources. Litigation over environmental issues and claims of various types, including property damage, personal injury, common law nuisance, and citizen enforcement of environmental laws and regulations, has occurred throughout the U.S. This litigation has included claims for damages alleged to have been caused by CO2 and other emissions, CCR, and alleged exposure to hazardous materials, and/or requests for injunctive relief in connection with such matters.The ultimate outcome of such pending or potential litigation or regulatory matters cannot be predicted at this time; however, for current proceedings not specifically reported herein or in Notes 2 and 3 to the financial statements, management does not anticipate that the ultimate liabilities, if any, arising from such current proceedings would have a material effect on Mississippi Power's financial statements. See Notes 2 and 3 to the financial statements for a discussion of various other contingencies, regulatory matters, and other matters being litigated which may affect future earnings potential.To mitigate customer rate impacts associated with rising costs and declining sales, Mississippi Power management approved an employee attrition plan on July 13, 2018. In 2018, Mississippi Power recorded $16 million in expenses related to this plan.On October 2, 2018, the Mississippi PSC approved the executed agreements between Mississippi Power and its largest retail customer, Chevron, for Mississippi Power to continue providing retail service to the Chevron refinery in Pascagoula, Mississippi through 2038. The new agreements are not expected to have a material impact on earnings.In conjunction with Southern Company's sale of Gulf Power, Mississippi Power and Gulf Power have committed to seek a restructuring of their 50% undivided ownership interests in Plant Daniel such that each of them would, after the restructuring, II-141 Table of Contents Index to Financial StatementsMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Mississippi Power Company 2018 Annual Reportown 100% of a generating unit. On January 15, 2019, Gulf Power provided notice to Mississippi Power that Gulf Power will retire its share of the generating capacity of Plant Daniel on January 15, 2024. Mississippi Power has the option to purchase Gulf Power's ownership interest for $1 on January 15, 2024, provided that Mississippi Power exercises the option no later than 120 days prior to that date. Mississippi Power is assessing the potential operational and economic effects of Gulf Power's notice. The ultimate outcome of these matters remains subject to completion of Mississippi Power's evaluations and applicable regulatory approvals, including the FERC and the Mississippi PSC, and cannot now be determined. See Note 15 to the financial statements under ""Southern Company's Sale of Gulf Power"" for information regarding the sale of Gulf Power.LitigationOn May 18, 2018, Southern Company and Mississippi Power received a notice of dispute and arbitration demand filed by Martin Product Sales, LLC (Martin) based on two agreements, both related to Kemper IGCC byproducts for which Mississippi Power provided termination notices in September 2017. Martin alleges breach of contract, breach of good faith and fair dealing, fraud and misrepresentation, and civil conspiracy and makes a claim for damages in the amount of approximately $143 million, as well as additional unspecified damages, attorney's fees, costs, and interest. In the first quarter 2019, Mississippi Power and Southern Company filed motions to dismiss.On November 21, 2018, Ray C. Turnage and 10 other individual plaintiffs filed a putative class action complaint against Mississippi Power and the three current members of the Mississippi PSC in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi. Mississippi Power received Mississippi PSC approval in 2013 to charge a mirror CWIP rate premised upon including in its rate base pre-construction and construction costs for the Kemper IGCC prior to placing the Kemper IGCC into service. The Mississippi Supreme Court reversed that approval and ordered Mississippi Power to refund the amounts paid by customers under the previously-approved mirror CWIP rate. The plaintiffs allege that the initial approval process, and the amount approved, were improper. They also allege that Mississippi Power underpaid customers in the refund process because it applied the wrong interest rate to the payments. The plaintiffs seek to recover, on behalf of themselves and their putative class, actual damages, punitive damages, pre-judgment interest, post-judgment interest, attorney's fees, and costs.Mississippi Power believes these legal challenges have no merit; however, an adverse outcome in either of these proceedings could have a material impact on Mississippi Power's results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. Mississippi Power will vigorously defend itself in these matters, the ultimate outcome of which cannot be determined at this time.See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Kemper County Energy Facility"" for additional information.ACCOUNTING POLICIESApplication of Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesMississippi Power prepares its financial statements in accordance with GAAP. Significant accounting policies are described in Notes 1, 5, and 6 to the financial statements. In the application of these policies, certain estimates are made that may have a material impact on Mississippi Power's results of operations and related disclosures. Different assumptions and measurements could produce estimates that are significantly different from those recorded in the financial statements. Senior management has reviewed and discussed the following critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of Southern Company's Board of Directors.Utility RegulationMississippi Power is subject to retail regulation by the Mississippi PSC and wholesale regulation by the FERC. These regulatory agencies set the rates Mississippi Power is permitted to charge customers based on allowable costs. As a result, Mississippi Power applies accounting standards which require the financial statements to reflect the effects of rate regulation. Through the ratemaking process, the regulators may require the inclusion of costs or revenues in periods different than when they would be recognized by a non-regulated company. This treatment may result in the deferral of expenses and the recording of related regulatory assets based on anticipated future recovery through rates or the deferral of gains or creation of liabilities and the recording of related regulatory liabilities. The application of the accounting standards has a further effect on Mississippi Power's financial statements as a result of the estimates of allowable costs used in the ratemaking process. These estimates may differ from those actually incurred by Mississippi Power; therefore, the accounting estimates inherent in specific costs such as depreciation and pension and other postretirement benefits have less of a direct impact on Mississippi Power's results of operations and financial condition than they would on a non-regulated company.As reflected in Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Mississippi Power – Regulatory Assets and Liabilities,"" significant regulatory assets and liabilities have been recorded. Management reviews the ultimate recoverability of these regulatory assets and any requirement to refund these regulatory liabilities based on applicable regulatory guidelines and GAAP. However, adverse II-142 Table of Contents Index to Financial StatementsMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Mississippi Power Company 2018 Annual Reportlegislative, judicial, or regulatory actions could materially impact the amounts of such regulatory assets and liabilities and could adversely impact Mississippi Power's financial statements.Kemper County Energy Facility Closure CostsFor periods prior to the second quarter 2017, significant accounting estimates included Kemper County energy facility estimated construction costs, project completion date, and rate recovery. In the aggregate, Mississippi Power had recorded charges to income of $3.07 billion ($1.89 billion after tax) as a result of changes in the cost estimate above the cost cap for the Kemper IGCC through May 31, 2017, of which $305 million ($188 million after tax) occurred in 2017 and $428 million ($264 million after tax) occurred in 2016.On June 21, 2017, the Mississippi PSC stated its intent to issue an order (which occurred on July 6, 2017) directing Mississippi Power to pursue a settlement under which the Kemper County energy facility would be operated as a natural gas plant rather than an IGCC plant; therefore, Mississippi Power suspended the operation and start-up of the gasifier portion of the Kemper County energy facility on June 28, 2017. As a result of these events, cost recovery of the gasification portions became no longer probable; therefore, Mississippi Power recorded an additional charge to income in June 2017 of $2.8 billion ($2.0 billion after tax), which included estimated costs associated with the gasification portions of the plant and lignite mine. During the third and fourth quarters of 2017, Mississippi Power recorded charges to income of $242 million ($206 million after tax), including $164 million for ongoing project costs, estimated mine and gasifier-related costs, and certain termination costs during the suspension period prior to conclusion of the Kemper Settlement Docket, as well as a charge of $78 million associated with the Kemper Settlement Agreement. The estimated construction costs and project completion date were no longer considered significant accounting estimates for 2017 following the suspension and related charges to earnings. In addition, the Kemper Settlement Agreement was approved by the Mississippi PSC on February 6, 2018 and resolved all related cost recovery issues.In 2018, Mississippi Power recorded pre-tax charges to income of $37 million ($27 million after tax), primarily resulting from the abandonment and related closure activities and ongoing period costs, net of sales proceeds, for the mine and gasifier-related assets at the Kemper County energy facility. Additional closure costs for the mine and gasifier-related assets, currently estimated at up to $10 million pre-tax (excluding salvage, net of dismantlement costs), may be incurred through the first half of 2020. During the fourth quarter 2018, Mississippi Power began evaluating its options regarding the final disposition of the CO2 pipeline, including removal of the pipeline. This evaluation is expected to be complete later in 2019. If Mississippi Power ultimately decides to remove the CO2 pipeline, the cost of removal would have a material impact on Mississippi Power's financial statements. In addition, in December 2018, Mississippi Power filed with the DOE its request for property closeout certification under the contract related to the grants received. Mississippi Power and the DOE are currently in discussions regarding the requested closeout and property disposition, which may require payment to the DOE for a portion of certain property that is to be retained by Mississippi Power and could have a material impact on Mississippi Power's financial statements. Given the significant judgment and uncertainty involved in estimating these remaining costs associated with the abandonment and closure activities for the mine and gasifier-related assets at the Kemper County energy facility, Mississippi Power considers the related liabilities to be critical accounting estimates.See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Kemper County Energy Facility"" for additional information. The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.Asset Retirement ObligationsAROs are computed as the fair value of the estimated costs for an asset's future retirement and are recorded in the period in which the liability is incurred. The estimated costs are capitalized as part of the related long-lived asset and depreciated over the asset's useful life. In the absence of quoted market prices, AROs are estimated using present value techniques in which estimates of future cash outlays associated with the asset retirements are discounted using a credit-adjusted risk-free rate. Estimates of the timing and amounts of future cash outlays are based on projections of when and how the assets will be retired and the cost of future removal activities.The liability for AROs primarily relates to facilities that are subject to the CCR Rule, principally ash ponds. In addition, Mississippi Power has AROs related to various landfill sites, underground storage tanks, water wells, mine reclamation, and asbestos removal.Mississippi Power also has identified retirement obligations related to certain transmission and distribution facilities and certain wireless communication towers. However, liabilities for the removal of these assets have not been recorded because the settlement timing for the retirement obligations related to these assets is indeterminable and, therefore, the fair value of the retirement obligations cannot be reasonably estimated. A liability for these retirement obligations will be recognized when sufficient II-143 Table of Contents Index to Financial StatementsMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Mississippi Power Company 2018 Annual Reportinformation becomes available to support a reasonable estimation of the retirement obligation. In 2018, Mississippi Power incurred $16 million in ARO revisions, including $11 million at Plant Greene County, which is co-owned with Alabama Power. The cost estimates for AROs related to the disposal of CCR are based on information using various assumptions related to closure and post-closure costs, timing of future cash outlays, inflation and discount rates, and the potential methods for complying with the CCR Rule requirements for closure. Mississippi Power expects to periodically update its ARO cost estimates. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – ""Environmental Matters – Environmental Laws and Regulations – Coal Combustion Residuals"" herein and Note 6 to the financial statements for additional information.Given the significant judgment involved in estimating AROs, Mississippi Power considers the liabilities for AROs to be critical accounting estimates.Pension and Other Postretirement BenefitsMississippi Power's calculation of pension and other postretirement benefits expense is dependent on a number of assumptions. These assumptions include discount rates, healthcare cost trend rates, expected long-term return on plan assets, mortality rates, expected salary and wage increases, and other factors. Components of pension and other postretirement benefits expense include interest and service cost on the pension and other postretirement benefit plans, expected return on plan assets, and amortization of certain unrecognized costs and obligations. Actual results that differ from the assumptions utilized are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, generally affect recognized expense and the recorded obligation in future periods. While Mississippi Power believes that the assumptions used are appropriate, differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions would affect its pension and other postretirement benefit costs and obligations.Key elements in determining Mississippi Power's pension and other postretirement benefit expense are the expected long-term return on plan assets and the discount rate used to measure the benefit plan obligations and the periodic benefit plan expense for future periods. The expected long-term return on pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets is based on Southern Company's investment strategy, historical experience, and expectations for long-term rates of return that consider external actuarial advice. Southern Company determines the long-term return on plan assets by applying the long-term rate of expected returns on various asset classes to Southern Company's target asset allocation. For purposes of determining Mississippi Power's liability related to the pension and other postretirement benefit plans, Southern Company discounts the future related cash flows using a single-point discount rate developed from the weighted average of market-observed yields for high quality fixed income securities with maturities that correspond to expected benefit payments.A 25 basis point change in any significant assumption (discount rate, salary increases, or long-term rate of return on plan assets) would result in a $1 million or less change in total annual benefit expense, a $19 million or less change in the projected obligation for the pension plan, and a $2 million or less change in the projected obligation for other post retirement benefit plans.See Note 11 to the financial statements for additional information regarding pension and other postretirement benefits.Contingent ObligationsMississippi Power is subject to a number of federal and state laws and regulations as well as other factors and conditions that subject it to environmental, litigation, and other risks. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL herein and Notes 2 and 3 to the financial statements for more information regarding certain of these contingencies. Mississippi Power periodically evaluates its exposure to such risks and records reserves for those matters where a non-tax-related loss is considered probable and reasonably estimable. The adequacy of reserves can be significantly affected by external events or conditions that can be unpredictable; thus, the ultimate outcome of such matters could materially affect Mississippi Power's results of operations, cash flows, or financial condition.Recently Issued Accounting StandardsSee Note 1 to the financial statements under ""Recently Adopted Accounting Standards"" for additional information.In 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) (ASU 2016-02). ASU 2016-02 requires lessees to recognize on the balance sheet a lease liability and a right-of-use asset for all leases. ASU 2016-02 also changes the recognition, measurement, and presentation of expense associated with leases and provides clarification regarding the identification of certain components of contracts that would represent a lease. The accounting required by lessors is relatively unchanged. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 and Mississippi Power adopted the new standard effective January 1, 2019.Mississippi Power elected the transition methodology provided by ASU No. 2018-11, Leases (Topic 842): Targeted Improvements, whereby the requirements of ASU 2016-02 are applied on a prospective basis as of the adoption date of January 1, 2019, without restating prior periods. Mississippi Power elected the package of practical expedients provided by ASU 2016-02 II-144 Table of Contents Index to Financial StatementsMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Mississippi Power Company 2018 Annual Reportthat allows prior determinations of whether existing contracts are, or contain, leases and the classification of existing leases to continue without reassessment. Additionally, Mississippi Power applied the use-of-hindsight practical expedient in determining lease terms as of the date of adoption and elected the practical expedient that allows existing land easements not previously accounted for as leases not to be reassessed. Mississippi Power also made accounting policy elections to account for short-term leases in all asset classes as off-balance sheet leases and combined lease and non-lease components in the computations of lease obligations and right-of-use assets for most asset classes.Mississippi Power completed the implementation of a new application to track and account for its leases and updated its internal controls and accounting policies to support the accounting for leases under ASU 2016-02. Mississippi Power completed its lease inventory and determined its most significant leases involve equipment and railcar leases. In the first quarter 2019, adoption of ASU 2016-02 did not have a material impact on Mississippi Power's balance sheet or statement of income.FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITYOverviewEarnings for all periods presented were negatively affected by charges associated with the Kemper IGCC. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – ""Kemper County Energy Facility"" herein and Note 2 to the financial statements for additional information.Mississippi Power's financial condition remained stable at December 31, 2018. Mississippi Power's cash requirements primarily consist of funding ongoing operations, common stock dividends, capital expenditures, and debt maturities. Capital expenditures and other investing activities include investments to maintain existing generation facilities, to comply with environmental regulations including adding environmental modifications to certain existing generating units and closures of ash ponds, to expand and improve transmission and distribution facilities, and for restoration following major storms. Operating cash flows provide a substantial portion of Mississippi Power's cash needs. For the three-year period from 2019 through 2021, Mississippi Power's projected common stock dividends, capital expenditures, and debt maturities are expected to exceed operating cash flows. Mississippi Power plans to finance future cash needs in excess of its operating cash flows primarily through external securities issuances, borrowings from financial institutions, including commercial paper to the extent Mississippi Power is eligible to participate, and equity contributions from Southern Company. Mississippi Power intends to continue to monitor its access to short-term and long-term capital markets as well as its bank credit arrangements to meet future capital and liquidity needs. See ""Sources of Capital,"" ""Financing Activities,"" and ""Capital Requirements and Contractual Obligations"" herein for additional information.Mississippi Power's investments in the qualified pension plan decreased in value as of December 31, 2018 as compared to December 31, 2017. No contributions to the qualified pension plan were made for the year ended December 31, 2018 and no mandatory contributions to the qualified pension plan are anticipated during 2019. See Note 11 to the financial statements under ""Pension Plans"" for additional information.Net cash provided from operating activities totaled $804 million for 2018, an increase of $301 million as compared to 2017. The increase in cash provided from operating activities in 2018 was primarily related to increased income tax refunds in 2018 primarily related to the tax abandonment of the Kemper IGCC. Net cash provided from operating activities totaled $503 million for 2017, an increase of $274 million as compared to 2016. The increase in cash provided from operating activities in 2017 was primarily due to tax refunds associated with the Section 174 R&E settlement, largely offset by a decrease in income taxes related to the Kemper County energy facility and the Tax Reform Legislation.Net cash used for investing activities in 2018, 2017, and 2016 totaled $232 million, $504 million, and $697 million, respectively. The cash used for investing activities in 2018 was primarily due to gross property additions related to other production, distribution, transmission, and steam production. The cash used for investing activities in 2017 and 2016 was primarily due to gross property additions related to the Kemper County energy facility. The cash used for investing activities in 2016 was partially offset by the receipt of Additional DOE Grants. Net cash used for financing activities totaled $527 million in 2018 primarily due to redemption of preferred stock, long-term debt, short-term borrowings, and senior notes, partially offset by the issuance of senior notes and short-term borrowings. Net cash provided from financing activities totaled $25 million in 2017 primarily from capital contributions from Southern Company, largely offset by redemptions of long-term debt and short-term borrowings. Net cash provided from financing activities totaled $594 million in 2016 primarily due to long-term debt financings and capital contributions from Southern Company, partially offset by a decrease in short-term borrowings and redemptions of long-term debt.Significant balance sheet changes in 2018 included increases of $442 million in long-term debt primarily due to the issuance of senior notes, a net change of $475 million in accumulated deferred income taxes primarily due to the tax abandonment of the II-145 Table of Contents Index to Financial StatementsMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Mississippi Power Company 2018 Annual ReportKemper IGCC, and a decrease of $949 million in securities due within one year primarily due to the repayment of a $900 million unsecured term loan. See ""Financing Activities"" herein and Notes 8 and 10 to the financial statements for additional information.Mississippi Power's ratio of common equity to total capitalization plus short-term debt was 50% and 39% at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increase was primarily due to repayment of debt obligations in 2018. See Note 8 to the financial statements for additional information.Sources of CapitalMississippi Power plans to obtain the funds to meet its future capital needs from operating cash flows, external securities issuances, borrowings from financial institutions, including commercial paper to the extent Mississippi Power is eligible to participate, and equity contributions from Southern Company. However, the amount, type, and timing of any future financing, if needed, will depend upon prevailing market conditions, regulatory approval, and other factors.The issuance of securities by Mississippi Power is subject to regulatory approval by the FERC. Additionally, with respect to the public offering of securities, Mississippi Power files registration statements with the SEC under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The amounts of securities authorized by the FERC, as well as the securities registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, are continuously monitored and appropriate filings are made to ensure flexibility in raising capital. Any future financing through secured debt would also require approval by the Mississippi PSC.Mississippi Power obtains financing separately without credit support from any affiliate. See Note 8 to the financial statements under ""Bank Credit Arrangements"" for additional information. The Southern Company system does not maintain a centralized cash or money pool. Therefore, funds of Mississippi Power are not commingled with funds of any other company in the Southern Company system.Mississippi Power's current liabilities sometimes exceed current assets because of long-term debt maturities and the periodic use of short-term debt as a funding source, as well as significant seasonal fluctuations in cash needs. At December 31, 2018, Mississippi Power had approximately $293 million of cash and cash equivalents. Committed credit arrangements with banks at December 31, 2018 were $100 million, all of which is unused. In October 2018, Mississippi Power amended its one-year credit arrangements in an aggregate amount of $100 million to extend the maturity dates from 2018 to 2019.See Note 8 to the financial statements under ""Bank Credit Arrangements"" for additional information.All of these bank credit arrangements contain covenants that limit debt levels and typically contain cross acceleration provisions to other indebtedness (including guarantee obligations) of Mississippi Power. Such cross-acceleration provisions to other indebtedness would trigger an event of default if Mississippi Power defaulted on indebtedness, the payment of which was then accelerated. At December 31, 2018, Mississippi Power was in compliance with all such covenants. None of the bank credit arrangements contain material adverse change clauses at the time of borrowing.Subject to applicable market conditions, Mississippi Power expects to renew or replace its credit arrangements as needed, prior to expiration. In connection therewith, Mississippi Power may extend the maturity dates and/or increase or decrease the lending commitments thereunder.A portion of the $100 million unused credit arrangements with banks is allocated to provide liquidity support to Mississippi Power's revenue bonds. The amount of variable rate revenue bonds outstanding requiring liquidity support at December 31, 2018 was approximately $40 million. Short-term borrowings are included in notes payable in the balance sheets. Details of short-term borrowing were as follows: Short-term Debt at the End of the Period Short-term Debt During the Period (*) Amount Outstanding Weighted Average Interest Rate Average Outstanding Weighted Average Interest Rate Maximum Amount Outstanding (in millions) (in millions) (in millions)December 31, 2018$— —% $68 2.0% $300December 31, 2017$4 3.8% $18 3.0% $36December 31, 2016$23 2.6% $112 2.0% $500(*)Average and maximum amounts are based upon daily balances during the 12-month periods ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016. II-146 Table of Contents Index to Financial StatementsMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Mississippi Power Company 2018 Annual ReportMississippi Power believes the need for working capital can be adequately met by utilizing lines of credit, short-term bank notes, commercial paper to the extent Mississippi Power is eligible to participate, and operating cash flows.Financing ActivitiesIn March 2018, Mississippi Power issued $300 million aggregate principal amount of Series 2018A Floating Rate Senior Notes due March 27, 2020 bearing interest based on three-month LIBOR and $300 million aggregate principal amount of Series 2018B 3.95% Senior Notes due March 30, 2028. In March 2018, Mississippi Power also entered into a $300 million short-term floating rate bank loan bearing interest based on one-month LIBOR, of which $200 million was repaid in the second quarter 2018 and $100 million was repaid in the third quarter 2018. Mississippi Power used the proceeds from these financings to repay a $900 million unsecured floating rate term loan.In July 2018, Mississippi Power purchased and held approximately $43 million aggregate principal amount of Mississippi Business Finance Corporation Pollution Control Revenue Refunding Bonds, Series 2002. Mississippi Power may reoffer these bonds to the public at a later date.In October 2018, Mississippi Power completed the redemption of all 334,210 outstanding shares of its preferred stock (as well as related depositary shares), with an aggregate par value of approximately $33.4 million; all $30 million aggregate principal amount outstanding of its Series G 5.40% Senior Notes due July 1, 2035; and all $125 million aggregate principal amount outstanding of its Series 2009A 5.55% Senior Notes due March 1, 2019.In December 2018, Southern Company made equity contributions totaling $17 million to Mississippi Power.In addition to any financings that may be necessary to meet capital requirements and contractual obligations, Mississippi Power plans, when economically feasible, to retire higher-cost securities and replace these obligations with lower-cost capital if market conditions permit.Credit Rating RiskAt December 31, 2018, Mississippi Power does not have any credit arrangements that would require material changes in payment schedules or terminations as a result of a credit rating downgrade. On October 2, 2018, the Mississippi PSC approved executed agreements between Mississippi Power and its largest retail customer, Chevron, for Mississippi Power to continue providing retail service to the Chevron refinery in Pascagoula, Mississippi through 2038. The agreements grant Chevron a security interest in the co-generation assets, with a net book value of approximately $101 million at December 31, 2018, located at the refinery that is exercisable upon the occurrence of (i) certain bankruptcy events or (ii) other events of default coupled with specific reductions in steam output at the facility and a downgrade of Mississippi Power's credit rating to below investment grade by two of the three rating agencies.There are certain contracts that have required or could require collateral, but not accelerated payment, in the event of a credit rating change to BBB and/or Baa2 or below. These contracts are for physical electricity purchases and sales, fuel transportation and storage, energy price risk management, and transmission. At December 31, 2018, the maximum potential collateral requirements at a rating below BBB- and/or Baa3 equaled approximately $283 million.Included in these amounts are certain agreements that could require collateral in the event that either Alabama Power or Georgia Power (affiliate companies of Mississippi Power) has a credit rating change to below investment grade. Generally, collateral may be provided by a Southern Company guaranty, letter of credit, or cash. Additionally, a credit rating downgrade could impact the ability of Mississippi Power to access capital markets and would be likely to impact the cost at which it does so.On February 26, 2018, Moody's revised its rating outlook for Mississippi Power from stable to positive. On August 8, 2018, Moody's upgraded Mississippi Power's senior unsecured rating to Baa3 from Ba1 and maintained the positive rating outlook.On February 28, 2018, Fitch removed Mississippi Power from rating watch negative and revised its rating outlook from stable to positive.On March 14, 2018, S&P upgraded the senior unsecured long-term debt rating of Mississippi Power to A- from BBB+. The outlook remained negative.As a result of the Tax Reform Legislation, certain financial metrics, such as the funds from operations to debt percentage, used by the credit rating agencies to assess Southern Company and its subsidiaries, including Mississippi Power, may be negatively impacted. The PEP Settlement Agreement is expected to help mitigate these potential adverse impacts by allowing Mississippi Power to retain the excess deferred taxes resulting from the Tax Reform Legislation until the conclusion of the Mississippi Power 2019 Base Rate Case. In addition, Mississippi Power has committed to seek equity contributions sufficient to restore its equity ratio to the 50% target. See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Mississippi Power"" for additional information.II-147 Table of Contents Index to Financial StatementsMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Mississippi Power Company 2018 Annual ReportMarket Price RiskDue to cost-based rate regulation and other various cost recovery mechanisms, Mississippi Power continues to have limited exposure to market volatility in interest rates, commodity fuel prices, and prices of electricity. To manage the volatility attributable to these exposures, Mississippi Power nets the exposures, where possible, to take advantage of natural offsets and enters into various derivative transactions for the remaining exposures pursuant to Mississippi Power's policies in areas such as counterparty exposure and risk management practices. Mississippi Power's policy is that derivatives are to be used primarily for hedging purposes and mandates strict adherence to all applicable risk management policies. Derivative positions are monitored using techniques that include, but are not limited to, market valuation, value at risk, stress testing, and sensitivity analysis.To mitigate future exposure to a change in interest rates, Mississippi Power may enter into derivatives that have been designated as hedges. The weighted average interest rate on $340 million of long-term variable interest rate exposure at December 31, 2018 was 3.32%. If Mississippi Power sustained a 100 basis point change in interest rates for all long-term variable interest rate exposure, the change would have an immaterial effect on annualized interest expense at December 31, 2018. See Note 1 to the financial statements under ""Financial Instruments"" and Note 14 to the financial statements for additional information.To mitigate residual risks relative to movements in electricity prices, Mississippi Power enters into physical fixed-price contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity through the wholesale electricity market and, to a lesser extent, financial hedge contracts for natural gas purchases. Mississippi Power continues to manage retail fuel-hedging programs implemented per the guidelines of the Mississippi PSC and wholesale fuel-hedging programs under agreements with wholesale customers. Mississippi Power had no material change in market risk exposure for the year ended December 31, 2018 when compared to the year ended December 31, 2017.The changes in fair value of energy-related derivative contracts are substantially attributable to both the volume and the price of natural gas. For the years ended December 31, the changes in fair value of energy-related derivative contracts, the majority of which are composed of regulatory hedges, were as follows: 2018Changes 2017Changes Fair Value (in millions)Contracts outstanding at the beginning of the period, assets (liabilities), net$(7) $(7)Contracts realized or settled3 8Current period changes(*)(2) (8)Contracts outstanding at the end of the period, assets (liabilities), net$(6) $(7)(*)Current period changes also include the changes in fair value of new contracts entered into during the period, if any.The net hedge volumes of energy-related derivative contracts at December 31, 2018 and 2017 were as follows: 2018 2017 mmBtu Volume (in millions)Natural gas options3 —Natural gas swaps60 53Total hedge volume63 53For natural gas hedges, the weighted average swap contract cost above market prices was approximately $0.10 per mmBtu at December 31, 2018 and $0.14 per mmBtu at December 31, 2017. The options outstanding were immaterial for the reporting periods presented. The costs associated with natural gas hedges are recovered through Mississippi Power's ECM clause.At December 31, 2018 and 2017, substantially all of Mississippi Power's energy-related derivative contracts were designated as regulatory hedges and were related to Mississippi Power's fuel-hedging program. Therefore, gains and losses are initially recorded as regulatory liabilities and assets, respectively, and then are included in fuel expense as they are recovered through the ECM clause. II-148 Table of Contents Index to Financial StatementsMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Mississippi Power Company 2018 Annual ReportMississippi Power uses over-the-counter contracts that are not exchange traded but are fair valued using prices which are market observable, and thus fall into Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. See Note 13 to the financial statements for further discussion of fair value measurements. The maturities of the energy-related derivative contracts, which are all Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, at December 31, 2018 were as follows: Fair Value MeasurementsDecember 31, 2018 Total Maturity Fair Value Year 1 Years 2&3 (in millions)Level 1$— $— $—Level 2(6) (2) (4)Level 3— — —Fair value of contracts outstanding at end of period$(6) $(2) $(4)Mississippi Power is exposed to market price risk in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to the energy-related derivative contracts. Mississippi Power only enters into agreements and material transactions with counterparties that have investment grade credit ratings by Moody's and S&P or with counterparties who have posted collateral to cover potential credit exposure. Therefore, Mississippi Power does not anticipate market risk exposure from nonperformance by the counterparties. For additional information, see Note 1 to the financial statements under ""Financial Instruments"" and Note 14 to the financial statements.Capital Requirements and Contractual ObligationsThe construction program of Mississippi Power is currently estimated to total $222 million for 2019, $230 million for 2020, $216 million for 2021, $220 million for 2022, and $184 million for 2023. The construction program includes capital expenditures covered under LTSAs. Estimated capital expenditures to comply with environmental laws and regulations included in these amounts are $18 million, $20 million, $17 million, $5 million, and $13 million for 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023, respectively. These estimated expenditures do not include any potential compliance costs associated with pending regulation of CO2 emissions from fossil fuel-fired electric generating units. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – ""Environmental Matters – Environmental Laws and Regulations"" and ""– Global Climate Issues"" herein for additional information.Mississippi Power also anticipates costs associated with closure and monitoring of ash ponds in accordance with the CCR Rule, which are reflected in Mississippi Power's ARO liabilities. These costs, which are expected to change and could change materially as underlying assumptions are refined and the cost and the method and timing of compliance activities continue to be evaluated, are currently estimated to be $9 million, $9 million, $12 million, $14 million, and $15 million for the years 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023, respectively. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – ""Environmental Matters – Environmental Laws and Regulations – Coal Combustion Residuals"" herein and Note 6 to the financial statements for additional information.The construction program is subject to periodic review and revision, and actual construction costs may vary from these estimates because of numerous factors. These factors include: changes in business conditions; changes in load projections; storm impacts; changes in environmental laws and regulations; the outcome of any legal challenges to environmental rules; changes in generating plants, including unit retirements and replacements and adding or changing fuel sources at existing electric generating units, to meet regulatory requirements; changes in FERC rules and regulations; Mississippi PSC approvals; changes in the expected environmental compliance program; changes in legislation; the cost and efficiency of construction labor, equipment, and materials; project scope and design changes; and the cost of capital. In addition, there can be no assurance that costs related to capital expenditures will be fully recovered.In addition, as discussed in Note 11 to the financial statements, Mississippi Power provides postretirement benefits to substantially all employees and funds trusts to the extent required by the FERC.Funding requirements related to obligations associated with scheduled maturities of long-term debt, as well as the related interest, derivative obligations, pension and other post-retirement benefit plans, leases, other purchase commitments, and ARO settlements are detailed in the contractual obligations table that follows. See Notes 1, 6, 8, 9, 11, and 14 to the financial statements for additional information.II-149 Table of Contents Index to Financial StatementsMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Mississippi Power Company 2018 Annual ReportContractual ObligationsContractual obligations at December 31, 2018 were as follows: 2019 2020-2021 2022-2023 After2023 Total (in millions)Long-term debt(a) — Principal$— $577 $— $983 $1,560Interest70 130 80 577 857Financial derivative obligations(b)3 5 — — 8Operating leases(c)3 3 2 2 10Purchase commitments — Capital(d)222 410 352 — 984Fuel(e)378 368 199 136 1,081Long-term service agreements(f)27 57 70 250 404Purchased power(g)11 35 36 435 517ARO settlements(h)9 21 29 — 59Pension and other postretirement benefits plans(i)8 15 — — 23Total$731 $1,621 $768 $2,383 $5,503(a)All amounts are reflected based on final maturity dates. Mississippi Power plans to continue, when economically feasible, to retire higher-cost securities and replace these obligations with lower-cost capital if market conditions permit. Variable rate interest obligations are estimated based on rates at December 31, 2018, as reflected in the statements of capitalization. Fixed rates include, where applicable, the effects of interest rate derivatives employed to manage interest rate risk. For additional information, see Note 8 to the financial statements.(b)Derivative obligations are for energy-related derivatives. For additional information, see Notes 1 and 14 to the financial statements.(c)See Note 9 to the financial statements for additional information.(d)Mississippi Power provides estimated capital expenditures for a five-year period, including capital expenditures associated with environmental regulations. At December 31, 2018, significant purchase commitments were outstanding in connection with the construction program. These amounts exclude capital expenditures covered under LTSAs and estimated capital expenditures for AROs, which are reflected separately. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – ""Environmental Matters"" for additional information.(e)Includes commitments to purchase coal and natural gas, as well as the related transportation and storage. In most cases, these contracts contain provisions for price escalation, minimum purchase levels, and other financial commitments. Natural gas purchase commitments are based on various indices at the time of delivery. Amounts reflected for natural gas purchase commitments have been estimated based on the NYMEX future prices at December 31, 2018.(f)LTSAs include price escalation based on inflation indices.(g)Estimated minimum long-term commitments for the purchase of solar energy. Energy costs associated with solar PPAs are recovered through the fuel clause. See Notes 2 and 9 to the financial statements for additional information.(h)Represents estimated costs for a five-year period associated with closing and monitoring ash ponds in accordance with the CCR Rule, which are reflected in Mississippi Power's ARO liabilities. Material expenditures in future years for ARO settlements also will be required for ash ponds and other liabilities reflected in Mississippi Power's AROs. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – ""Environmental Matters – Environmental Laws and Regulations – Coal Combustion Residuals"" herein and Note 6 to the financial statements for additional information.(i)Mississippi Power forecasts contributions to the pension and other postretirement benefit plans over a three-year period. Mississippi Power anticipates no mandatory contributions to the qualified pension plan during the next three years. Amounts presented represent estimated benefit payments for the nonqualified pension plans, estimated non-trust benefit payments for the other postretirement benefit plans, and estimated contributions to the other postretirement benefit plan trusts, all of which will be made from Mississippi Power's corporate assets. See Note 11 to the financial statements for additional information related to the pension and other postretirement benefit plans, including estimated benefit payments. Certain benefit payments will be made through the related benefit plans. Other benefit payments will be made from Mississippi Power's corporate assets.II-150 Table of Contents Index to Financial StatementsMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSSouthern Power Company and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual ReportOVERVIEWBusiness ActivitiesSouthern Power develops, constructs, acquires, owns, and manages power generation assets, including renewable energy projects, and sells electricity at market-based rates in the wholesale market. Southern Power continually seeks opportunities to execute its strategy to create value through various transactions including acquisitions, dispositions, and sales of partnership interests, development and construction of new generating facilities, and entry into PPAs primarily with investor-owned utilities, IPPs, municipalities, electric cooperatives, and other load-serving entities, as well as commercial and industrial customers. In general, Southern Power commits to the construction or acquisition of new generating capacity only after entering into or assuming long-term PPAs for the new facilities.During 2018, Southern Power acquired and placed in service the 20-MW Gaskell West 1 solar facility, placed in service the 148-MW Cactus Flats wind facility, acquired and began construction of the 100-MW Wild Horse Mountain and the 200-MW Reading wind facilities, and continued construction of the expansion of the 385-MW Mankato natural gas facility. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – ""Acquisitions"" and ""Construction Projects"" herein for additional information.Also during 2018, Southern Power completed the following sales of noncontrolling interests and sales of assets resulting in approximately $2.6 billion in proceeds: •On May 22, 2018, Southern Power sold a noncontrolling 33% equity interest in SP Solar, a limited partnership indirectly owning substantially all of Southern Power's solar facilities, for approximately $1.2 billion. •On December 4, 2018, Southern Power sold all of its equity interests in Plant Oleander and Plant Stanton Unit A (together, the Florida Plants) to NextEra Energy for $203 million. •On December 11, 2018, Southern Power sold a noncontrolling tax equity interest in SP Wind, a holding company owning a portfolio of eight operating wind facilities, for approximately $1.2 billion. In addition, on November 5, 2018, Southern Power entered into an agreement to sell all of its equity interests in Plant Mankato (including the 385-MW expansion currently under construction) for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $650 million. The completion of the disposition is subject to the expansion unit reaching commercial operation as well as various other customary conditions to closing, including FERC and state commission approvals, and the sale is expected to close mid-2019. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.At December 31, 2018, Southern Power's generation fleet, which is owned in part with its various partners, totaled 11,888 MWs of nameplate capacity in commercial operation (including 4,508 MWs of nameplate capacity owned by its subsidiaries and including Plant Mankato, which is classified as held for sale in the financial statements). The average remaining duration of Southern Power's total portfolio of wholesale contracts is approximately 14 years, which reduces remarketing risk for Southern Power. With the inclusion of the PPAs and investments associated with renewable and natural gas facilities currently under construction, Southern Power has an average investment coverage ratio, at December 31, 2018, of 93% through 2023 and 91% through 2028 (including Plant Mankato, which is classified as held for sale in the financial statements).Southern Power's future earnings will be materially decreased as a result of the asset and non-controlling interest sales described above. In addition, Southern Power's future earnings will depend on the parameters of the wholesale market and the efficient operation of its wholesale generating assets, as well as Southern Power's ability to execute its growth strategy and to develop and construct generating facilities. In addition, Southern Power's future earnings may be impacted by the availability of federal and state solar ITCs and wind PTCs on its renewable energy projects, which could be impacted by future tax legislation. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – ""General,"" ""Acquisitions,"" ""Construction Projects,"" and ""Income Tax Matters"" herein and Notes 10 and 15 to the financial statements for additional information.To evaluate operating results and to ensure Southern Power's ability to meet its contractual commitments to customers, Southern Power continues to focus on several key performance indicators, including, but not limited to, peak season equivalent forced outage rate, contract availability, and net income.See RESULTS OF OPERATIONS herein for information on Southern Power's financial performance.EarningsSouthern Power's 2018 net income was $187 million, an $884 million decrease from 2017, primarily attributable to $743 million of tax benefits recognized in 2017 and $79 million in tax expense recognized in 2018, both related to the Tax Reform Legislation. Also contributing to the decrease were asset impairment charges in 2018 totaling $156 million ($120 million pre-tax for the II-151 Table of Contents Index to Financial StatementsMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Power Company and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual ReportFlorida Plants and $36 million pre-tax for turbine equipment held for development projects, which together totaled $117 million after tax), partially offset by approximately $65 million in state income tax benefits arising from reorganizations of legal entities that own and operate certain of Southern Power's solar and wind facilities.Southern Power's 2017 net income was $1.1 billion, a $733 million increase from 2016, primarily attributable to $743 million in tax benefits recognized in 2017 related to the Tax Reform Legislation. Also contributing to the change were increases in operating expenses and interest expense related to Southern Power's growth strategy and continuous construction program, largely offset by increased renewable energy sales.In addition, tax benefits from wind PTCs significantly impacted Southern Power's net income in 2018 and 2017. Tax benefits from solar ITCs related to the acquisition and construction of new facilities also significantly impacted Southern Power's net income in 2017 and 2016. See Note 10 to the financial statements under ""Effective Tax Rate"" for additional information.RESULTS OF OPERATIONSA condensed statement of income follows: Amount Increase (Decrease)from Prior Year 2018 2018 2017 (in millions)Operating revenues$2,205 $130 $498Fuel699 78 165Purchased power176 27 47Other operations and maintenance395 9 32Depreciation and amortization493 (10) 151Taxes other than income taxes46 (2) 25Asset impairment156 156 —Gain on disposition(2) (2) —Total operating expenses1,963 256 420Operating income242 (126) 78Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized183 (8) 74Other income (expense), net23 22 (5)Income taxes (benefit)(164) 775 (744)Net income246 (871) 743Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests59 13 10Net income attributable to Southern Power$187 $(884) $733Operating RevenuesTotal operating revenues include PPA capacity revenues, which are derived primarily from long-term contracts involving natural gas and biomass generating facilities, and PPA energy revenues from Southern Power's generation facilities. To the extent Southern Power has capacity not contracted under a PPA, it may sell power into an accessible wholesale market, or, to the extent those generation assets are part of the FERC-approved IIC, it may sell power into the power pool.Natural Gas and Biomass Capacity and Energy RevenueCapacity revenues generally represent the greatest contribution to operating income and are designed to provide recovery of fixed costs plus a return on investment.Energy is generally sold at variable cost or is indexed to published natural gas indices. Energy revenues will vary depending on the energy demand of Southern Power's customers and their generation capacity, as well as the market prices of wholesale energy compared to the cost of Southern Power's energy. Energy revenues also include fees for support services, fuel storage, and unit start charges. Increases and decreases in energy revenues under PPAs that are driven by fuel or purchased power prices are accompanied by an increase or decrease in fuel and purchased power costs and do not have a significant impact on net income.II-152 Table of Contents Index to Financial StatementsMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Power Company and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual ReportSolar and Wind Energy RevenueSouthern Power's energy sales from solar and wind generating facilities are predominantly through long-term PPAs that do not have a capacity charge. Customers either purchase the energy output of a dedicated renewable facility through an energy charge or pay a fixed price related to the energy generated from the respective facility and sold to the grid. As a result, Southern Power's ability to recover fixed and variable operations and maintenance expenses is dependent upon the level of energy generated from these facilities, which can be impacted by weather conditions, equipment performance, transmission constraints, and other factors. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – ""Power Sales Agreements"" herein for additional information regarding Southern Power's PPAs.Details of Southern Power's operating revenues were as follows: 2018 2017 2016 (in millions) PPA capacity revenues $580 $599 $541PPA energy revenues 1,140 970 694Total PPA revenues1,720 1,569 1,235Non-PPA revenues 472 494 330Other revenues13 12 12Total operating revenues$2,205 $2,075 $1,577Operating revenues for 2018 were $2.2 billion, reflecting a $130 million, or 6%, increase from 2017. The increase in operating revenues was primarily due to the following:•PPA capacity revenues decreased $19 million, or 3%, primarily due to decreases of $16 million from the contractual expiration of an affiliate natural gas PPA and $5 million from the Florida Plants sold in December 2018.•PPA energy revenues increased $170 million, or 18%, primarily due to a $142 million increase in sales related to existing natural gas facilities driven by an $88 million increase in the average cost of fuel and a $54 million increase in the volume of KWHs sold due to customer load, a $12 million increase related to PPAs associated with new renewable facilities, and a $16 million increase related to PPAs associated with existing renewable facilities primarily due to an increase in the volume of KWHs sold.•Non-PPA revenues decreased $22 million, or 4%, primarily due to a $56 million decrease in the volume of KWHs sold from uncovered natural gas capacity through short-term sales, partially offset by a $35 million increase in the market price of energy.Operating revenues for 2017 were $2.1 billion, reflecting a $498 million, or 32%, increase from 2016. The increase in operating revenues was primarily due to the following:•PPA capacity revenues increased $58 million, or 11%, primarily due to additional customer capacity requirements and a new PPA related to Plant Mankato acquired in late 2016.•PPA energy revenues increased $276 million, or 40%, primarily due to a $213 million increase in renewable energy sales arising from new solar and wind facilities and a $50 million increase in sales related to existing natural gas PPAs primarily due to an $85 million increase in the average cost of fuel, partially offset by a $35 million decrease in the volume of KWHs sold primarily due to reduced customer load.•Non-PPA revenues increased $164 million, or 50%, primarily due to a $156 million increase in the volume of KWHs sold primarily from uncovered natural gas capacity through short-term opportunity sales, as well as an $8 million increase in the market price of energy.II-153 Table of Contents Index to Financial StatementsMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Power Company and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual ReportFuel and Purchased Power ExpensesDetails of Southern Power's generation and purchased power were as follows: TotalKWHsTotal KWH % ChangeTotalKWHsTotal KWH % Change 2018 2017 (in billions of KWHs)Generation46 44 Purchased power4 5 Total generation and purchased power502%4923%Total generation and purchased power, excluding solar, wind, and tolling agreements294%2822%Southern Power's PPAs for natural gas and biomass generation generally provide that the purchasers are responsible for either procuring the fuel (tolling agreements) or reimbursing Southern Power for substantially all of the cost of fuel relating to the energy delivered under such PPAs. Consequently, changes in such fuel costs are generally accompanied by a corresponding change in related fuel revenues and do not have a significant impact on net income. Southern Power is responsible for the cost of fuel for generating units that are not covered under PPAs. Power from these generating units is sold into the wholesale market or into the power pool for capacity owned directly by Southern Power.Purchased power expenses will vary depending on demand, availability, and the cost of generating resources throughout the Southern Company system and other contract resources. Load requirements are submitted to the power pool on an hourly basis and are fulfilled with the lowest cost alternative, whether that is generation owned by Southern Power, an affiliate company, or external parties. Such purchased power costs are generally recovered through PPA revenues.Details of Southern Power's fuel and purchased power expenses were as follows: 2018 2017 2016 (in millions) Fuel$699 $621 $456Purchased power176 149 102Total fuel and purchased power expenses$875 $770 $558In 2018, total fuel and purchased power expenses increased $105 million, or 14%, compared to 2017. Fuel expense increased $78 million, or 13%, primarily due to a $60 million increase associated with the volume of KWHs generated, excluding solar, wind, and tolling agreements, primarily due to customer load, and an $18 million increase associated with the average cost of natural gas per KWH generated. Purchased power expense increased $27 million, or 18%, primarily due to a $43 million increase associated with the average cost of purchased power, primarily in the first quarter 2018, partially offset by a $16 million decrease associated with the volume of KWHs purchased.In 2017, total fuel and purchased power expenses increased $212 million, or 38%, compared to 2016. Fuel expense increased $165 million, or 36%, primarily due to an $83 million increase associated with the volume of KWHs generated, excluding solar, wind, and tolling agreements, and an $82 million increase associated with the average cost of natural gas per KWH generated. Purchased power expense increased $47 million, or 46%, primarily due to a $37 million increase associated with the volume of KWHs purchased and an $11 million increase associated with the average cost of purchased power.Other Operations and Maintenance ExpensesIn 2018, other operations and maintenance expenses increased $9 million, or 2%, compared to 2017. The increase was primarily due to scheduled outage and maintenance expenses. In 2017, other operations and maintenance expenses increased $32 million, or 9%, compared to 2016. The increase was primarily due to increases of $56 million associated with new facilities, $21 million in business development and support expenses, and $6 million in employee compensation, all associated with Southern Power's overall growth. These 2017 increases were partially offset by decreases of $35 million associated with scheduled outage and maintenance expenses and $15 million in non-outage operations and maintenance expenses.II-154 Table of Contents Index to Financial StatementsMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Power Company and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual ReportDepreciation and AmortizationIn 2018, depreciation and amortization decreased $10 million, or 2%, compared to 2017, primarily due to the cessation of depreciation on the Florida Plants and Plant Mankato that were classified as held for sale in May and November 2018, respectively. In 2017, depreciation and amortization increased $151 million, or 43%, compared to 2016, primarily due to additional depreciation related to new solar, wind, and natural gas facilities placed in service. See Note 5 to the financial statements under ""Depreciation and Amortization – Southern Power"" and Note 15 to the financial statements under ""Southern Power"" and ""Assets Held for Sale"" for additional information.Taxes Other Than Income TaxesIn 2018, taxes other than income taxes decreased $2 million, or 4%, compared to 2017. In 2017, taxes other than income taxes were $48 million compared to $23 million in 2016, primarily due to additional property taxes on new facilities.Asset ImpairmentIn 2018, asset impairment charges were $156 million. In the second quarter 2018, a $119 million asset impairment charge was recorded in contemplation of the sale of the Florida Plants. In addition, in the third quarter 2018, a $36 million asset impairment charge was recorded on wind turbine equipment held for development projects. There were no asset impairment charges recorded in 2017 or 2016. See Note 15 to the financial statements under ""Southern Power – Sales of Natural Gas Plants"" and "" – Development Projects"" for additional information.Interest Expense, Net of Amounts CapitalizedIn 2018, interest expense, net of amounts capitalized decreased $8 million, or 4%, compared to 2017. The decrease was primarily due to an increase in capitalized interest associated with construction projects. In 2017, interest expense, net of amounts capitalized increased $74 million, or 63%, compared to 2016. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $44 million in interest expense related to an increase in average outstanding long-term debt, primarily to fund Southern Power's growth strategy and continuous construction program, as well as a $30 million decrease in capitalized interest associated with completing construction of and placing in service solar facilities.Other Income (Expense), NetIn 2018, other income (expense), net increased $22 million compared to 2017 primarily due to a $14 million gain from a joint-development wind project, which is attributable to Southern Power's partner in the project and fully offset within noncontrolling interests. In 2017, other income (expense), net decreased $5 million compared to 2016.Income Taxes (Benefit)In 2018, income tax benefit was $164 million compared to $939 million for 2017, a decrease of $775 million, primarily attributable to a $743 million tax benefit in 2017 and a $79 million tax expense in 2018, both related to the remeasurement of accumulated deferred income taxes in accordance with the Tax Reform Legislation. In addition, income tax benefits associated with solar ITCs decreased by $58 million as a result of fewer solar facilities being placed in service in 2018 as compared to 2017. These decreases were partially offset by $65 million of income tax benefits related to certain changes in state apportionment rates arising from reorganizations of Southern Power's legal entities that own and operate certain of its solar and wind facilities and a decrease of $47 million of income tax expense as a result of lower pre-tax earnings and the lower federal tax rate. In 2017, income tax benefit was $939 million compared to $195 million for 2016 of which $743 million of the increase was related to the Tax Reform Legislation. The remaining increase in tax benefit was primarily due to an increase of $89 million in PTCs from wind generation in 2017 and other state income taxes, significantly offset by a decrease in tax benefits associated with lower ITCs from solar facilities placed in service.See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – ""Income Tax Matters – Federal Tax Reform Legislation"" herein and Notes 1 and 10 to the financial statements under ""Income and Other Taxes"" and ""Effective Tax Rate,"" respectively, for additional information.Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling InterestsIn 2018, net income attributable to noncontrolling interests increased $13 million, or 28%, compared to 2017. The increase was primarily due to $20 million of net income allocations due to the sale of a noncontrolling 33% equity interest in SP Solar and $14 million of other income allocations attributable to a joint-development wind project, partially offset by a reduction of $19 million due to HLBV income allocations between Southern Power and tax equity partners for partnerships entered into during 2018. In II-155 Table of Contents Index to Financial StatementsMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Power Company and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual Report2017, noncontrolling interests increased $10 million, or 28%, compared to 2016 primarily due to additional net income allocations from new solar partnerships.Effects of InflationSouthern Power is party to long-term contracts reflecting market-based rates, including inflation expectations. Any adverse effect of inflation on Southern Power's results of operations has not been substantial in recent years.FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIALGeneralThe results of operations for the past three years are not necessarily indicative of Southern Power's future earnings potential. Southern Power completed multiple sales of noncontrolling interests and assets in 2018 as described below. These sales will materially decrease future earnings and cash flows to Southern Power. See below for a summary of the 2018 disposition activity. The level of Southern Power's future earnings also depends on numerous factors that affect the opportunities, challenges, and risks of Southern Power's competitive wholesale business. These factors include: Southern Power's ability to achieve sales growth while containing costs; regulatory matters; creditworthiness of customers; total generating capacity available in Southern Power's market areas; the successful remarketing of capacity as current contracts expire; and Southern Power's ability to execute its growth strategy through the development or acquisition of renewable facilities and other energy projects.On May 22, 2018, Southern Power completed the sale of a noncontrolling 33% equity interest in SP Solar, a limited partnership indirectly owning substantially all of Southern Power's solar facilities, to Global Atlantic Financial Group Limited (Global Atlantic) for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $1.2 billion. Accordingly, Global Atlantic will receive 33% of all cash distributions paid by SP Solar. Southern Power continues to consolidate the assets and liabilities of SP Solar with Global Atlantic's share of partnership earnings included in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests in the consolidated statements of income, which was $20 million for the period from May 22, 2018 to December 31, 2018.Southern Power completed the sale of all of its equity interests in the Florida Plants to NextEra Energy on December 4, 2018, for an aggregate purchase price of $203 million. Pre-tax net income for the Florida Plants was $49 million and $37 million for the period from January 1, 2018 to December 4, 2018 and for the year ended December 31, 2017, respectively.On December 11, 2018, Southern Power completed the sale of a noncontrolling tax equity interest in SP Wind, which owns a portfolio of eight operating wind facilities, to three financial investors, for approximately $1.2 billion. The tax equity investors together will generally receive 40% of the cash distributions from available cash and will receive a 99% allocation of tax attributes, including PTCs. Southern Power continues to consolidate the assets and liabilities of SP Wind with the investors' shares of partnership earnings reflected in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests in the consolidated statements of income.On November 5, 2018, Southern Power entered into an agreement with Northern States Power to sell all of its equity interests in Plant Mankato (including the 385-MW expansion currently under construction) for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $650 million. The completion of the disposition is subject to the expansion unit reaching commercial operation as well as various other customary conditions to closing, including working capital and timing adjustments. Pre-tax net income for Plant Mankato was immaterial for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. This transaction is subject to FERC and state commission approvals and is expected to close mid-2019. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.Demand for electricity is primarily driven by the pace of economic growth that may be affected by changes in regional and global economic conditions, as well as renewable portfolio standards, which may impact future earnings. Other factors that could influence future earnings include weather, transmission constraints, cost of generation from units within the power pool, and operational limitations.Power Sales AgreementsGeneralSouthern Power has PPAs with some of Southern Company's traditional electric operating companies, other investor-owned utilities, IPPs, municipalities, and other load-serving entities, as well as commercial and industrial customers. The PPAs are expected to provide Southern Power with a stable source of revenue during their respective terms.Many of Southern Power's PPAs have provisions that require Southern Power or the counterparty to post collateral or an acceptable substitute guarantee in the event that S&P or Moody's downgrades the credit ratings of the respective company to an unacceptable credit rating or if the counterparty is not rated or fails to maintain a minimum coverage ratio.II-156 Table of Contents Index to Financial StatementsMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Power Company and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual ReportOn January 29, 2019, Pacific Gas & Electric Company (PG&E) filed petitions to reorganize under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Southern Power, together with its noncontrolling partners, owns four solar facilities where PG&E is the energy off-taker for approximately 207 MWs of capacity under long-term PPAs. PG&E is also the transmission provider for these facilities and two of Southern Power's other solar facilities. Southern Power has evaluated the recoverability of its investments in these solar facilities under various scenarios, including selling the related energy into the competitive markets, and has concluded they are not impaired. At December 31, 2018, Southern Power had outstanding accounts receivables due from PG&E of $1 million related to the PPAs and $36 million related to the transmission interconnections (of which $17 million is classified in other deferred charges and assets). Southern Power does not expect a material impact to its financial statements if, as a result of the bankruptcy proceedings, PG&E does not perform in accordance with the PPAs or the terms of the PPAs are renegotiated; however, the ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time. Southern Power is working to maintain and expand its share of the wholesale markets. Southern Power expects there to be new demand for capacity that will develop in the 2019-2021 timeframe. The amount of available demand and timing will vary across the wholesale markets. Southern Power calculates an investment coverage ratio for its generating assets, which includes those assets owned in part with its various partners, based on the ratio of investment under contract to total investment using the respective generation facilities' net book value (or expected in-service value for facilities under construction) as the investment amount. With the inclusion of investments associated with the wind and natural gas facilities currently under construction, as well as other capacity and energy contracts, Southern Power has an average investment coverage ratio of 93% through 2023 and 91% through 2028, with an average remaining contract duration of approximately 14 years (including Plant Mankato, which is classified as held for sale in the financial statements). See ""Acquisitions"" and ""Construction Projects"" herein for additional information.Natural Gas and BiomassSouthern Power's electricity sales from natural gas and biomass generating units are primarily through long-term PPAs that consist of two types of agreements. The first type, referred to as a unit or block sale, is a customer purchase from a dedicated generating unit where all or a portion of the generation from that unit is reserved for that customer. Southern Power typically has the ability to serve the unit or block sale customer from an alternate resource. The second type, referred to as requirements service, provides that Southern Power serve the customer's capacity and energy requirements from a combination of the customer's own generating units and from Southern Power resources not dedicated to serve unit or block sales. Southern Power has rights to purchase power provided by the requirements customers' resources when economically viable.As a general matter, substantially all of the PPAs provide that the purchasers are responsible for either procuring the fuel (tolling agreements) or reimbursing Southern Power for substantially all of the cost of fuel or purchased power relating to the energy delivered under such PPAs. To the extent a particular generating facility does not meet the operational requirements contemplated in the PPAs, Southern Power may be responsible for excess fuel costs. With respect to fuel transportation risk, most of Southern Power's PPAs provide that the counterparties are responsible for the availability of fuel transportation to the particular generating facility.Capacity charges that form part of the PPA payments are designed to recover fixed and variable operation and maintenance costs based on dollars-per-kilowatt year. In general, to reduce Southern Power's exposure to certain operation and maintenance costs, Southern Power has LTSAs. See Note 1 to the financial statements under ""Long-Term Service Agreements"" for additional information.Solar and WindSouthern Power's electricity sales from solar and wind (renewables) generating facilities are also made pursuant to long-term PPAs; however, these solar and wind PPAs do not have a capacity charge and customers either purchase the energy output of a dedicated renewable facility through an energy charge or provide Southern Power a certain fixed price for the electricity sold to the grid. As a result, Southern Power's ability to recover fixed and variable operations and maintenance expenses is dependent upon the level of energy generated from these facilities, which can be impacted by weather conditions, equipment performance, transmission constraints, and other factors. Generally, under the solar and wind generation PPAs, the purchasing party retains the right to keep or resell the renewable energy credits.Environmental MattersSouthern Power's operations are regulated by state and federal environmental agencies through a variety of laws and regulations governing air, water, land, and protection of other natural resources. Southern Power maintains a comprehensive environmental compliance strategy to assess upcoming requirements and compliance costs associated with these environmental laws and regulations. The costs, including capital expenditures and operations and maintenance costs, required to comply with II-157 Table of Contents Index to Financial StatementsMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Power Company and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual Reportenvironmental laws and regulations may impact results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition. Compliance costs may result from the installation of additional environmental controls. The ultimate impact of the environmental laws and regulations discussed below will depend on various factors, such as state adoption and implementation of requirements, the availability and cost of any deployed control technology, fuel prices, and the outcome of pending and/or future legal challenges.New or revised environmental laws and regulations could affect many areas of Southern Power's operations. Southern Power's PPAs generally contain provisions that permit charging the counterparty with some of the new costs incurred as a result of changes in environmental laws and regulations.Since Southern Power's units are newer natural gas and renewable generating facilities, costs associated with environmental compliance for these facilities have been less significant than for similarly situated coal or older natural gas generating facilities. Environmental, natural resource, and land use concerns, including the applicability of air quality limitations, the potential presence of wetlands or threatened and endangered species, the availability of water withdrawal rights, uncertainties regarding aesthetic impacts such as increased light or noise, and concerns about potential adverse health impacts, can, however, increase the cost of siting and operating any type of future electric generating facility. The impact of such laws and regulations on Southern Power and subsequent recovery through PPA provisions cannot be determined at this time.Environmental Laws and RegulationsAir QualityIn 2011, the EPA finalized the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR) to address impacts of SO2 and NOX emissions from fossil fuel-fired electric generating plants. CSAPR establishes emissions trading programs and budgets for certain states and allocates emissions allowances for sources in those states. In 2016, the EPA published a final rule establishing more stringent ozone season NOX emissions budgets in Alabama and Texas. The EPA also removed North Carolina from this particular CSAPR program. Georgia's ozone season NOX emissions budget remained unchanged. Increases in either future fossil fuel-fired generation or the availability or cost of CSAPR allowances could have a negative financial impact on results of operations for Southern Power.Water QualityIn 2014, the EPA finalized requirements under Section 316(b) of the Clean Water Act (CWA) to regulate cooling water intake structures (CWIS) to minimize their effects on fish and other aquatic life at existing power plants (e.g. coal, natural gas, oil, and nuclear generating plants) and manufacturing facilities. The regulation requires plant-specific studies to determine applicable CWIS changes to protect organisms that either get caught on the intake screens (impingement) or are drawn into the cooling system (entrainment). Southern Power is conducting these studies and currently anticipates such changes will be limited to minor additions of monitoring equipment at certain of its electric generating plants. However, the ultimate impact of this rule will depend on the outcome of these plant-specific studies, any additional protective measures required to be incorporated into each plant's National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit based on site-specific factors, and the outcome of any legal challenges.In 2015, the EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) jointly published a final rule that revised the regulatory definition of waters of the United States (WOTUS) for all CWA programs. The rule significantly expanded the scope of federal jurisdiction over waterbodies (such as rivers, streams, canals, and wastewater treatment ponds), which could impact new generation projects. The EPA and the Corps are expected to publish a final rule in 2019 to replace the 2015 WOTUS definition. The impact of any changes to the 2015 WOTUS rule will depend on the content of this final rule and the outcome of any legal challenges.Global Climate IssuesOn December 20, 2018, the EPA published a proposed review of the Standards of Performance for Greenhouse Gas Emissions from New, Modified, and Reconstructed Stationary Sources: Electric Utility Generating Units final rule (2015 NSPS rule). The EPA's final 2015 NSPS rule set standards of performance for new, modified, and reconstructed electric utility generating units which included stationary combustion turbines and fossil-fired steam boilers. This proposal reduces the stringency of the 2015 NSPS rule by not basing the new and reconstructed fossil-fired steam boiler standards on partial carbon capture and sequestration. The impact of any changes to this rule will depend on the content of the final rule and the outcome of any legal challenges.The EPA's GHG reporting rule requires annual reporting of GHG emissions expressed in terms of metric tons of CO2 equivalent emissions for a company's operational control of facilities. Based on ownership or financial control of facilities, Southern Power's 2017 GHG emissions were approximately 13 million metric tons of CO2 equivalent. The preliminary estimate of Southern Power's 2018 GHG emissions on the same basis is approximately 14 million metric tons of CO2 equivalent.II-158 Table of Contents Index to Financial StatementsMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Power Company and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual ReportIncome Tax MattersConsolidated Income TaxesOn behalf of Southern Power, Southern Company files a consolidated federal income tax return and various state income tax returns, some of which are combined or unitary. Under a joint consolidated income tax allocation agreement, each Southern Company subsidiary's current and deferred tax expense is computed on a stand-alone basis and no subsidiary is allocated more current expense than would be paid if it filed a separate income tax return. In accordance with IRS regulations, each company is jointly and severally liable for the federal tax liability.The impact of certain tax events at Southern Company and/or its other subsidiaries can, and does, affect Southern Power's ability to utilize certain tax credits. See ""Tax Credits"" and ACCOUNTING POLICIES – ""Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates"" herein and Note 10 to the financial statements for additional information.Southern Power currently has unutilized federal ITC and PTC carryforwards totaling approximately $2.1 billion, and thus has utilized tax equity partnerships where the tax partner will take significantly all of the respective federal tax benefits on a prospective basis. These tax equity partnerships are consolidated in Southern Power's financial statements using the HLBV methodology to allocate partnership gains and losses. See Note 1 to the financial statements for additional information.Federal Tax Reform LegislationIn December 2017, the Tax Reform Legislation was signed into law and became effective on January 1, 2018. The Tax Reform Legislation, among other things, reduced the federal corporate income tax rate to 21%, retained existing renewable energy incentives, and repealed the corporate alternative minimum tax. In addition, under the Tax Reform Legislation, NOLs generated after December 31, 2017 can no longer be carried back to previous tax years but can be carried forward indefinitely, with utilization limited to 80% of taxable income of the subsequent tax year. The projected reduction of Southern Company's consolidated income tax liability resulting from the tax rate reduction also delays the expected utilization of existing tax credit carryforwards.Following the enactment of the Tax Reform Legislation, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin 118 – ""Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act"" (SAB 118), which provided for a measurement period of up to one year from the enactment date to complete accounting under GAAP for the tax effects of the legislation. Due to the complex and comprehensive nature of the enacted tax law changes and their application under GAAP, Southern Power considered all amounts recorded in the financial statements as a result of the Tax Reform Legislation ""provisional"" as discussed in SAB 118 and subject to revision prior to filing its 2017 tax return in the fourth quarter 2018. Southern Power recognized tax benefits of $743 million in 2017. Following the filing of its 2017 tax return, Southern Power recorded tax expense of $79 million to adjust the provisional amount for a total net tax benefit of $664 million as a result of the Tax Reform Legislation. As of December 31, 2018, Southern Power considered the measurement of impacts from the Tax Reform Legislation on deferred income tax assets and liabilities, primarily due to the impact of the reduction of the corporate income tax rate, to be complete.However, the IRS continues to issue regulations that provide further interpretation and guidance on the law and each state's adoption of the provisions contained in the Tax Reform Legislation remains uncertain. The ultimate impact of this matter cannot be determined at this time. In addition, the regulatory treatment of certain impacts of the Tax Reform Legislation is subject to the discretion of the FERC. See Note 10 to the financial statements under ""Current and Deferred Income Taxes"" for additional information.Tax CreditsThe Tax Reform Legislation retained the renewable energy incentives that were included in the PATH Act. The PATH Act allows for 30% ITC for solar projects that commence construction by December 31, 2019; 26% ITC for solar projects that commence construction in 2020; 22% ITC for solar projects that commence construction in 2021; and a permanent 10% ITC for solar projects that commence construction on or after January 1, 2022. In addition, the PATH Act allows for 100% PTC for wind projects that commenced construction in 2016; 80% PTC for wind projects that commenced construction in 2017; 60% PTC for wind projects that commence construction in 2018; and 40% PTC for wind projects that commence construction in 2019. Wind projects commencing construction after 2019 will not be entitled to any PTCs. Southern Power has received ITCs related to its investment in new solar facilities acquired or constructed and receives PTCs related to the first 10 years of energy production from its wind facilities, which have had, and may continue to have, a material impact on Southern Power's cash flows and net income. In 2018, Southern Power sold noncontrolling tax equity interests in SP Wind and Cactus Flats, which both qualify for PTCs, and Gaskell West 1, which qualifies for ITCs. Under these partnerships, the tax equity investors will receive 99% of the PTC and ITC tax benefits and, therefore, Southern Power's tax benefits will be materially reduced. At December 31, 2018, II-159 Table of Contents Index to Financial StatementsMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Power Company and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual ReportSouthern Power had approximately $2.1 billion of unutilized ITCs and PTCs, which are currently expected to be fully utilized by 2022, but could be further delayed. See Note 1 to the financial statements under ""Income and Other Taxes"" and Note 10 to the financial statements under ""Current and Deferred Income Taxes – Tax Credit Carryforwards"" and ""Effective Tax Rate"" for additional information regarding utilization and amortization of credits and the tax benefit related to associated basis differences.Bonus DepreciationUnder the Tax Reform Legislation, projects with binding contracts prior to September 28, 2017 and placed in service after September 27, 2017 remain eligible for bonus depreciation under the PATH Act. The PATH Act allowed for 50% bonus depreciation for 2015 through 2017, 40% bonus depreciation for 2018, and 30% bonus depreciation for 2019 and certain long-lived assets placed in service in 2020. Southern Power is not expecting material cash flows from bonus depreciation for the 2018 or 2019 tax years. However, any cash flows resulting from bonus depreciation would also be impacted by Southern Power's use of tax equity partnerships. See Note 10 to the financial statements under ""Current and Deferred Income Taxes"" for additional information. The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.AcquisitionsDuring 2018, Southern Power acquired and completed the project below and acquired the Wild Horse Mountain and Reading wind facilities discussed under ""Construction Projects"" herein.

See ""Sales of Natural Gas Plants"" below.II-160 Table of Contents Index to Financial StatementsMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Power Company and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual Report(c)In May 2018, Southern Power purchased 100% of the Wild Horse Mountain facility. Southern Power may enter into a tax equity partnership, in which case it would then own 100% of the class B membership interests. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.(d)In August 2018, Southern Power purchased 100% of the membership interests of the Reading facility from the joint development arrangement with Renewable Energy Systems Americas, Inc. described below. Southern Power may enter into a tax equity partnership, in which case it would then own 100% of the class B membership interests. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.Total aggregate construction costs for projects under construction at December 31, 2018, excluding acquisition costs, are expected to be between $575 million and $640 million for the Plant Mankato expansion, Wild Horse Mountain, and Reading facilities. At December 31, 2018, total costs of construction incurred for these projects was $289 million, and is included in CWIP, except for the Plant Mankato expansion, which is included in assets held for sale in the financial statements. See Note 15 to the financial statements under ""Southern Power"" and ""Assets Held for Sale"" for additional information.Development ProjectsDuring 2017, Southern Power purchased wind turbine equipment to be used for various development and construction projects. Any wind projects using this equipment and reaching commercial operation by the end of 2021 are expected to qualify for 80% PTCs.During 2016, Southern Power entered into a joint development agreement with Renewable Energy Systems Americas, Inc. (RES) to develop and construct wind projects. Concurrent with the agreement, Southern Power purchased wind turbine equipment from Siemens Wind Power, Inc. and Vestas-American Wind Technology, Inc. to be used for construction of these projects. Several wind projects using this equipment, as well as other purchased equipment, have successfully originated, directly or indirectly, from the partnership with RES and are expected to reach commercial operation before the end of 2020, thus qualifying for 100% PTCs.Southern Power continues to evaluate and refine the deployment of the wind turbine equipment to potential joint development and construction projects as well as the amount of MW capacity to be constructed. During the third quarter 2018, as a result of a review of various options for probable dispositions of wind turbine equipment not deployed to development or construction projects, Southern Power recorded a $36 million asset impairment charge on the equipment.Subsequent to December 31, 2018 and as part of management's continuous review of disposition options, approximately $53 million of this equipment is being marketed for sale and will be classified as held for sale.The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.Sales of Renewable Facility InterestsOn May 22, 2018, Southern Power completed the sale of a noncontrolling 33% equity interest in SP Solar, a limited partnership indirectly owning substantially all of Southern Power's solar facilities, to Global Atlantic for approximately $1.2 billion. Since Southern Power retains control of the limited partnership through its wholly-owned general partner, the sale was recorded as an equity transaction and Southern Power will continue to consolidate SP Solar in its financial statements. On the date of the transaction, the noncontrolling interest was increased by $511 million to reflect 33% of the carrying value of the partnership. This difference, partially offset by the tax impact and other related transaction charges, also resulted in a $410 million decrease to Southern Power's common stockholder's equity.On December 11, 2018, Southern Power completed the sale of a noncontrolling tax equity interest in SP Wind, which owns a portfolio of eight operating wind facilities, to three financial investors for approximately $1.2 billion. The tax equity investors together will generally receive 40% of the cash distributions from available cash and will receive 99% of the tax attributes, including future production tax credits. Since Southern Power retains control of SP Wind, Southern Power will continue to consolidate SP Wind in its financial statements.Sales of Natural Gas PlantsOn December 4, 2018, Southern Power completed the sale of all of its equity interests in the Florida Plants to NextEra Energy for $203 million. In contemplation of this sale transaction, Southern Power recorded an asset impairment charge of approximately $119 million ($89 million after tax) in May 2018. Pre-tax net income for the Florida Plants was $49 million and $37 million for the period from January 1, 2018 to December 4, 2018 and for the year ended December 31, 2017, respectively.On November 5, 2018, Southern Power entered into an agreement with Northern States Power to sell all of its equity interests in Plant Mankato (including the 385-MW expansion currently under construction) for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $650 million. The completion of the disposition is subject to the expansion unit reaching commercial operation as well as various other customary conditions to closing, including working capital and timing adjustments. The ultimate purchase price will decrease $66,667 per day for each day after June 1, 2019 that the expansion has not achieved commercial operation, not to exceed $15 million. Pre-tax net income for Plant Mankato was immaterial for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. This II-161 Table of Contents Index to Financial StatementsMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Power Company and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual Reporttransaction is subject to FERC and state commission approvals and is expected to close mid-2019. The assets and liabilities of Plant Mankato are classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2018. See Note 15 to the financial statements under ""Southern Power"" and ""Assets Held for Sale"" for additional information. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.Other MattersSouthern Power is involved in various other matters being litigated and regulatory matters that could affect future earnings. In addition, Southern Power is subject to certain claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. Southern Power's business activities are subject to extensive governmental regulation related to public health and the environment, such as laws and regulations governing air, water, land, and protection of other natural resources. Litigation over environmental issues and claims of various types, including property damage, personal injury, common law nuisance, and citizen enforcement of environmental laws and regulations, has occurred throughout the U.S. This litigation has included claims for damages alleged to have been caused by CO2 and other emissions and alleged exposure to hazardous materials, and/or requests for injunctive relief in connection with such matters.The ultimate outcome of such pending or potential litigation or regulatory matters cannot be predicted at this time; however, for current proceedings not specifically reported in Note 3 to the financial statements herein, management does not anticipate that the ultimate liabilities, if any, arising from such current proceedings would have a material effect on Southern Power's financial statements.Southern Power indirectly owns a 51% membership interest in RE Roserock LLC (Roserock), the owner of the Roserock facility in Pecos County, Texas. Prior to the facility being placed in service in 2016, certain solar panels were damaged during installation by the construction contractor, McCarthy Building Companies, Inc. (McCarthy), and certain solar panels were damaged by a hail event that also occurred during construction. In connection therewith, Southern Power is withholding payments of approximately $26 million from the construction contractor, which has placed a lien on the Roserock facility for the same amount. In May 2017, Roserock filed a lawsuit in the state district court in Pecos County, Texas, (State Court lawsuit) against XL Insurance America, Inc. (XL) and North American Elite Insurance Company (North American Elite) seeking recovery from an insurance policy for damages resulting from the hail storm and McCarthy's installation practices. On June 1, 2018, the court in the State Court lawsuit granted Roserock's motion for partial summary judgment, finding that the insurers were in breach of contract and in violation of the Texas Insurance Code for failing to pay any monies owed for the hail claim. In addition to the State Court lawsuit, lawsuits were filed between Roserock and McCarthy, as well as other parties, and that litigation has been consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas. Southern Power intends to vigorously pursue and defend these matters, the ultimate outcome of which cannot be determined at this time.ACCOUNTING POLICIESApplication of Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesSouthern Power prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP. Significant accounting policies are described in Notes 1, 4, and 10 to the financial statements. In the application of these policies, certain estimates are made that may have a material impact on Southern Power's results of operations and related disclosures. Different assumptions and measurements could produce estimates that are significantly different from those recorded in the financial statements. Senior management has reviewed and discussed the following critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of Southern Company's Board of Directors.Revenue RecognitionSouthern Power's revenue recognition depends on appropriate classification and documentation of transactions in accordance with GAAP. In general, Southern Power's power sale transactions, which include PPAs, can be classified in one of four categories: leases, non-derivatives or normal sale derivatives, derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, and derivatives not designated as hedges. For more information on derivative transactions, see FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY – ""Market Price Risk"" herein and Notes 1 and 14 to the financial statements. Southern Power's revenues are dependent upon significant judgments used to determine the appropriate transaction classification, which must be documented upon the inception of each contract.Lease TransactionsSouthern Power considers the following factors to determine whether the sales contract is a lease:•Assessing whether specific property is explicitly or implicitly identified in the agreement;II-162 Table of Contents Index to Financial StatementsMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Power Company and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual Report•Determining whether the fulfillment of the arrangement is dependent on the use of the identified property; and•Assessing whether the arrangement conveys to the purchaser the right to use the identified property.If the contract meets the above criteria for a lease, Southern Power performs further analysis as to whether the lease is classified as operating, financing, or sales-type. All of Southern Power's power sales contracts that are determined to be leases are accounted for as operating leases and the capacity revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract and is included in Southern Power's operating revenues. Energy revenues and other contingent revenues are recognized in the period the energy is delivered or the service is rendered.Non-Derivative and Normal Sale Derivative TransactionsIf the power sales contract is not classified as a lease, Southern Power further considers the following factors to determine proper classification:•Assessing whether the contract meets the definition of a derivative;•Assessing whether the contract meets the definition of a capacity contract;•Assessing the probability at inception and throughout the term of the individual contract that the contract will result in physical delivery; and•Ensuring that the contract quantities do not exceed available generating capacity (including purchased capacity).Contracts that do not meet the definition of a derivative or are designated as normal sales (i.e. capacity contracts which provide for the sale of electricity that involve physical delivery in quantities within Southern Power's available generating capacity) are accounted for as executory contracts. For contracts that have a capacity charge, the revenue is generally recognized in the period that it becomes billable. Revenues related to energy and ancillary services are recognized in the period the energy is delivered or the service is rendered. See Note 4 to the financial statements for additional information.Cash Flow Hedge TransactionsSouthern Power further considers the following in designating other derivative contracts for the sale of electricity as cash flow hedges of anticipated sale transactions:•Identifying the hedging instrument, the forecasted hedged transaction, and the nature of the risk being hedged; and•Assessing hedge effectiveness at inception and throughout the contract term. These contracts are accounted for on a fair value basis and are recorded in AOCI over the life of the contract. Realized gains and losses are then recognized in operating revenues as incurred.Derivative (Non-Hedge) TransactionsContracts for sales of electricity, which meet the definition of a derivative and that either do not qualify or are not designated as normal sales or as cash flow hedges, are accounted for on a fair value basis and are recorded in operating revenues.Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and IntangiblesSouthern Power's investments in long-lived assets are primarily generation assets, whether in service or under construction. Southern Power's intangible assets arise from certain acquisitions and consist of acquired PPAs, which are amortized to revenue over the term of the respective PPAs. Southern Power evaluates the carrying value of these assets whenever indicators of potential impairment exist. Examples of impairment indicators could include significant changes in construction schedules, current period losses combined with a history of losses or a projection of continuing losses, a significant decrease in market prices, the inability to remarket generating capacity for an extended period, the unplanned termination of a customer contract or inability of a customer to perform under the terms of the contract, or the inability to deploy wind turbine equipment to a development project. If an indicator exists, the asset is tested for recoverability by comparing the asset carrying value to the sum of the undiscounted expected future cash flows directly attributable to the asset. If the estimate of undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset, the fair value of the asset is determined and a loss is recorded. A high degree of judgment is required in developing estimates related to these evaluations, which are based on projections of various factors, including the following:•Future demand for electricity based on projections of economic growth and estimates of available generating capacity;•Future power and natural gas prices, which have been quite volatile in recent years; and•Future operating costs.II-163 Table of Contents Index to Financial StatementsMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Power Company and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual ReportIn addition, when assets are identified as held for sale, an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying value of the assets or asset group exceeds the asset fair value less cost to sell. In 2018, an impairment charge of $119 million was recorded for the Florida Plants concurrent with the assets being identified as held for sale as a result of a signed purchase and sale agreement. Also in 2018, an impairment charge of $36 million was recorded for wind turbine equipment that is no longer likely to be deployed to a wind generation project.Acquisition AccountingSouthern Power may acquire generation assets as part of its overall growth strategy. At the time of an acquisition, Southern Power will assess if these assets and activities meet the definition of a business. For acquisitions that meet the definition of a business, Southern Power includes operating results from the date of acquisition in its consolidated financial statements. The purchase price, including any contingent consideration, is allocated based on the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed (including any intangible assets). Assets acquired that do not meet the definition of a business are accounted for as an asset acquisition.The purchase price of each asset acquisition is allocated based on the relative fair value of assets acquired. Determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management judgment and Southern Power may engage independent valuation experts to assist in this process. Fair values are determined by using market participant assumptions, and typically include the timing and amounts of future cash flows, incurred construction costs, the nature of acquired contracts, discount rates, power market prices, and expected asset lives. Any due diligence or transition costs incurred by Southern Power for potential or successful acquisitions are expensed as incurred.Contingent consideration primarily relates to fixed amounts due to the seller once the facility is placed in service. For contingent consideration with variable payments, Southern Power fair values the arrangement with any changes recorded in the consolidated statements of income. See Note 13 to the financial statements for additional fair value information and Note 15 to the financial statements for additional information on recent acquisitions.Accounting for Income TaxesThe consolidated income tax provision and deferred income tax assets and liabilities, as well as any unrecognized tax benefits and valuation allowances, require significant judgment and estimates. These estimates are supported by historical tax return data, reasonable projections of taxable income, and interpretations of applicable tax laws and regulations across multiple taxing jurisdictions. The effective tax rate reflects the statutory tax rates and calculated apportionments for the various states in which Southern Power operates.On behalf of Southern Power, Southern Company files a consolidated federal income tax return and various state income tax returns, some of which are combined or unitary. Under a joint consolidated income tax allocation agreement, each Southern Company subsidiary's current and deferred tax expense is computed on a stand-alone basis and no subsidiary is allocated more current expense than would be paid if it filed a separate income tax return. Certain deductions and credits can be limited at the consolidated or combined level resulting in NOL and tax credit carryforwards that would not otherwise result on a stand-alone basis. Utilization of NOL and tax credit carryforwards and the assessment of valuation allowances are based on significant judgment and extensive analysis of Southern Power's, as well as Southern Company's, current financial position and results of operations, including currently available information about future years, to estimate when future taxable income will be realized.Current and deferred state income tax liabilities and assets are estimated based on laws of multiple states that determine the income to be apportioned to their jurisdictions. States utilize various formulas to calculate the apportionment of taxable income, primarily using sales, assets, or payroll within the jurisdiction compared to the consolidated totals. In addition, each state varies as to whether a stand-alone, combined, or unitary filing methodology is required. The calculation of deferred state taxes considers apportionment factors and filing methodologies that are expected to apply in future years. The apportionments and methodologies which are ultimately finalized in a manner inconsistent with expectations could have a material effect on Southern Power's financial statements.Given the significant judgment involved in estimating NOL and tax credit carryforwards and multi-state apportionments for all subsidiaries, Southern Power considers federal and state deferred income tax liabilities and assets to be critical accounting estimates.Recently Issued Accounting StandardsSee Note 1 to the financial statements under ""Recently Adopted Accounting Standards"" for additional information.In 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) (ASU 2016-02). ASU 2016-02 requires lessees to recognize on the balance sheet a lease liability and a right-of-use asset for all leases. ASU 2016-02 also changes the recognition, measurement, II-164 Table of Contents Index to Financial StatementsMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Power Company and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual Reportand presentation of expense associated with leases and provides clarification regarding the identification of certain components of contracts that would represent a lease. The accounting required by lessors is relatively unchanged. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 and Southern Power adopted the new standard effective January 1, 2019.Southern Power elected the transition methodology provided by ASU No. 2018-11, Leases (Topic 842): Targeted Improvements, whereby the requirements of ASU 2016-02 are applied on a prospective basis as of the adoption date of January 1, 2019, without restating prior periods. Southern Power elected the package of practical expedients provided by ASU 2016-02 that allows prior determinations of whether existing contracts are, or contain, leases and the classification of existing leases to continue without reassessment. Additionally, Southern Power expects to apply the use-of-hindsight practical expedient in determining lease terms as of the date of adoption. Southern Power also made accounting policy elections to account for short-term leases in all asset classes as off-balance sheet leases and combined lessee lease and non-lease components in the computations of lease obligations and right-of-use assets for most asset classes, while lessor lease and non-lease components are accounted for separately.Southern Power completed the implementation of a new application to track and account for its leases and updated its internal controls and accounting policies to support the accounting for leases under ASU 2016-02. Southern Power completed its lease inventory and determined its most significant leases as a lessee involve real estate. In the first quarter 2019, the adoption of ASU 2016-02 resulted in recording lease liabilities and right-of-use assets on Southern Power's balance sheet each totaling approximately $0.4 billion, with no impact on Southern Power's statement of income.FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITYOverviewSouthern Power's financial condition remained stable at December 31, 2018. Southern Power's cash requirements primarily consist of funding ongoing business operations, common stock dividends, distributions to noncontrolling interests, capital expenditures, and debt maturities. Capital expenditures and other investing activities may include investments in acquisitions or new construction associated with Southern Power's overall growth strategy and to maintain the existing generation fleet's performance. Operating cash flows, which may include the utilization of tax credits, will only provide a portion of Southern Power's cash needs. For the three-year period from 2019 through 2021, Southern Power's projected common stock dividends, distributions to noncontrolling interests, capital expenditures, and debt maturities are expected to exceed operating cash flows. Southern Power plans to finance future cash needs in excess of its operating cash flows primarily through external securities issuances, borrowings from financial institutions, and equity contributions from Southern Company. Southern Power intends to continue to monitor its access to short-term and long-term capital markets as well as its bank credit agreements to meet future capital and liquidity needs. See ""Sources of Capital,"" ""Financing Activities,"" and ""Contractual Obligations"" herein for additional information on lines of credit.Southern Power also utilizes tax equity partnerships, as one of its financing sources, where the tax partner takes significantly all of the federal tax benefits. These tax equity partnerships are consolidated in Southern Power's financial statements and are accounted for using a HLBV methodology to allocate partnership gains and losses. During 2018, Southern Power obtained tax equity funding for the Gaskell West 1 solar project, the Cactus Flats wind project, and the SP Wind portfolio and received proceeds of approximately $26 million, $122 million, and $1.2 billion, respectively.On May 22, 2018, Southern Power completed the sale of a noncontrolling 33% equity interest in SP Solar, a limited partnership indirectly owning substantially all of Southern Power's solar facilities, to Global Atlantic for approximately $1.2 billion. Accordingly, Global Atlantic will receive 33% of all cash distributions paid by SP Solar.On December 4, 2018, Southern Power completed the sale of all of its equity interests in the Florida Plants to NextEra Energy for $203 million. On November 5, 2018, Southern Power entered into an agreement with Northern States Power to sell all of its equity interests in Plant Mankato (including the 385-MW expansion currently under construction) for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $650 million. The completion of the disposition is subject to the expansion unit reaching commercial operation as well as various other customary conditions to closing, and is expected to close mid-2019. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.Net cash provided from operating activities totaled $631 million in 2018, a decrease of $524 million compared to 2017. The decrease was primarily due to lower income tax refunds as a result of taxable gains arising from the sales of noncontrolling interests in SP Solar and SP Wind, as well as the sale of the Florida Plants. At December 31, 2018, Southern Power had $2.1 billion of unutilized ITCs and PTCs which are expected to be fully utilized by 2022. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – ""Income Tax Matters – Tax Credits"" herein for additional information. Net cash provided from operating activities totaled $1.2 billion in 2017, an increase of $816 million compared to 2016 primarily due to income tax refunds received and an increase in energy sales from new solar and wind facilities, partially offset by an increase in interest paid.II-165 Table of Contents Index to Financial StatementsMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Power Company and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual ReportNet cash used for investing activities totaled $227 million, $1.6 billion, and $4.8 billion in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively, and decreased in 2018 primarily due to fewer acquisitions and completion of construction of renewable facilities during 2017 and 2018. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – ""Acquisitions"" and ""Construction Projects"" herein and Note 15 to the financial statements for additional information.Net cash used for financing activities totaled $363 million in 2018 primarily due to returns of capital to Southern Company, payments of common stock dividends, and distributions to noncontrolling interests, partially offset by capital contributions from noncontrolling interests. Net cash used for financing activities totaled $502 million in 2017 primarily due to payments of common stock dividends and distributions to noncontrolling interests. Net cash provided from financing activities totaled $4.7 billion in 2016 primarily due to the issuance of additional senior notes and capital contributions from Southern Company and noncontrolling interests.Significant balance sheet changes include a $745 million decrease in plant in service and a $576 million increase in assets held for sale primarily due to completed and planned plant divestitures and a $355 million increase in deferred income taxes primarily due to $551 million related to the sales of noncontrolling interests in SP Solar and SP Wind and $129 million in additional unutilized PTCs, partially offset by a $333 million decrease in the federal NOL carryforward.Sources of CapitalSouthern Power plans to obtain the funds required for acquisitions, construction, development, debt maturities, and other purposes from operating cash flows, external securities issuances, borrowings from financial institutions, tax equity partnership contributions, divestitures, and equity contributions from Southern Company. However, the amount, type, and timing of any future financings, if needed, will depend upon prevailing market conditions, regulatory approval, and other factors. With respect to the public offering of securities, Southern Power (excluding its subsidiaries) issues and offers debt registered on registration statements filed with the SEC under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.Southern Power's current liabilities sometimes exceed current assets due to the use of short-term debt as a funding source and construction payables, as well as fluctuations in cash needs due to seasonality. Southern Power believes the need for working capital can be adequately met by utilizing the commercial paper program, the Facility (as defined below), borrowings from financial institutions, equity contributions from Southern Company, external securities issuances, and operating cash flows.Southern Power obtains its own financing separately without any credit support from Southern Company or any other affiliate. The Southern Company system does not maintain a centralized cash or money pool. Therefore, funds of Southern Power are not commingled with funds of any other company in the Southern Company system. To meet liquidity and capital resource requirements, Southern Power had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $181 million at December 31, 2018.Southern Power's commercial paper program is used to finance acquisition and construction costs related to electric generating facilities and for general corporate purposes, including maturing debt. Southern Power's subsidiaries are not issuers under the commercial paper program. Short-term borrowings are included in notes payable on the consolidated balance sheets.II-166 Table of Contents Index to Financial StatementsMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Power Company and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual ReportDetails of short-term borrowings were as follows: Short-term Borrowings at theEnd of the Period Short-term Borrowings During the Period (*) Amount Outstanding Weighted Average Interest Rate Average Amount Outstanding Weighted Average Interest Rate Maximum Amount Outstanding (in millions) (in millions) (in millions)December 31, 2018 Commercial paper$— —% $77 2.2% $304Short-term bank debt100 3.1% 111 2.7% 200Total$100 3.1% $188 2.5% December 31, 2017 Commercial paper$105 2.0% $215 1.4% $419Short-term bank debt— —% 17 2.1% 209Total$105 2.0% $232 1.4% December 31, 2016 Commercial paper$— —% $56 0.8% $310Total$— —% $56 0.8% (*)Average and maximum amounts are based upon daily balances during the twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016.In addition to the short-term borrowings of Southern Power included in the table above, at December 31, 2016, Southern Power subsidiaries assumed credit agreements (Project Credit Facilities) with the acquisition of certain solar facilities, which were non-recourse to the Southern Power parent company, the proceeds of which were used to finance project costs related to such solar facilities. The Project Credit Facilities were fully repaid in January 2017. For the year ended December 31, 2016, the Project Credit Facilities had a maximum amount outstanding of $828 million and an average amount outstanding of $566 million at a weighted average interest rate of 2.1% and had total amounts outstanding of $209 million at a weighted average interest rate of 2.1% at December 31, 2016.Company Credit FacilitiesAt December 31, 2018, Southern Power had a committed credit facility (Facility) of $750 million expiring in 2022, of which $23 million has been used for letters of credit and $727 million remains unused. Southern Power's subsidiaries are not borrowers under the Facility. Proceeds from the Facility may be used for working capital and general corporate purposes as well as liquidity support for Southern Power's commercial paper program. A portion of the unused credit under the Facility is allocated to provide liquidity support for Southern Power's commercial paper program. Subject to applicable market conditions, Southern Power expects to renew or replace the Facility, as needed, prior to expiration. In connection therewith, Southern Power may extend the maturity date and/or increase or decrease the lending commitment thereunder. See Note 8 to the financial statements under ""Bank Credit Arrangements"" for additional information.The Facility, as well as Southern Power's term loan agreements, contains a covenant that limits the ratio of debt to capitalization (as defined in the Facility) to a maximum of 65% and contains a cross-default provision that is restricted only to indebtedness of Southern Power. For the purposes of this definition, debt would exclude any project debt incurred by certain subsidiaries of Southern Power to the extent such debt is non-recourse to Southern Power, and capitalization would exclude the capital stock or other equity attributable to such subsidiary. Southern Power is currently in compliance with all of these covenants.Southern Power also has a $120 million continuing letter of credit facility for standby letters of credit. In December 2018, Southern Power amended the letter of credit facility, which, among other things, extended the expiration date from 2019 to 2021. At December 31, 2018, $103 million has been used for letters of credit, primarily as credit support for PPA requirements, and $17 million was unused. Southern Power's subsidiaries are not parties to this letter of credit facility.In addition, at December 31, 2018 and 2017, Southern Power had $103 million and $113 million, respectively, of cash collateral posted related to PPA requirements.II-167 Table of Contents Index to Financial StatementsMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Power Company and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual ReportFinancing ActivitiesSenior NotesIn June 2018, Southern Power repaid $350 million aggregate principal amount of Series 2015A 1.50% Senior Notes due June 1, 2018.In addition to any financings that may be necessary to meet capital requirements and contractual obligations, Southern Power plans to continue, when economically feasible, a program to retire higher-cost securities and replace these obligations with lower-cost capital if market conditions permit.Other DebtIn May 2018, Southern Power repaid $420 million aggregate principal amount of long-term floating rate bank loans.Also in May 2018, Southern Power entered into two short-term floating rate bank loans, each for an aggregate principal amount of $100 million, which bear interest based on one-month LIBOR, and proceeds being used for general corporate purposes. In November 2018, Southern Power repaid one of these short-term loans.Credit Rating RiskSouthern Power does not have any credit arrangements that would require material changes in payment schedules or terminations as a result of a credit rating downgrade.There are certain contracts that could require collateral, but not accelerated payment, in the event of a credit rating change to BBB and/or Baa2 or below. These contracts are for physical electricity purchases and sales, fuel transportation and storage, energy price risk management, and transmission.The maximum potential collateral requirements under these contracts at December 31, 2018 were as follows:Credit RatingsMaximum Potential Collateral Requirements (in millions)At BBB and/or Baa2$29At BBB- and/or Baa3$338At BB+ and/or Ba1 (*)$980(*)Any additional credit rating downgrades at or below BB- and/or Ba3 could increase collateral requirements up to an additional $38 million.Included in these amounts are certain agreements that could require collateral in the event that either Alabama Power or Georgia Power (affiliate companies of Southern Power) has a credit rating change to below investment grade. Generally, collateral may be provided by a Southern Company guaranty, letter of credit, or cash. Additionally, a credit rating downgrade could impact the ability of Southern Power to access capital markets and would be likely to impact the cost at which it does so.In addition, Southern Power has a PPA that could require collateral, but not accelerated payment, in the event of a downgrade of Southern Power's credit. The PPA requires credit assurances without stating a specific credit rating. The amount of collateral required would depend upon actual losses resulting from a credit downgrade.On September 28, 2018, Fitch assigned a negative rating outlook to the ratings of Southern Company and certain of its subsidiaries (including Southern Power).Market Price RiskSouthern Power is exposed to market risks, primarily commodity price risk, interest rate risk, and occasionally foreign currency exchange rate risk. To manage the volatility attributable to these exposures, Southern Power nets its exposures, where possible, to take advantage of natural offsets and enters into various derivative transactions for the remaining exposures pursuant to Southern Power's policies in areas such as counterparty exposure and risk management practices. Southern Power's policy is that derivatives are to be used primarily for hedging purposes and mandates strict adherence to all applicable risk management policies. Derivative positions are monitored using techniques including, but not limited to, market valuation, value at risk, stress testing, and sensitivity analysis. Derivative instruments are recognized at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets as either assets or liabilities and are presented on a gross basis. In the statements of cash flows, the cash impacts of settled energy-related and interest rate derivatives are recorded as operating activities.II-168 Table of Contents Index to Financial StatementsMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Power Company and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual ReportAt December 31, 2018, Southern Power had $525 million of long-term variable rate notes outstanding. If Southern Power sustained a 100 basis point change in interest rates for its variable interest rate exposure, the change would affect annualized interest expense by approximately $5 million at December 31, 2018. Since a significant portion of outstanding indebtedness bears interest at fixed rates, Southern Power is not aware of any facts or circumstances that would significantly affect exposure on existing indebtedness in the near term. However, the impact on future financing costs cannot be determined at this time.Southern Power had foreign currency denominated debt of €1.1 billion at December 31, 2018. Southern Power has mitigated its exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk through the use of foreign currency swaps converting all interest and principal payments to fixed-rate U.S. dollars.Because energy from Southern Power's facilities is primarily sold under long-term PPAs with tolling agreements and provisions shifting substantially all of the responsibility for fuel cost to the counterparties, Southern Power's exposure to market volatility in commodity fuel prices and prices of electricity is generally limited. However, Southern Power has been and may continue to be exposed to market volatility in energy-related commodity prices as a result of uncontracted generating capacity.For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the changes in fair value of energy-related derivative contracts associated with both power and natural gas positions were as follows: 20182017 (in millions)Contracts outstanding at the beginning of period, assets (liabilities), net$(10)$16Contracts realized or settled10(17)Current period changes (*)(4)(9)Contracts outstanding at the end of period, assets (liabilities), net$(4)$(10)(*)Current period changes also include changes in the fair value of new contracts entered into during the period, if any.For the years ending December 31, 2018 and 2017, the changes in contracts outstanding were attributable to both the volume and the prices of power and natural gas as follows: 20182017Power – net sold MWH (in millions)2.53.0Weighted average contract cost per MWH above (below) market prices (in dollars)$(0.23)$(2.67)Natural Gas – net purchased Commodity - mmBtu (in millions)15.014.4Commodity - weighted average contract cost per mmBtu above (below) market prices (in dollars)$0.22$0.12Gains and losses on energy-related derivatives designated as cash flow hedges which are used by Southern Power to hedge anticipated purchases and sales are initially deferred in OCI before being recognized in income in the same period as the hedged transactions are reflected in earnings. Gains and losses on energy-related derivative contracts that are not designated or fail to qualify as hedges are recognized in the consolidated statements of income as incurred.Southern Power uses over-the-counter contracts that are not exchange traded but are fair valued using prices which are market observable, and thus fall into Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. See Note 13 to the financial statements for further discussion of fair value measurements. The energy-related derivative contracts outstanding at December 31, 2018 mature through 2020.Southern Power is exposed to losses related to financial instruments in the event of counterparties' nonperformance. Southern Power only enters into agreements and material transactions with counterparties that have investment grade credit ratings by S&P and Moody's or with counterparties who have posted collateral to cover potential credit exposure. Southern Power has also established risk management policies and controls to determine and monitor the creditworthiness of counterparties in order to mitigate Southern Power's exposure to counterparty credit risk. Therefore, Southern Power does not anticipate a material adverse effect on the financial statements as a result of counterparty nonperformance. See Note 1 to the financial statements under ""Financial Instruments"" and Note 14 to the financial statements for additional information.Capital Requirements and Contractual ObligationsThe capital program of Southern Power is subject to periodic review and revision and is currently estimated to total $0.9 billion over the next five years through 2023. This includes committed construction, capital improvements, and work to be performed II-169 Table of Contents Index to Financial StatementsMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Power Company and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual Reportunder LTSAs, totaling approximately $300 million for each of 2019 and 2020 and an average of approximately $100 million each year from 2021 through 2023. In addition, Southern Power has a further $2.3 billion in planned expenditures for plant acquisitions and placeholder growth, or approximately $0.5 billion per year on average for 2019 through 2023. Planned expenditures for plant acquisitions and placeholder growth may vary materially due to market opportunities and Southern Power's ability to execute its growth strategy. Actual construction costs may vary from these estimates because of numerous factors such as: changes in business conditions; changes in the expected environmental compliance program; changes in environmental laws and regulations; the outcome of any legal challenges to environmental rules; changes in FERC rules and regulations; changes in load projections; changes in legislation; the cost and efficiency of construction labor, equipment, and materials; project scope and design changes; and the cost of capital. See Note 15 to the financial statements under ""Southern Power"" for additional information.Southern Power forecasts contributions to the pension and other postretirement benefit plans over a three-year period. Southern Power anticipates no mandatory contributions to the qualified pension plan during the next three years. See Note 11 to the financial statements for additional information.Funding requirements related to obligations associated with scheduled maturities of long-term debt, as well as the related interest, leases, derivative obligations, and other purchase commitments are detailed in the contractual obligations table that follows. See Notes 1, 8, 9, and 14 to the financial statements for additional information.Contractual ObligationsContractual obligations at December 31, 2018 were as follows: 2019 2020-2021 2022-2023 After2023 Total (in millions)Long-term debt(a) — Principal$600 $1,125 $967 $2,339 $5,031Interest179 310 250 1,409 2,148Financial derivative obligations(b)6 2 — — 8Operating leases(c)23 48 50 874 995Purchase commitments — Capital(d)252 461 144 — 857Fuel(e)601 744 369 32 1,746Purchased power(f)41 83 — — 124Other(g)168 309 221 1,471 2,169Total$1,870 $3,082 $2,001 $6,125 $13,078(a)All amounts are reflected based on final maturity dates and include the effects of interest rate derivatives employed to manage interest rate risk and effects of foreign currency swaps employed to manage foreign currency exchange rate risk. Included in debt principal is an $18 million gain related to the foreign currency hedge of €1.1 billion. Southern Power plans to continue, when economically feasible, to retire higher-cost securities and replace these obligations with lower-cost capital if market conditions permit.(b)For additional information, see Notes 1 and 14 to the financial statements.(c)Operating lease commitments include certain land leases for solar and wind facilities that may be subject to annual price escalation based on indices. See Note 9 to the financial statements for additional information.(d)Southern Power provides estimated capital expenditures for a five-year period, including capital expenditures associated with environmental regulations. Excluded from these amounts are planned expenditures for plant acquisitions and placeholder growth of $2.3 billion. Also excluded from these amounts are capital expenditures covered under LTSAs which are reflected in ""Other."" See Note (g) below. At December 31, 2018, significant purchase commitments were outstanding in connection with the construction program. No ARO settlements are projected during the five-year period.(e)Primarily includes commitments to purchase, transport, and store natural gas. Amounts reflected are based on contracted cost and may contain provisions for price escalation. Amounts reflected for natural gas purchase commitments are based on various indices at the time of delivery and have been estimated based on the NYMEX future prices at December 31, 2018.(f)Purchased power commitments will be resold under a third party agreement at cost.(g)Includes commitments related to LTSAs, operation and maintenance agreements, and transmission. LTSAs include price escalation based on inflation indices. Transmission commitments are based on the Southern Company system's current tariff rate for point-to-point transmission.II-170 Table of Contents Index to Financial StatementsMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSSouthern Company Gas and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual ReportOVERVIEW Business ActivitiesSouthern Company Gas is an energy services holding company whose primary business is the distribution of natural gas. Subsequent to the dispositions of Elizabethtown Gas, Elkton Gas, and Florida City Gas discussed herein under ""Merger, Acquisition, and Disposition Activities,"" Southern Company Gas has natural gas distribution utilities in four states – Illinois, Georgia, Virginia, and Tennessee. Southern Company Gas is also involved in several other complementary businesses.Southern Company Gas manages its business through four reportable segments – gas distribution operations, gas pipeline investments, wholesale gas services, which includes Sequent, a natural gas asset optimization company, and gas marketing services, which includes SouthStar, a provider of energy-related products and services to natural gas markets – and one non-reportable segment, all other. During the fourth quarter 2018, Southern Company Gas changed its reportable segments to further align with the way its new Chief Operating Decision Maker reviews operating results and has reclassified prior years' data to conform to the new reportable segment presentation. This change resulted in a new reportable segment, gas pipeline investments, which was formerly included in gas midstream operations. Gas pipeline investments consists primarily of joint ventures in natural gas pipeline investments including a 50% interest in SNG, two significant pipeline construction projects, and a 50% joint ownership interest in the Dalton Pipeline. Gas distribution operations, wholesale gas services, and gas marketing services continue to remain as separate reportable segments and reflect the impact of the Southern Company Gas Dispositions. The all other non-reportable segment includes segments below the quantitative threshold for separate disclosure, including the storage and fuels operations that were formerly included in gas midstream operations, and other subsidiaries that fall below the quantitative threshold for separate disclosure. See Notes 5, 7, and 16 to the financial statements for additional information.Many factors affect the opportunities, challenges, and risks of Southern Company Gas' business. These factors include the ability to maintain safety, to maintain constructive regulatory environments, to maintain and grow natural gas sales and number of customers, and to effectively manage and secure timely recovery of costs. These costs include those related to projected long-term demand growth, environmental standards, safety, reliability, resilience, natural gas, and capital expenditures, including updating and expanding the natural gas distribution systems. The natural gas distribution utilities have various regulatory mechanisms that address cost recovery. Effectively operating pursuant to these regulatory mechanisms and appropriately balancing required costs and capital expenditures with customer prices will continue to challenge Southern Company Gas for the foreseeable future. Nicor Gas filed a rate case on November 9, 2018 and Atlanta Gas Light is required to file a rate case no later than June 1, 2019. These rate cases are both expected to conclude in 2019; however, the ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – ""Regulatory Matters – Rate Proceedings"" herein and Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Southern Company Gas – Rate Proceedings"" for additional information.Merger, Acquisition, and Disposition ActivitiesIn 2016, Southern Company Gas completed the Merger, pursuant to which Southern Company Gas became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Southern Company. Southern Company accounted for the Merger using the acquisition method of accounting whereby the assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recognized at fair value as of the acquisition date. Pushdown accounting was applied to create a new cost basis for Southern Company Gas' assets, liabilities, and equity as of the acquisition date. Accordingly, the successor financial statements reflect the new basis of accounting, and successor and predecessor period financial results (separated by a heavy black line) are presented, but are not comparable. As a result of the application of acquisition accounting, certain discussions herein include disclosure of the predecessor and successor periods. See Note 15 to the financial statements under ""Southern Company Merger with Southern Company Gas"" for additional information.In 2016, Southern Company Gas completed its purchase of Piedmont's 15% interest in SouthStar for $160 million and paid $1.4 billion to acquire a 50% equity interest in SNG, which is the owner of a 7,000-mile pipeline system connecting natural gas supply basins in Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama to markets in Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, and Tennessee. The investment in SNG is accounted for using the equity method. In March 2017, Southern Company Gas made an additional $50 million contribution to maintain its 50% equity interest in SNG. See Note 7 to the financial statements under ""Southern Company Gas"" and Note 15 to the financial statements under ""Southern Company Gas – Investment in SNG"" for additional information.During 2018, Southern Company Gas completed the following sales, resulting in approximately $2.7 billion in aggregate proceeds:•On June 4, 2018, Southern Company Gas completed the stock sale of Pivotal Home Solutions to American Water Enterprises LLC for a total cash purchase price of $365 million, which includes the final working capital adjustment. II-171 Table of Contents Index to Financial StatementsMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company Gas and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual ReportThis disposition resulted in a net loss of $67 million, which includes $34 million of income tax expense. In contemplation of the transaction, a goodwill impairment charge of $42 million was recorded in 2018.•On July 1, 2018, a Southern Company Gas subsidiary, Pivotal Utility Holdings, completed the sales of the assets of two of its natural gas distribution utilities, Elizabethtown Gas and Elkton Gas, to South Jersey Industries, Inc. for a total cash purchase price of $1.7 billion, which includes the final working capital and other adjustments. This disposition resulted in a pre-tax gain that was entirely offset by $205 million of income tax expense, resulting in no material net income impact.•On July 29, 2018, Southern Company Gas and its wholly-owned direct subsidiary, NUI Corporation, completed the stock sale of Pivotal Utility Holdings, which primarily consisted of Florida City Gas, to NextEra Energy for a total cash purchase price of $587 million, which includes the final working capital adjustment less indebtedness assumed at closing. This disposition resulted in a net gain of $16 million, which includes $103 million of income tax expense.The after-tax gain and loss on these dispositions included income tax expense on goodwill not deductible for tax purposes and for which a deferred tax liability had not been recorded previously. See Note 15 to the financial statements under ""Southern Company Gas"" herein for additional information.Operating MetricsSouthern Company Gas continues to focus on several operating metrics, including Heating Degree Days, customer count, and volumes of natural gas sold.Southern Company Gas measures weather and the effect on its business using Heating Degree Days. Generally, increased Heating Degree Days result in higher demand for natural gas on Southern Company Gas' distribution system. With the exception of Nicor Gas, Southern Company Gas has various regulatory mechanisms, such as weather normalization and straight-fixed-variable rate design, which limit its exposure to weather changes within typical ranges in each of its utilities' respective service territory. However, the operating revenues from utility customers in Illinois and gas marketing services customers primarily in Georgia and Illinois can be impacted by warmer- or colder-than-normal weather. Southern Company Gas utilizes weather hedges to limit the negative income impacts in the event of warmer-than-normal weather, while retaining a significant portion of the positive benefits of colder-than-normal weather for these businesses.The number of customers served by gas distribution operations and gas marketing services can be impacted by natural gas prices, economic conditions, and competition from alternative fuels. Gas marketing services' customers are primarily located in Georgia and Illinois.Southern Company Gas' natural gas volume metrics for gas distribution operations and gas marketing services illustrate the effects of weather and customer demand for natural gas. Wholesale gas services' physical sales volumes represent the daily average natural gas volumes sold to its customers.See RESULTS OF OPERATIONS herein for additional information on these operating metrics.II-172 Table of Contents Index to Financial StatementsMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company Gas and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual ReportSeasonality of ResultsDuring the Heating Season, natural gas usage and operating revenues are generally higher as more customers are connected to the gas distribution systems and natural gas usage is higher in periods of colder weather. Occasionally in the summer, wholesale gas services' operating revenues are impacted due to peak usage by power generators in response to summer energy demands. Southern Company Gas' base operating expenses, excluding cost of natural gas, bad debt expense, and certain incentive compensation costs, are incurred relatively evenly throughout the year. Seasonality also affects the comparison of certain balance sheet items across quarters, including receivables, unbilled revenues, natural gas for sale, and notes payable. However, these items are comparable when reviewing Southern Company Gas' annual results. Thus, Southern Company Gas' operating results can vary significantly from quarter to quarter as a result of seasonality, which is illustrated in the table below. Percent Generated During Heating Season Operating Revenues Net IncomeSuccessor - 2018 68.7% 96.0%Successor - 2017 67.3% 73.7%Successor - July 1, 2016 through December 31, 2016 67.1% 96.5%Predecessor - January 1, 2016 through June 30, 2016 70.0% 138.9%EarningsNet income attributable to Southern Company Gas for the successor year ended December 31, 2018 was $372 million, representing a $129 million, or 53.1%, increase over the previous year. Excluding a $121 million decrease related to the Southern Company Gas Dispositions, net income attributable to Southern Company Gas increased $251 million. This increase was primarily due to lower income tax expense, increased commercial activity at wholesale gas services, increased operating revenues from infrastructure replacement programs and base rate changes at gas distribution operations, and higher earnings from Southern Company Gas' investment in SNG. These increases were partially offset by higher other operations and maintenance expenses primarily due to increased compensation and benefit costs and disposition-related costs, higher depreciation on continued infrastructure investments at gas distribution operations, additional interest expense on new debt issuances, and an increase in charitable donations.Net income attributable to Southern Company Gas for the successor year ended December 31, 2017 was $243 million, which included net income of $53 million from Southern Company Gas' investment in SNG and $44 million generated from Southern Company Gas' continued investment in infrastructure replacement programs and base rate increases at Atlanta Gas Light, Elizabethtown Gas, and Virginia Natural Gas, less the associated increases in depreciation. Net income also reflects $130 million of additional tax expense resulting from the revaluation of deferred tax assets of $93 million related to the Tax Reform Legislation and $37 million associated with State of Illinois income tax legislation enacted in the third quarter 2017 and new income tax apportionment factors in several states resulting from Southern Company Gas' inclusion in the consolidated Southern Company state tax filings. Also included in net income was $17 million of additional expense resulting from the pushdown of acquisition accounting. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – ""Income Tax Matters"" herein and Notes 10 and 15 to the financial statements for additional information.Net income attributable to Southern Company Gas for the successor period of July 1, 2016 through December 31, 2016 was $114 million, which included $26 million in earnings from the SNG investment, net of related interest expense, partially offset by $12 million of additional expense resulting from the impact of the pushdown of acquisition accounting and $27 million of Merger-related expenses.Net income attributable to Southern Company Gas for the predecessor period of January 1, 2016 through June 30, 2016 was $131 million, which included $41 million of Merger-related expenses and $14 million of net income attributable to the SouthStar noncontrolling interest, which Southern Company Gas purchased in October 2016. Net income for the predecessor period reflected higher revenues from continued investment in infrastructure programs, partially offset by warm weather, net of hedging, and low earnings from wholesale gas services due to mark-to-market losses.II-173 Table of Contents Index to Financial StatementsMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company Gas and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual ReportRESULTS OF OPERATIONSOperating ResultsA condensed income statement for Southern Company Gas follows: Successor Predecessor Year Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, July 1, 2016 through December 31, January 1, 2016 through June 30, 2018 2017 2016 2016 (in millions) (in millions)Operating revenues$3,909 $3,920 $1,652 $1,905Cost of natural gas1,539 1,601 613 755Cost of other sales12 29 10 14Other operations and maintenance981 945 480 452Depreciation and amortization500 501 238 206Taxes other than income taxes211 184 71 99Goodwill impairment42 — — —Gain on dispositions, net (291) — — —Merger-related expenses— — 41 56Total operating expenses2,994 3,260 1,453 1,582Operating income915 660 199 323Earnings from equity method investments148 106 60 2Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized228 200 81 96Other income (expense), net1 44 12 3Earnings before income taxes836 610 190 232Income taxes464 367 76 87Net Income 372 243 114 145Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest(*)— — — 14Net Income Attributable to Southern Company Gas$372 $243 $114 $131 (*)Includes Piedmont's 15% interest in SouthStar, which was acquired by Southern Company Gas in 2016.

Detailed variance explanations are provided herein. See Note 15 to the financial statements under ""Southern Company Gas"" for additional information on the Southern Company Gas Dispositions.Operating RevenuesOperating revenues for the successor year ended December 31, 2018 were $3.9 billion, reflecting an $11 million decrease from 2017. Operating revenues for the successor year ended December 31, 2017 and the successor period of July 1, 2016 through December 31, 2016 were $3.9 billion and $1.7 billion, respectively. For the predecessor period of January 1, 2016 through June 30, 2016, operating revenues were $1.9 billion.II-174 Table of Contents Index to Financial StatementsMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company Gas and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual ReportFor the successor year ended December 31, 2018, details of operating revenues were as follows: (in millions) (% change)Operating revenues – prior year$3,920 Estimated change resulting from – Infrastructure replacement programs and base rate changes31 0.8Gas costs and other cost recovery3 0.1Weather13 0.3Wholesale gas services138 3.5Southern Company Gas Dispositions(*)(228) (5.8)Other32 0.8Operating revenues – current year$3,909 (0.3)%(*)Includes a $154 million decrease related to natural gas revenues, including alternative revenue programs, and a $74 million decrease related to other revenues. See Note 15 to the financial statements under ""Southern Company Gas"" for additional information.Revenues from infrastructure replacement programs and base rate changes increased in 2018 primarily due to a $48 million increase at Nicor Gas, partially offset by a $12 million decrease at Atlanta Gas Light. These amounts include gas distribution operations' continued investments recovered through infrastructure replacement programs and base rate increases less revenue reductions for the impacts of the Tax Reform Legislation. See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Southern Company Gas"" for additional information.Revenues increased due to colder weather in 2018 compared to 2017. See ""Heating Degree Days"" herein for additional information. Revenues from wholesale gas services increased in 2018 primarily due to increased commercial activity, partially offset by derivative losses. See ""Segment Information – Wholesale Gas Services"" herein for additional information.Other revenues increased in 2018 primarily due to a $15 million increase from the Dalton Pipeline being placed in service in August 2017 and a $14 million increase in Nicor Gas' revenue taxes.For the successor year ended December 31, 2017, natural gas revenues included recovery of $1.6 billion in cost of natural gas and $6 million in net revenues from wholesale gas services, net of $21 million of amortization associated with assets established in the application of acquisition accounting. Also included in natural gas revenues for the successor year ended December 31, 2017 were $99 million in additional revenues generated from gas distribution operations as a result of continued investment in infrastructure replacement programs and increases in base rate revenues at Atlanta Gas Light, Elizabethtown Gas, and Virginia Natural Gas. Natural gas revenues were partially offset by a $13 million negative impact of warmer-than-normal weather, net of hedging.For the successor period of July 1, 2016 through December 31, 2016, natural gas revenues included recovery of $613 million in cost of natural gas and $24 million in net revenues from wholesale gas services, net of $5 million of amortization associated with assets established in the application of acquisition accounting. Natural gas revenues were partially offset by a $5 million negative impact of warmer-than-normal weather, net of hedging.For the predecessor period of January 1, 2016 through June 30, 2016, natural gas revenues included recovery of $755 million in cost of natural gas and $32 million in net losses from wholesale gas services. Natural gas revenues were partially offset by a $7 million negative impact of warmer-than-normal weather, net of hedging.Natural gas distribution rates include provisions to adjust billings for fluctuations in natural gas costs. Therefore, gas costs recovered through natural gas revenues generally equal the amount expensed in cost of natural gas and do not affect net income from gas distribution operations. See ""Cost of Natural Gas"" herein for additional information. Revenue impacts from weather and customer growth are described further below.Heating Degree Days During Heating Season, natural gas usage and operating revenues are generally higher. Weather typically does not have a significant net income impact other than during the Heating Season. The following table presents the Heating Degree Days information for Illinois and Georgia, the primary locations where Southern Company Gas' operations are impacted by weather.II-175 Table of Contents Index to Financial StatementsMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company Gas and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual Report Years Ended December 31, 2018 vs. normal 2018 vs. 2017 2017 vs. 2016 Normal(*) 2018 2017 2016 colder colder colder (warmer) (in thousands) Illinois 5,813 6,101 5,246 5,243 5.0% 16.3% 0.1 %Georgia 2,539 2,588 1,970 2,175 1.9% 31.4% (9.4)%(*)Normal represents the 10-year average from January 1, 2008 through December 31, 2017 for Illinois at Chicago Midway International Airport and for Georgia at Atlanta Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport, based on information obtained from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, National Climatic Data Center.Southern Company Gas hedged its exposure to warmer-than-normal weather in Illinois for gas distribution operations and in Illinois and Georgia for gas marketing services.

See Note 15 to the financial statements under ""Southern Company Gas – Sale of Elizabethtown Gas and Elkton Gas"" and "" – Sale of Florida City Gas"" for additional information.(b)Includes customers in Ohio contracted through an annual auction process to serve for a 12-month period beginning April 1 of each year. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, there were approximately 70,000 and 140,000 contracted customers, respectively. At December 31, 2016, there were no contracted customers.Southern Company Gas anticipates overall customer growth trends at the remaining four natural gas distribution utilities in gas distribution operations to continue as it expects continued improvement in the new housing market and low natural gas prices. Southern Company Gas uses a variety of targeted marketing programs to attract new customers and to retain existing customers. Cost of Natural Gas Excluding Atlanta Gas Light, which does not sell natural gas to end-use customers, gas distribution operations charges its utility customers for natural gas consumed using natural gas cost recovery mechanisms set by the applicable state regulatory agencies. Under these mechanisms, all prudently-incurred natural gas costs are passed through to customers without markup, subject to regulatory review. Gas distribution operations defers or accrues the difference between the actual cost of natural gas and the amount of commodity revenue earned in a given period. The deferred or accrued amount is either billed or refunded to customers prospectively through adjustments to the commodity rate. Deferred natural gas costs are reflected as regulatory assets and accrued natural gas costs are reflected as regulatory liabilities. Therefore, gas costs recovered through natural gas revenues generally equal II-176 Table of Contents Index to Financial StatementsMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company Gas and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual Reportthe amount expensed in cost of natural gas and do not affect net income from gas distribution operations. Cost of natural gas at gas distribution operations represented 83.2% of the total cost of natural gas for 2018.Gas marketing services customers are charged for actual and estimated natural gas consumed. Cost of natural gas includes the cost of fuel and associated transportation costs, lost and unaccounted for gas, adjustments to reduce the value of inventories to market value, if applicable, and gains and losses associated with certain derivatives.For the successor year ended December 31, 2018, cost of natural gas was $1.5 billion, a decrease of $62 million, or 3.9%, compared to 2017 substantially all as a result of the Southern Company Gas Dispositions.For the successor year ended December 31, 2017, cost of natural gas was $1.6 billion, which reflected an increase in natural gas pricing of 26.3% compared to 2016, partially offset by lower demand for natural gas. For the successor period of July 1, 2016 through December 31, 2016 and the predecessor period of January 1, 2016 through June 30, 2016, cost of natural gas was $613 million and $755 million, respectively, which reflected low demand for natural gas driven by warm weather during those periods.Volumes of Natural Gas SoldThe following table details the volumes of natural gas sold during all periods presented.

See Note 15 to the financial statements under ""Southern Company Gas – Sale of Pivotal Home Solutions"" for additional information.Other Operations and Maintenance ExpensesFor the successor year ended December 31, 2018, other operations and maintenance expenses increased $36 million, or 3.8%, compared to the prior year. Excluding a $39 million decrease related to the Southern Company Gas Dispositions, other operations and maintenance expenses increased $75 million. This increase was primarily due to a $53 million increase in compensation and benefit costs, including a $12 million one-time increase for the adoption of a new paid time off policy to align with the Southern Company system, a $28 million increase in disposition-related costs, and an $11 million expense for a litigation settlement to facilitate the sale of Pivotal Home Solutions. These increases were partially offset by a $27 million decrease in bad debt expense primarily at Nicor Gas, which was offset by a decrease in revenues as a result of the related regulatory recovery mechanism. See Note 3 to the financial statements under ""General Litigation Matters – Southern Company Gas"" for additional information on the litigation settlement.For the successor year ended December 31, 2017 and the successor period of July 1, 2016 through December 31, 2016, other operations and maintenance expenses were $945 million and $480 million, respectively, and primarily reflected compensation and benefit costs and professional services, including pipeline compliance and maintenance and legal services.II-177 Table of Contents Index to Financial StatementsMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company Gas and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual ReportFor the predecessor period of January 1, 2016 through June 30, 2016, other operations and maintenance expenses were $452 million and included pipeline compliance and maintenance costs and compensation and benefit costs.Depreciation and AmortizationFor the successor year ended December 31, 2018, depreciation and amortization decreased $1 million, or 0.2%, compared to the prior year. Excluding a $37 million decrease related to the Southern Company Gas Dispositions, depreciation and amortization increased $36 million. This increase was primarily due to continued infrastructure investments at gas distribution operations, partially offset by lower amortization of intangible assets as a result of fair value adjustments in acquisition accounting at gas marketing services. For the successor year ended December 31, 2017, depreciation and amortization was $501 million and included $38 million of additional amortization of intangible assets as a result of fair value adjustments in acquisition accounting, primarily at gas marketing services, and $28 million in additional depreciation at gas distribution operations, primarily due to continued investment in infrastructure programs.For the successor period of July 1, 2016 through December 31, 2016, depreciation and amortization was $238 million and included $23 million of additional amortization of intangible assets as a result of fair value adjustments in acquisition accounting, primarily at gas marketing services, as well as depreciation at gas distribution operations due to continued investment in infrastructure programs.For the predecessor period of January 1, 2016 through June 30, 2016, depreciation and amortization was $206 million and reflected depreciation related to additional assets placed in service at gas distribution operations due to continued investment in infrastructure programs.See Notes 2 and 15 to the financial statements under ""Southern Company Gas – Infrastructure Replacement Programs and Capital Projects"" and ""Southern Company Merger with Southern Company Gas,"" respectively, for additional information on infrastructure programs and the application of acquisition accounting.Taxes Other Than Income TaxesFor the successor year ended December 31, 2018, taxes other than income taxes increased $27 million, or 14.7%, compared to the prior year. Excluding a $4 million decrease related to the Southern Company Gas Dispositions, taxes other than income taxes increased $31 million. This increase primarily reflects a $13 million increase in revenue tax expenses as a result of higher natural gas revenues, a $12 million increase in Nicor Gas' invested capital tax that reflects a $7 million credit in 2017 to establish a related regulatory asset, and a $4 million increase in property taxes.For the successor year ended December 31, 2017, the successor period of July 1, 2016 through December 31, 2016, and the predecessor period of January 1, 2016 through June 30, 2016, taxes other than income taxes were $184 million, $71 million, and $99 million, respectively, which consisted primarily of revenue tax expenses, property taxes, and payroll taxes.Goodwill ImpairmentFor the successor year ended December 31, 2018, a goodwill impairment charge of $42 million was recorded in contemplation of the sale of Pivotal Home Solutions. See Notes 1 and 15 to the financial statements under ""Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets and Liabilities"" and ""Southern Company Gas – Sale of Pivotal Home Solutions,"" respectively, for additional information.Gain on Dispositions, NetFor the successor year ended December 31, 2018, gain on dispositions, net was $291 million and was associated with the Southern Company Gas Dispositions. The income tax expense on these gains included income tax expense on goodwill not deductible for tax purposes and for which a deferred tax liability had not been recorded previously.Merger-Related ExpensesThere were no Merger-related expenses in the successor years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. For the successor period of July 1, 2016 through December 31, 2016, Merger-related expenses were $41 million, including $18 million in rate credits provided to the customers of Elizabethtown Gas and Elkton Gas as conditions of the Merger, $20 million for additional compensation-related expenses, and $3 million for financial advisory fees, legal expenses, and other Merger-related costs.II-178 Table of Contents Index to Financial StatementsMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company Gas and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual ReportFor the predecessor period of January 1, 2016 through June 30, 2016, Merger-related expenses were $56 million, including $31 million for financial advisory fees, legal expenses, and other Merger-related costs, and $25 million for additional compensation-related expenses.See Note 15 to the financial statements under ""Southern Company Merger with Southern Company Gas"" for additional information.Earnings from Equity Method InvestmentsFor the successor year ended December 31, 2018, earnings from equity method investments increased $42 million, or 39.6%, compared to the prior year. The increase was primarily due to higher earnings from Southern Company Gas' equity method investment in SNG from new rates effective September 2018 and lower operations and maintenance expenses due to the timing of pipeline maintenance.For the successor year ended December 31, 2017, earnings from equity method investments were $106 million, reflecting $88 million in earnings from Southern Company Gas' investment in SNG, including $33 million related to a non-cash charge recorded by SNG to establish a regulatory liability associated with the Tax Reform Legislation, and $18 million in earnings from all other investments. For the successor period of July 1, 2016 through December 31, 2016, earnings from equity method investments were $60 million, reflecting $56 million in earnings from Southern Company Gas' investment in SNG and $4 million in earnings from all other investments.For the predecessor period of January 1, 2016 through June 30, 2016, earnings from equity method investments were not material.See Notes 7 and 15 to the financial statements under ""Southern Company Gas – Equity Method Investments – SNG"" and ""Southern Company Gas – Investment in SNG,"" respectively, for additional information on Southern Company Gas' investment in SNG.Interest Expense, Net of Amounts CapitalizedFor the successor year ended December 31, 2018, interest expense, net of amounts capitalized increased $28 million, or 14.0%, compared to the prior year. The increase was primarily due to $21 million of additional interest expense related to new debt issuances and a $4 million reduction in capitalized interest primarily due to the Dalton Pipeline being placed in service in August 2017.For the successor year ended December 31, 2017, interest expense, net of amounts capitalized was $200 million, which includes the $38 million fair value adjustment on long-term debt in acquisition accounting. Interest expense also reflects debt issuances and redemptions during the period and the recognition of previously deferred interest related to regulatory infrastructure programs. For the successor period of July 1, 2016 through December 31, 2016, interest expense, net of amounts capitalized was $81 million, which includes the $19 million fair value adjustment on long-term debt in acquisition accounting. Interest expense also reflects debt issuances and redemptions during the period and the recognition of previously deferred interest related to regulatory infrastructure programs. For the predecessor period of January 1, 2016 through June 30, 2016, interest expense, net of amounts capitalized was $96 million, reflecting debt issuances and redemptions during the period and the recognition of previously deferred interest related to regulatory infrastructure programs.See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – ""Regulatory Matters – Unrecognized Ratemaking Amounts"" herein for additional information on the unrecognized costs related to the infrastructure programs. Also see FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY – ""Financing Activities"" herein and Note 8 to the financial statements for additional information on outstanding debt.Other Income (Expense), NetFor the successor year ended December 31, 2018, other income (expense), net decreased $43 million, or 97.7%, compared to the prior year. Excluding a $3 million decrease related to the Southern Company Gas Dispositions, other income (expense), net decreased $40 million. This decrease was primarily due to a $23 million increase in charitable donations and a $13 million decrease in gains from the settlement of contractor litigation claims. For the successor year ended December 31, 2017, other income (expense), net was $44 million and primarily related to a $20 million gain from the settlement of contractor litigation claims, $8 million of AFUDC, a $6 million tax gross-up on contributions II-179 Table of Contents Index to Financial StatementsMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company Gas and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual Reportin aid of construction, and $4 million of interest income. See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Southern Company Gas – PRP Settlement"" for additional information on contractor litigation claims.For the successor period of July 1, 2016 through December 31, 2016, other income (expense), net was $12 million and primarily related to the tax gross-up of contributions in aid of construction received from customers.For the predecessor period of January 1, 2016 through June 30, 2016, other income (expense), net was not material.Income TaxesFor the successor year ended December 31, 2018, income taxes increased $97 million, or 26.4%, compared to the prior year. Excluding a $329 million increase related to the Southern Company Gas Dispositions, including tax expense on the goodwill for which a deferred tax liability had not been previously provided, income taxes decreased $232 million. This decrease was primarily due to a lower federal income tax rate and the flowback of excess deferred taxes as a result of the Tax Reform Legislation. In addition, 2017 included additional tax expense of $130 million from the revaluation of deferred tax assets associated with the Tax Reform Legislation, the enactment of the State of Illinois income tax legislation, and new income tax apportionment factors in several states.For the successor year ended December 31, 2017, income taxes were $367 million. The effective tax rate in 2017 reflects additional expense from the revaluation of deferred tax assets of $93 million associated with the Tax Reform Legislation and $37 million associated with State of Illinois income tax legislation enacted in the third quarter 2017 and new income tax apportionment factors in several states resulting from Southern Company Gas' inclusion in the consolidated Southern Company state tax filings. For the successor period of July 1, 2016 through December 31, 2016 and the predecessor period of January 1, 2016 through June 30, 2016, income taxes were $76 million and $87 million, respectively. The effective tax rates during these periods reflect certain nondeductible Merger-related expenses.See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – ""Income Tax Matters"" herein and Note 10 to the financial statements for additional information.Effects of InflationSouthern Company Gas is subject to rate regulation that is generally based on the recovery of historical and projected costs. The effects of inflation can create an economic loss since the recovery of costs could be in dollars that have less purchasing power. Any adverse effect of inflation on Southern Company Gas' results of operations has not been substantial in recent years.Performance and Non-GAAP MeasuresPrior to the Merger, Southern Company Gas evaluated segment performance using EBIT, which includes operating income, earnings from equity method investments, and other income (expense), net. EBIT excludes interest expense, net of amounts capitalized and income taxes (benefit), which were evaluated on a consolidated basis for those periods. EBIT is used herein to discuss the results of Southern Company Gas' segments for the predecessor period as EBIT was the primary measure of segment profit or loss for that period. Subsequent to the Merger, Southern Company Gas changed its segment performance measure from EBIT to net income to better align with the performance measure utilized by Southern Company. EBIT for the successor periods presented herein is considered a non-GAAP measure. Southern Company Gas presents consolidated EBIT, which is considered a non-GAAP measure for all periods presented. The presentation of consolidated EBIT is believed to provide useful supplemental information regarding a consolidated measure of profit or loss. Southern Company Gas further believes the presentation of segment EBIT for the successor periods is useful as it allows for a measure of comparability to other companies with different capital and legal structures, which accordingly may be subject to different interest rates and effective tax rates. The applicable reconciliations of net income to consolidated EBIT and segment EBIT are provided herein.Adjusted operating margin is a non-GAAP measure that is calculated as operating revenues less cost of natural gas, cost of other sales, and revenue tax expense. Adjusted operating margin excludes other operations and maintenance expenses, depreciation and amortization, taxes other than income taxes, goodwill impairment, gain on dispositions, net, and Merger-related expenses, which are included in the calculation of operating income as calculated in accordance with GAAP and reflected in the statements of income. The presentation of adjusted operating margin is believed to provide useful information regarding the contribution resulting from base rate changes, infrastructure replacement programs and capital projects, and customer growth at gas distribution operations since the cost of natural gas and revenue tax expense can vary significantly and are generally billed directly to customers. Southern Company Gas further believes that utilizing adjusted operating margin at gas pipeline investments, wholesale gas services, and gas marketing services allows it to focus on a direct measure of performance before overhead costs. The applicable reconciliation of operating income to adjusted operating margin is provided herein.II-180 Table of Contents Index to Financial StatementsMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company Gas and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual ReportEBIT and adjusted operating margin should not be considered alternatives to, or more meaningful indicators of, Southern Company Gas' operating performance than net income attributable to Southern Company Gas or operating income as determined in accordance with GAAP. In addition, Southern Company Gas' adjusted operating margin may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.Detailed variance explanations of Southern Company Gas' financial performance are provided herein.Reconciliations of operating income to adjusted operating margin and net income attributable to Southern Company Gas to EBIT are as follows: Successor Predecessor Year Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, July 1, 2016 through December 31, January 1, 2016 through June 30, 2018 2017 2016 2016 (in millions) (in millions)Operating Income$915 $660 $199 $323Other operating expenses(a)1,443 1,630 830 813Revenue taxes(b)(111) (98) (31) (56)Adjusted Operating Margin$2,247 $2,192 $998 $1,080(a)Includes other operations and maintenance, depreciation and amortization, taxes other than income taxes, goodwill impairment, gain on dispositions, net, and Merger-related expenses.(b)Nicor Gas' revenue tax expenses, which are passed through directly to customers.

These agencies approve natural gas rates designed to provide Southern Company Gas with the opportunity to generate revenues to recover the cost of natural gas delivered to its customers and its fixed and variable costs, including depreciation, interest, operations and maintenance, taxes, and overhead costs, and to earn a reasonable return on its investments.With the exception of Atlanta Gas Light, Southern Company Gas' second largest utility that operates in a deregulated natural gas market and has a straight-fixed-variable rate design that minimizes the variability of its revenues based on consumption, the earnings of the natural gas distribution utilities can be affected by customer consumption patterns that are a function of weather conditions, price levels for natural gas, and general economic conditions that may impact customers' ability to pay for natural gas consumed. Southern Company Gas has various weather mechanisms, such as weather normalization mechanisms and weather derivative instruments, that limit its exposure to weather changes within typical ranges in its natural gas distribution utilities' service territories.II-182 Table of Contents Index to Financial StatementsMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company Gas and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual ReportOn July 1, 2018, a Southern Company Gas subsidiary, Pivotal Utility Holdings, completed the sales of the assets of two of its natural gas distribution utilities, Elizabethtown Gas and Elkton Gas, to South Jersey Industries, Inc. On July 29, 2018, Southern Company Gas and its wholly-owned direct subsidiary, NUI Corporation, completed the sale of Pivotal Utility Holdings, which primarily consisted of Florida City Gas, to NextEra Energy. See Note 15 to the financial statements under ""Southern Company Gas"" for additional information.2018 vs. 2017Net income decreased $19 million, or 5.4%, compared to the prior year, which includes a $40 million decrease in adjusted operating margin, a $299 million decrease in operating expenses, and a $22 million decrease in other income (expense), net resulting in a $237 million increase in EBIT. The decrease in net income also includes a $25 million increase in interest expense, net of amounts capitalized and a $231 million increase in income tax expense. Excluding a $90 million decrease attributable to the utilities sold during 2018, adjusted operating margin increased $50 million, which primarily reflects additional revenue from infrastructure investments and colder weather in 2018, partially offset by lower rates and revenue deferrals for regulatory liabilities associated with the Tax Reform Legislation impacts. Excluding a $391 million decrease attributable to the utilities sold during 2018 that includes the related gains on the sales, operating expenses increased $92 million. This increase reflects $40 million of additional depreciation primarily due to additional assets placed in service, $37 million of additional other operations and maintenance expenses primarily due to increased compensation and benefit costs, partially offset by a decrease in bad debt expense, and $15 million of additional taxes other than income taxes primarily due to a $12 million increase in Nicor Gas' invested capital tax. Excluding a $3 million decrease attributable to the utilities sold during 2018, other income (expense), net decreased $20 million, which primarily reflects a $13 million decrease in gains from the settlement of contractor litigation claims. The increase in interest expense reflects $14 million of additional interest expense primarily from the issuance of first mortgage bonds at Nicor Gas. Excluding a $290 million decrease attributable to the utilities sold in 2018, income tax expense decreased $59 million, primarily due to lower pretax earnings, a lower federal income tax rate, and the flowback of excess deferred taxes as a result of the Tax Reform Legislation.Successor Year Ended December 31, 2017Net income of $353 million includes $1.8 billion in adjusted operating margin, $1.2 billion in operating expenses, and $39 million in other income (expense), net, which resulted in EBIT of $684 million. Net income also includes $153 million in interest expense, net of amounts capitalized and $178 million in income tax expense. Adjusted operating margin reflects $99 million in additional revenue from continued investment in infrastructure replacement programs and base rate increases at Atlanta Gas Light, Elizabethtown Gas, and Virginia Natural Gas. Adjusted operating margin was also affected by increased customer growth, partially offset by the negative impact of warmer-than-normal weather, net of hedging. Operating expenses reflect a $28 million increase in depreciation associated with additional assets placed in service, as well as benefit and compensation costs, legal expenses, and pipeline compliance and maintenance expenses. Other income (expense), net reflects a $20 million gain from the settlement of contractor litigation claims. Interest expense reflects the impact of intercompany promissory notes executed in December 2016 and the issuance of first mortgage bonds at Nicor Gas in August 2017 and November 2017. Income tax expense includes a $22 million benefit as a result of the Tax Reform Legislation.See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Southern Company Gas – PRP Settlement"" for additional information on contractor litigation claims. See FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY – ""Financing Activities"" herein and Note 8 to the financial statements for additional information on debt issuances. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – ""Income Tax Matters"" herein and Note 10 to the financial statements for additional information.Successor Period of July 1, 2016 through December 31, 2016Net income of $77 million includes $817 million in adjusted operating margin, $592 million in operating expenses, and $8 million in other income (expense), net, resulting in EBIT of $233 million. Net income also includes $105 million in interest expense, net of amounts capitalized and $51 million in income tax expense.

The increase in commercial activity in 2018 compared to the prior year was primarily due to natural gas price volatility that was generated by favorable weather and a corresponding increase in power generation volumes coupled with decreased natural gas supply.Change in Storage and Transportation DerivativesVolatility in the natural gas market arises from a number of factors, such as weather fluctuations or changes in supply or demand for natural gas in different regions of the U.S. The volatility of natural gas commodity prices has a significant impact on Southern Company Gas' customer rates, long-term competitive position against other energy sources, and the ability of wholesale gas II-185 Table of Contents Index to Financial StatementsMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company Gas and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual Reportservices to capture value from locational and seasonal spreads. Forward storage or time spreads applicable to the locations of wholesale gas services' specific storage positions in 2018 resulted in storage derivative gains. Transportation and forward commodity losses in 2018 are primarily the result of widening transportation spreads due to favorable weather, which impacted forward prices at natural gas receipt and delivery points primarily in the Northeast and Midwest regions.The natural gas that Southern Company Gas purchases and injects into storage is accounted for at the LOCOM value utilizing gas daily or spot prices at the end of the year. A LOCOM adjustment, net of current period recoveries of $7 million, was recorded during 2018 and LOCOM adjustments for all other periods presented were immaterial. See Note 1 to the financial statements under ""Natural Gas for Sale"" for additional information.Withdrawal Schedule and Physical Transportation TransactionsThe expected natural gas withdrawals from storage and expected offset to prior hedge losses/gains associated with the transportation portfolio of wholesale gas services are presented in the following table, along with the net operating revenues expected at the time of withdrawal from storage and the physical flow of natural gas between contracted transportation receipt and delivery points. Wholesale gas services' expected net operating revenues exclude storage and transportation demand charges, as well as other variable fuel, withdrawal, receipt, and delivery charges, and exclude estimated profit sharing under asset management agreements. Further, the amounts that are realizable in future periods are based on the inventory withdrawal schedule, planned physical flow of natural gas between the transportation receipt and delivery points, and forward natural gas prices at December 31, 2018. A portion of wholesale gas services' storage inventory and transportation capacity is economically hedged with futures contracts, which results in the realization of substantially fixed net operating revenues.

The Southern Company Gas Dispositions are expected to materially decrease future earnings and cash flows to Southern Company Gas. For the year ended December 31, 2018, pre-tax earnings attributable to these dispositions were $297 million, which includes a $291 million gain on dispositions, net and a $42 million goodwill impairment. For the year ended December 31, 2017, net income attributable to these dispositions was $71 million, which included additional tax expense of $16 million associated with the Tax Reform Legislation. Due to the seasonal nature of the natural gas business and other factors including, but not limited to, weather, regulation, competition, customer demand, and general economic conditions, these results are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any other period. The level of Southern Company Gas' future earnings depends on numerous factors that affect the opportunities, challenges, and risks of Southern Company Gas' primary business of natural gas distribution and its complementary businesses in the gas pipeline investments, wholesale gas services, and gas marketing services sectors. These factors include Southern Company Gas' ability to maintain constructive regulatory environments that allow for the timely recovery of prudently-incurred costs, the completion and subsequent operation of ongoing infrastructure and other construction projects, creditworthiness of customers, its ability to optimize its transportation and storage positions, and its ability to re-contract storage rates at favorable prices. Future earnings will be driven by customer growth and are subject to a variety of other factors. These factors include weather, competition, new energy contracts with other utilities and other wholesale customers, energy conservation practiced by customers, the use of alternative energy sources by customers, the price of natural gas, the price elasticity of demand, and the rate of economic growth or decline in Southern Company Gas' service territories. Demand for natural gas is primarily driven by the pace of economic growth that may be affected by changes in regional and global economic conditions, which may impact future earnings.Volatility of natural gas prices has a significant impact on Southern Company Gas' customer rates, its long-term competitive position against other energy sources, and the ability of its gas marketing services and wholesale gas services segments to capture value from locational and seasonal spreads. Additionally, changes in commodity prices subject a significant portion of Southern Company Gas' operations to earnings variability. Over the longer term, volatility is expected to be low to moderate and locational and/or transportation spreads are expected to decrease as new pipelines are built to reduce the existing supply constraints in the shale areas of the Northeast U.S. To the extent these pipelines are delayed or not built, volatility could increase. See ""FERC Matters"" herein for additional information on permitting challenges experienced by the Atlantic Coast Pipeline. Additional economic factors may contribute to this environment, including a significant drop in oil and natural gas prices, which could lead to consolidation of natural gas producers or reduced levels of natural gas production. Further, if economic conditions continue to improve, the demand for natural gas may increase, which may cause natural gas prices to rise and drive higher volatility in the natural gas markets on a longer-term basis.As part of its business strategy, Southern Company Gas regularly considers and evaluates joint development arrangements as well as acquisitions and dispositions of businesses and assets. •On June 4, 2018, Southern Company Gas completed the stock sale of Pivotal Home Solutions to American Water Enterprises LLC.

Southern Company Gas and NextEra Energy entered into a transition services agreement whereby Southern Company Gas will provide certain administrative and operational services through no later than July 29, 2020.See OVERVIEW – ""Merger, Acquisition, and Disposition Activities"" herein and Note 15 to the financial statements under ""Southern Company Gas"" for additional information on these dispositions. See BUSINESS – ""Seasonality"" in Item 1, RISK FACTORS in Item 1A, and OVERVIEW – ""Seasonality of Results"" for additional information on seasonality.Environmental MattersSouthern Company Gas' operations are regulated by state and federal environmental agencies through a variety of laws and regulations governing air, water, land, and protection of other natural resources. Southern Company Gas maintains a comprehensive environmental compliance strategy to assess upcoming requirements and compliance costs associated with these environmental laws and regulations. The costs, including capital expenditures and operations and maintenance costs, required to comply with environmental laws and regulations may impact future results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition. A major portion of these compliance costs are expected to be recovered through customer rates. The ultimate impact of the environmental laws and regulations discussed herein will depend on various factors, such as state adoption and implementation of requirements and the outcome of pending and/or future legal challenges.New or revised environmental laws and regulations could affect many areas of Southern Company Gas' operations. The impact of any such changes cannot be determined at this time. Environmental compliance costs could affect earnings if such costs cannot continue to be recovered in rates on a timely basis. Further, increased costs that are recovered through regulated rates could contribute to reduced demand for natural gas, which could negatively affect results of operations, cash flows, and/or financial condition. Additionally, many commercial and industrial customers may also be affected by existing and future environmental requirements, which for some may have the potential to ultimately affect their demand for natural gas.Environmental RemediationSouthern Company Gas is subject to environmental remediation liabilities associated with 40 former MGP sites in four different states. Southern Company Gas conducts studies to determine the extent of any required cleanup and has recognized the costs to clean up known impacted sites in its financial statements. An accrued environmental remediation liability of $294 million was included in the balance sheets at December 31, 2018, of which $26 million is expected to be incurred over the next 12 months. The accrued environmental remediation liability decreased at December 31, 2018 primarily due to the disposition of $85 million that related to Elizabethtown Gas. The natural gas distribution utilities in Illinois and Georgia have received authority from their respective state regulators to recover approved environmental compliance costs through regulatory mechanisms, which covers substantially all of the total accrued remediation costs. See FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY – ""Capital Requirements and Contractual Obligations"" herein and Note 3 to the financial statements under ""Environmental Remediation"" for additional information.Water QualityIn 2015, the EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) jointly published a final rule that revised the regulatory definition of waters of the United States (WOTUS) for all Clean Water Act programs. The rule significantly expanded the scope of federal jurisdiction over waterbodies (such as rivers, streams, and canals), which could impact permitting and reporting requirements associated with the installation, expansion, and maintenance of pipeline projects. The EPA and the Corps are expected to publish a final rule in 2019 to replace the 2015 WOTUS definition. The impact of any changes to the 2015 WOTUS rule will depend on the content of this final rule and the outcome of any legal challenges.Global Climate IssuesThe EPA's GHG reporting rule requires annual reporting of GHG emissions expressed in terms of metric tons of CO2 equivalent emissions for a company's operational control of facilities. Based on ownership or financial control of facilities, Southern II-191 Table of Contents Index to Financial StatementsMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company Gas and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual ReportCompany Gas' 2017 GHG emissions were approximately 0.6 million metric tons of CO2 equivalent. The preliminary estimate of Southern Company Gas' 2018 GHG emissions on the same basis is approximately 0.6 million metric tons of CO2 equivalent.FERC MattersSouthern Company Gas is involved in two significant pipeline construction projects within gas pipeline investments. These projects, along with Southern Company Gas' existing pipelines, are intended to provide diverse sources of natural gas supplies to customers, resolve current and long-term supply planning for new capacity, enhance system reliability, and generate economic development in the areas served. The following table provides an overview of these pipeline projects. Miles of Pipe Capital Expenditures(a) Ownership Percentage (in millions) Atlantic Coast Pipeline(b)594 $350-390 5%PennEast Pipeline(c)118 $276 20%(a)Represents Southern Company Gas' expected total capital expenditures, excluding AFUDC, at completion, which may change.(b)In 2014, Southern Company Gas entered into a joint venture to construct and operate a natural gas pipeline that will run from West Virginia through Virginia and into eastern North Carolina to meet the region's growing demand for natural gas. The proposed pipeline project is expected to transport natural gas to customers in Virginia. In August 2017, the Atlantic Coast Pipeline received FERC approval.(c)In 2014, Southern Company Gas entered into a joint venture to construct and operate a natural gas pipeline that will transport low-cost natural gas from the Marcellus Shale area to customers in New Jersey. Southern Company Gas believes this will alleviate takeaway constraints in the Marcellus region and help mitigate some of the price volatility experienced during recent winters. On January 19, 2018, the PennEast Pipeline received FERC approval. Work continues with state and federal agencies to obtain the required permits to begin construction on the PennEast Pipeline. Any material delays may impact forecasted capital expenditures and the expected in-service date.The Atlantic Coast Pipeline has experienced challenges to its permits since construction began in 2018. During the third and fourth quarters 2018, a FERC stop work order, together with delays in obtaining permits necessary for construction and construction delays due to judicial actions, impacted the cost and schedule for the project. As a result, total project cost estimates have increased from between $6.0 billion and $6.5 billion to between $7.0 billion and $7.8 billion, excluding financing costs. Southern Company Gas' share of the total project costs is 5% and Southern Company Gas' investment at December 31, 2018 totaled $83 million. The operator of the joint venture currently expects to achieve a late 2020 in-service date for at least key segments of the Atlantic Coast Pipeline, while the remainder may extend into early 2021. Southern Company Gas has evaluated the recoverability of its investment and determined there was no impairment as of December 31, 2018. Abnormal weather, work delays (including due to judicial or regulatory action), and other conditions may result in additional cost or schedule modifications, which could result in an impairment of Southern Company Gas' investment and could have a material impact on Southern Company Gas' financial statements.The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time. See Notes 7 and 9 to the financial statements under ""Southern Company Gas – Equity Method Investments"" and ""Guarantees,"" respectively, for additional information on these pipeline projects.In August 2017, the Dalton Pipeline, which serves as an extension of the Transco pipeline system and provides additional natural gas supply to customers in Georgia, was placed in service. Southern Company Gas has a 50% ownership interest in the Dalton Pipeline. See Note 5 to the financial statements under ""Joint Ownership Agreements"" for additional information.On November 16, 2018, SNG completed its purchase of Georgia Power's natural gas lateral pipeline serving Plant McDonough Units 4 through 6 at net book value, as approved by the Georgia PSC on January 16, 2018. SNG expects to pay $142 million to Georgia Power in the first quarter 2020. During the interim period, Georgia Power will receive a discounted shipping rate to reflect the delayed consideration. Southern Company Gas' portion of the expected capital expenditures for the purchase of this pipeline and additional construction is $122 million.Regulatory MattersUtility Regulation and Rate DesignThe natural gas distribution utilities are subject to regulations and oversight by their respective state regulatory agencies. Rates charged to customers vary according to customer class (residential, commercial, or industrial) and rate jurisdiction. These agencies approve rates designed to provide the opportunity to generate revenues to recover all prudently-incurred costs, including a return on rate base sufficient to pay interest on debt and provide a reasonable ROE. Rate base generally consists of the original II-192 Table of Contents Index to Financial StatementsMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company Gas and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual Reportcost of the utility plant in service, working capital, and certain other assets, less accumulated depreciation on the utility plant in service and net deferred income tax liabilities, and may include certain other additions or deductions.The natural gas market for Atlanta Gas Light was deregulated in 1997. Accordingly, Marketers, rather than a traditional utility, sell natural gas to end-use customers in Georgia and handle customer billing functions. The Marketers file their rates monthly with the Georgia PSC. As a result of operating in a deregulated environment, Atlanta Gas Light's role includes:•distributing natural gas for Marketers;•constructing, operating, and maintaining the gas system infrastructure, including responding to customer service calls and leaks;•reading meters and maintaining underlying customer premise information for Marketers; and•planning and contracting for capacity on interstate transportation and storage systems.Atlanta Gas Light earns revenue by charging rates to its customers based primarily on monthly fixed charges that are set by the Georgia PSC and adjusted periodically. The Marketers add these fixed charges when billing customers. This mechanism, called a straight-fixed-variable rate design, minimizes the seasonality of Atlanta Gas Light's revenues since the monthly fixed charge is not volumetric or directly weather dependent.Georgia Rate Adjustment Mechanism (GRAM) In February 2017, the Georgia PSC approved GRAM and a $20 million increase in annual base rate revenues for Atlanta Gas Light, effective March 1, 2017. GRAM adjusts base rates annually, up or down, using an earnings band based on the previously approved ROE of 10.75% and does not collect revenue through special riders and surcharges. Atlanta Gas Light adjusts rates up to the lower end of the band of 10.55% and adjusts rates down to the higher end of the band of 10.95%. Various infrastructure programs previously authorized by the Georgia PSC under Atlanta Gas Light's STRIDE program including the Integrated Vintage Plastic Replacement Program (i-VPR) to replace aging plastic pipe and the Integrated System Reinforcement Program (i-SRP) to upgrade Atlanta Gas Light's distribution system and LNG facilities in Georgia continue under GRAM and the recovery of and return on the infrastructure program investments are included in annual base rate adjustments. The Georgia PSC reviews Atlanta Gas Light's performance annually under GRAM. See ""Rate Proceedings"" herein for additional information.Pursuant to the GRAM approval, Atlanta Gas Light and the staff of the Georgia PSC agreed to a variation of the Integrated Customer Growth Program to extend pipeline facilities to serve customers in areas without pipeline access and create new economic development opportunities in Georgia, which was formerly part of the STRIDE program. As a result, a new tariff was created, effective October 10, 2017, to provide up to $15 million annually for Atlanta Gas Light to commit to strategic economic development projects. Projects under this tariff must be approved by the Georgia PSC.PRPIn 2015, Atlanta Gas Light began recovering incremental PRP surcharge amounts through three phased-in increases in addition to its already existing PRP surcharge amount, which was established to address recovery of the unrecovered PRP balance of $144 million and the estimated amounts to be earned under the program through 2025. The unrecovered balance is the result of the continued revenue requirement earned under the program offset by the existing and incremental PRP surcharges. The under recovered balance at December 31, 2018 was $171 million, including $95 million of unrecognized equity return. The PRP surcharge will remain in effect until the earlier of the full recovery of the under recovered amount or December 31, 2025. See ""Rate Proceedings"" and ""Unrecognized Ratemaking Amounts"" herein for additional information.With the exception of Atlanta Gas Light, the earnings of the natural gas distribution utilities can be affected by customer consumption patterns that are largely a function of weather conditions and price levels for natural gas. Specifically, customer demand substantially increases during the Heating Season when natural gas is used for heating purposes. Southern Company Gas has various mechanisms, such as weather normalization mechanisms and weather derivative instruments, that limit exposure to weather changes within typical ranges in these utilities' respective service territories.With the exception of Atlanta Gas Light, the natural gas distribution utilities are authorized by the relevant regulatory agencies in the states in which they serve to use natural gas cost recovery mechanisms that adjust rates to reflect changes in the wholesale cost of natural gas and ensure recovery of all costs prudently incurred in purchasing natural gas for customers. Since Atlanta Gas Light does not sell natural gas directly to its end-use customers, it does not utilize a traditional natural gas cost recovery mechanism. However, Atlanta Gas Light does maintain natural gas inventory for the Marketers in Georgia and recovers the cost through recovery mechanisms approved by the Georgia PSC specific to Georgia's deregulated market. In addition to natural gas recovery mechanisms, there are other cost recovery mechanisms, such as regulatory riders, which vary by utility but allow recovery of certain costs, such as those related to infrastructure replacement programs as well as environmental remediation and II-193 Table of Contents Index to Financial StatementsMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company Gas and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual Reportenergy efficiency plans. In traditional rate designs, utilities recover a significant portion of the fixed customer service and pipeline infrastructure costs based on assumed natural gas volumes used by customers. With the exception of Nicor Gas, the utilities have decoupled regulatory mechanisms that Southern Company Gas believes encourage conservation by separating the recoverable amount of these fixed costs from the amounts of natural gas used by customers. Natural gas cost recovery revenues are adjusted for differences in actual recoverable natural gas costs and amounts billed in current regulated rates. Changes in the billing factor will not have a significant effect on Southern Company Gas' revenues or net income, but will affect cash flows. See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Southern Company Gas"" for additional information.The following table provides regulatory information for Southern Company Gas' natural gas distribution utilities: Nicor Gas Atlanta Gas Light Virginia Natural Gas Chattanooga GasAuthorized ROE(a)(b)9.80% 10.75% 9.50% 9.80%Weather normalization mechanisms(c) ü üDecoupled, including straight-fixed-variable rates(d) ü ü Regulatory infrastructure program rates(e)(f)ü ü Bad debt rider(g)ü ü üEnergy efficiency plan(h)ü ü Year of last rate decision(i)2018 2018 2018 2018(a)Represents the authorized ROE, or the midpoint of the authorized ROE range, at December 31, 2018.(b)The authorized ROE range for Atlanta Gas Light and Virginia Natural Gas was 10.55% - 10.95% and 9.00% - 10.00%, respectively, at December 31, 2018.(c)Regulatory mechanisms that allow recovery of costs in the event of unseasonal weather, but are not direct offsets to the potential impacts on earnings of weather and customer consumption.

Infrastructure Replacement Programs and Capital ProjectsSouthern Company Gas continues to focus on capital discipline and cost control while pursuing projects and initiatives that are expected to have current and future benefits to customers, provide an appropriate return on invested capital, and help ensure the safety and reliability of the utility infrastructure. In addition to capital expenditures recovered through base rates by each of the natural gas distribution utilities, Nicor Gas and Virginia Natural Gas have separate rate riders that provide timely recovery of capital expenditures for specific infrastructure replacement programs. Total capital expenditures incurred during 2018 for gas distribution operations were $1.4 billion, including $97 million related to Elizabethtown Gas, Elkton Gas, and Florida City Gas, which were sold in 2018. The following table and discussions provide updates on the infrastructure replacement programs and capital projects at the natural gas distribution utilities at December 31, 2018. These programs are risk-based and designed to update and replace cast iron, bare steel, and mid-vintage plastic materials or expand Southern Company Gas' distribution systems to improve reliability and meet operational flexibility and growth. The anticipated expenditures for these programs in 2019 are quantified in the discussion below.

Scope of program miles is an estimate and subject to change. Nicor GasIn 2013, Illinois enacted legislation that allows Nicor Gas to provide more widespread safety and reliability enhancements to its distribution system. The legislation stipulates that rate increases to customers as a result of any infrastructure investments shall not exceed a cumulative annual average of 4.0% or, in any given year, 5.5% of base rate revenues. In 2014, the Illinois Commission approved the nine-year regulatory infrastructure program, Investing in Illinois, subject to annual review. Nicor Gas expects to place into service $373 million of qualifying projects under Investing in Illinois in 2019.In conjunction with the base rate case order issued by the Illinois Commission on January 31, 2018, Nicor Gas is recovering program costs incurred prior to December 31, 2017 through base rates. Nicor Gas has requested that the program costs incurred subsequent to December 31, 2017, which are currently being recovered through a separate rider, be addressed in the base rate case filed November 9, 2018. See ""Rate Proceedings"" herein for additional information. Virginia Natural GasIn 2012, the Virginia Commission approved the SAVE program, an accelerated infrastructure replacement program, to be completed over a five-year period. In 2016, the Virginia Commission approved an extension to the SAVE program for Virginia Natural Gas to replace more than 200 miles of aging pipeline infrastructure and invest up to $30 million in 2016 and up to $35 million annually through 2021. Virginia Natural Gas expects to invest $35 million under this program in 2019.The SAVE program is subject to annual review by the Virginia Commission. In conjunction with the base rate case order issued by the Virginia Commission in December 2017, Virginia Natural Gas is recovering program costs incurred prior to September 1, 2017 through base rates. Program costs incurred subsequent to September 1, 2017 are currently recovered through a separate rider and are subject to future base rate case proceedings.Atlanta Gas LightAs discussed previously under ""Utility Regulation and Rate Design,"" i-SRP and i-VPR will continue under GRAM and the recovery of and return on current and future capital investments under the STRIDE program will be included in annual base rate adjustments. The orders for the STRIDE program provide for recovery of all prudent costs incurred in the performance of the program. Atlanta Gas Light will recover from end-use customers, through billings to Marketers, the costs related to the program, net of any related cost savings. The regulatory asset represents incurred program costs that will be collected through GRAM. The future expected costs to be recovered through rates related to allowed, but not incurred, costs are recognized in an unrecognized ratemaking amount that is not reflected on the balance sheets. This allowed cost is primarily the equity return on the capital investment under the program. See ""Unrecognized Ratemaking Amounts"" herein for additional information.Atlanta Gas Light capitalizes and depreciates the capital expenditure costs incurred from the STRIDE programs over the life of the assets. Operations and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. Recoveries, which are recorded as revenue, are based on a formula that allows Atlanta Gas Light to recover operations and maintenance costs in excess of those included in its current base rates, depreciation, and an allowed rate of return on capital expenditures. However, Atlanta Gas Light is allowed the recovery of carrying costs on the under recovered balance resulting from the timing difference.II-195 Table of Contents Index to Financial StatementsMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company Gas and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual ReportRate ProceedingsNicor GasOn January 31, 2018, the Illinois Commission approved a $137 million increase in annual base rate revenues, including $93 million related to the recovery of investments under the Investing in Illinois program, effective February 8, 2018, based on a ROE of 9.8%.On April 19, 2018, the Illinois Commission approved Nicor Gas' variable income tax adjustment rider. This rider provides for refund or recovery of changes in income tax expense that result from income tax rates that differ from those used in Nicor Gas' last rate case. Customer refunds, via bill credits, related to the impacts of the Tax Reform Legislation from January 25, 2018 through May 4, 2018 began on July 1, 2018 and are expected to conclude in the second quarter 2019. On May 2, 2018, the Illinois Commission approved Nicor Gas' rehearing request for revised base rates to incorporate the reduction in the federal income tax rate as a result of the Tax Reform Legislation. The resulting decrease of approximately $44 million in annual base rate revenues became effective May 5, 2018. Nicor Gas' previously-authorized capital structure and ROE of 9.80% were not addressed in the rehearing and remain unchanged. On November 9, 2018, Nicor Gas filed a general base rate case with the Illinois Commission requesting a $230 million increase in annual base rate revenues. The requested increase is based on a projected test year for the 12-month period ending September 30, 2020, a ROE of 10.6%, and an increase in the equity ratio from 52.0% to 54.0% to address the negative cash flow and credit metric impacts of the Tax Reform Legislation. The Illinois Commission is expected to rule on the requested increase within the 11-month statutory time limit, after which rate adjustments will be effective. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.Atlanta Gas LightOn February 23, 2018, Atlanta Gas Light revised its annual base rate filing to reflect the impacts of the Tax Reform Legislation and requested a $16 million rate reduction in 2018. On May 15, 2018, the Georgia PSC approved a stipulation for Atlanta Gas Light's annual base rates to remain at the 2017 level for 2018 and 2019, with customer credits of $8 million in each of July 2018 and October 2018 to reflect the impacts of the Tax Reform Legislation. The Georgia PSC maintained Atlanta Gas Light's previously authorized earnings band based on a ROE between 10.55% and 10.95% and increased the allowed equity ratio by 4% to an equity ratio of 55% to address the negative cash flow and credit metric impacts of the Tax Reform Legislation. Additionally, Atlanta Gas Light is required to file a traditional base rate case on or before June 1, 2019 for rates effective January 1, 2020.Atlanta Gas Light's recovery of the previously unrecovered PRP revenue through 2014, as well as the mitigation costs associated with the PRP that were not previously included in its rates, were included in GRAM. In connection with the GRAM approval, the last monthly PRP surcharge increase became effective March 1, 2017.Virginia Natural GasOn December 17, 2018, the Virginia Commission approved Virginia Natural Gas' annual information form filing, which reduced annual base rates by $14 million effective January 1, 2019 due to lower tax expense as a result of the lower corporate income tax rate and the impact of the flowback of excess deferred income taxes. This approval also requires Virginia Natural Gas to issue customer refunds, via bill credits, for the entire $14 million which was deferred as a regulatory liability, current, on the balance sheet at December 31, 2018. These customer refunds are expected to be completed in the first quarter 2019. Affiliate Asset Management AgreementsWith the exception of Nicor Gas, the natural gas distribution utilities use asset management agreements with an affiliate, Sequent, for the primary purpose of reducing utility customers' gas cost recovery rates through payments to the utilities by Sequent. For Atlanta Gas Light, these payments are controlled by the Georgia PSC and are utilized for infrastructure improvements and to fund heating assistance programs, rather than as a reduction to gas cost recovery rates. Under these asset management agreements, Sequent supplies natural gas to the utility and markets available pipeline and storage capacity to improve the overall cost of supplying gas to the utility customers. Currently, the natural gas distribution utilities primarily purchase their gas from Sequent. The purchase agreements require Sequent to provide firm gas to the natural gas distribution utilities, but these natural gas distribution utilities maintain the right and ability to make their own long-term supply arrangements if they believe it is in the best interest of their customers.Upon closing the sales of Elizabethtown Gas and Elkton Gas, an affiliate of South Jersey Industries, Inc. assumed the asset management agreements with wholesale gas services for Elizabethtown Gas and Elkton Gas. The sale of Pivotal Utility Holdings to NextEra Energy did not impact the asset management agreement between Sequent and Florida City Gas, which will remain in II-196 Table of Contents Index to Financial StatementsMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company Gas and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual Reporteffect until March 31, 2019. See Note 15 to the financial statements under ""Southern Company Gas "" for additional information on these dispositions.Each agreement provides for Sequent to make payments to the natural gas distribution utility through either an annual minimum guarantee within a profit sharing structure, a profit sharing structure without an annual minimum guarantee, or a fixed fee. From the inception of these agreements in 2001 through December 31, 2018, Sequent made sharing payments to the natural gas distribution utilities under these agreements totaling $425 million.The following table provides payments made by Sequent to the remaining natural gas distribution utilities under these agreements during the last three years: Successor Predecessor Year Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, July 1, 2016 through December 31, January 1, 2016 through June 30, 2018 2017 2016 2016 Expiration Date (in millions) (in millions) Virginia Natural Gas $11 $6 $2 $9 March 2019Atlanta Gas Light 9 4 1 6 March 2020Chattanooga Gas 1 1 — 1 March 2021Total(*) $21 $11 $3 $16 (*)Payments made to Elizabethtown Gas, Elkton Gas, and Florida City Gas, which were sold in July 2018, were $14 million and $12 million for the successor years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, $3 million for the successor period of July 1, 2016 through December 31, 2016, and $13 million for the predecessor period of January 1, 2016 through June 30, 2016. See Note 15 to the financial statements under ""Southern Company Gas"" for additional information on these dispositions.energySMARTThe Illinois Commission approved Nicor Gas' energySMART program, which includes energy efficiency program offerings and therm reduction goals. Through December 31, 2017, Nicor Gas spent $107 million of the initial authorized expenditure of $113 million. A new program began on January 1, 2018, with an additional authorized expenditure of $160 million through 2021. Through December 31, 2018, Nicor Gas had spent $29 million.Unrecognized Ratemaking AmountsThe following table illustrates Southern Company Gas' authorized ratemaking amounts that are not recognized on its balance sheets. These amounts are primarily composed of an allowed equity rate of return on assets associated with certain regulatory infrastructure programs. These amounts will be recognized as revenues in Southern Company Gas' financial statements in the periods they are billable to customers, the majority of which will be recovered by 2025. December 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 (in millions)Atlanta Gas Light$95 $104Virginia Natural Gas11 11Nicor Gas4 2Total$110 $117Income Tax MattersFederal Tax Reform LegislationIn December 2017, the Tax Reform Legislation was signed into law and became effective on January 1, 2018. The Tax Reform Legislation, among other things, reduced the federal corporate income tax rate to 21%, retained normalization provisions for public utility property and existing renewable energy incentives, and repealed the corporate alternative minimum tax. In addition, under the Tax Reform Legislation, net operating losses (NOL) generated after December 31, 2017 can no longer be carried back to previous tax years but can be carried forward indefinitely, with utilization limited to 80% of taxable income of the subsequent tax year. The projected reduction of Southern Company's consolidated income tax liability resulting from the tax rate reduction II-197 Table of Contents Index to Financial StatementsMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company Gas and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual Reportalso delays the expected utilization of existing tax credit carryforwards. See Note 10 to the financial statements for information on Southern Company's joint consolidated income tax allocation agreement.Following the enactment of the Tax Reform Legislation, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin 118 – ""Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act"" (SAB 118), which provided for a measurement period of up to one year from the enactment date to complete accounting under GAAP for the tax effects of the legislation. Due to the complex and comprehensive nature of the enacted tax law changes and their application under GAAP, Southern Company Gas considered all amounts recorded in the financial statements as a result of the Tax Reform Legislation ""provisional"" as discussed in SAB 118 and subject to revision prior to filing its 2017 tax return in the fourth quarter 2018. Southern Company Gas recognized tax benefits of $3 million and tax expense of $93 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively, for a total net tax expense of $90 million as a result of the Tax Reform Legislation. In addition, in total, Southern Company Gas recorded a $781 million increase in regulatory liabilities as a result of the Tax Reform Legislation and $4 million of stranded excess deferred tax balances in AOCI at December 31, 2017 were adjusted through retained earnings in 2018. As of December 31, 2018, Southern Company Gas considered the measurement of impacts from the Tax Reform Legislation on deferred income tax assets and liabilities, primarily due to the impact of the reduction of the corporate income tax rate, to be complete.However, the IRS continues to issue regulations that provide further interpretation and guidance on the law and each state's adoption of the provisions contained in the Tax Reform Legislation remains uncertain. In addition, the regulatory treatment of certain impacts of the Tax Reform Legislation is subject to the discretion of the FERC and the relevant state regulatory bodies. The ultimate impact of these matters cannot be determined at this time. See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Southern Company Gas – Rate Proceedings"" for additional information on the natural gas distribution utilities' rate filings to reflect the impacts of the Tax Reform Legislation. Also see FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY – ""Credit Rating Risk"" herein and Note 10 to the financial statements under ""Current and Deferred Income Taxes"" for additional information.Bonus DepreciationUnder the Tax Reform Legislation, projects with binding contracts prior to September 28, 2017 and placed in service after September 27, 2017 remain eligible for bonus depreciation under the PATH Act. The PATH Act allowed for 50% bonus depreciation for 2015 through 2017, 40% bonus depreciation for 2018, and 30% bonus depreciation for 2019 and certain long-lived assets placed in service in 2020. Based on provisional estimates, bonus depreciation is expected to result in positive cash flows of approximately $40 million for the 2018 tax year and approximately $20 million for the 2019 tax year. See Note 10 to the financial statements under ""Current and Deferred Income Taxes"" for additional information. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.Other MattersSouthern Company Gas is involved in various other matters being litigated and regulatory matters that could affect future earnings. In addition, Southern Company Gas is subject to certain claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business.Southern Company Gas is involved in litigation relating to an incident that occurred in one of its prior service territories that resulted in several deaths, injuries, and property damage. Southern Company Gas has resolved all claims for personal injuries or death, but it is continuing to defend litigation seeking to recover alleged property damages. Southern Company Gas has insurance that provides full coverage of the expected financial exposure in excess of $11 million per incident. During the successor period ended December 31, 2016, Southern Company Gas recorded reserves for substantially all of its potential exposure from these cases.The ultimate outcome of this matter and such pending or potential litigation or regulatory matters cannot be predicted at this time; however, for current proceedings not specifically reported herein or in Notes 2 and 3 to the financial statements, management does not anticipate that the ultimate liabilities, if any, arising from such current proceedings would have a material effect on Southern Company Gas' financial statements. See Notes 2 and 3 to the financial statements for a discussion of various other contingencies, regulatory matters, and other matters being litigated which may affect future earnings potential.Southern Company Gas owns a 50% interest in a LNG liquefaction and storage facility in Jacksonville, Florida, which was placed in service in October 2018. The facility, outfitted with a 2.0 million gallon storage tank with the capacity to produce in excess of 120,000 gallons of LNG per day, is not expected to have a material impact on Southern Company Gas' 2019 financial statements.A wholly-owned subsidiary of Southern Company Gas owns and operates a natural gas storage facility consisting of two salt dome caverns in Louisiana. Periodic integrity tests are required in accordance with rules of the Louisiana Department of Natural Resources (DNR). In August 2017, in connection with an ongoing integrity project, updated seismic mapping indicated the proximity of one of the caverns to the edge of the salt dome may be less than the required minimum and could result in Southern II-198 Table of Contents Index to Financial StatementsMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company Gas and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual ReportCompany Gas retiring the cavern early. At December 31, 2018, the facility's property, plant, and equipment had a net book value of $109 million, of which the cavern itself represents approximately 20%. A potential early retirement of this cavern is dependent upon several factors including compliance with an order from the Louisiana DNR detailing the requirements to place the cavern back in service, which includes, among other things, obtaining core samples to determine the composition of the sheath surrounding the edge of the salt dome.The cavern continues to maintain its pressures and overall structural integrity. Southern Company Gas intends to monitor the cavern and comply with the Louisiana DNR order through 2020 and place the cavern back in service in 2021. These events were considered in connection with Southern Company Gas' annual long-lived asset impairment analysis, which determined there was no impairment as of December 31, 2018. Any changes in results of monitoring activities, rates at which expiring capacity contracts are re-contracted, timing of placing the cavern back in service, or Louisiana DNR requirements could trigger impairment. Further, early retirement of the cavern could trigger impairment of other long-lived assets associated with the natural gas storage facility. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time, but could have a material impact on Southern Company Gas' financial statements.Effective January 1, 2018, Southern Company Gas conformed its paid time off policy to align with Southern Company. Under the new policy, paid time off days are vested by the employee on the first day of each year and will continue to be recovered through rates on an as-paid basis. As a result, Southern Company Gas accrued $21 million as of January 1, 2018, of which $9 million was recorded as regulatory assets by the natural gas distribution utilities. See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Southern Company Gas"" for additional information.ACCOUNTING POLICIESApplication of Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesSouthern Company Gas prepares its financial statements in accordance with GAAP. Significant accounting policies are described in Notes 1, 5, and 6 to the financial statements. In the application of these policies, certain estimates are made that may have a material impact on Southern Company Gas' results of operations and related disclosures. Different assumptions and measurements could produce estimates that are significantly different from those recorded in the financial statements. Senior management has reviewed and discussed the following critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of Southern Company's Board of Directors.Utility RegulationThe natural gas distribution utilities comprised approximately 82% of Southern Company Gas' total operating revenues for 2018 and are subject to rate regulation by their respective state regulatory agencies, which set the rates utilities are permitted to charge customers based on allowable costs, including a reasonable ROE. As a result, the natural gas distribution utilities apply accounting standards which require the financial statements to reflect the effects of rate regulation. Through the ratemaking process, the regulators may require the inclusion of costs or revenues in periods different than when they would be recognized by a non-regulated company. This treatment may result in the deferral of expenses and the recording of related regulatory assets based on anticipated future recovery through rates or the deferral of gains or creation of liabilities and the recording of related regulatory liabilities. The application of the accounting standards has a further effect on Southern Company Gas' financial statements as a result of the estimates of allowable costs used in the ratemaking process. These estimates may differ from those actually incurred by the natural gas distribution utilities; therefore, the accounting estimates inherent in specific costs such as depreciation and pension and other postretirement benefits have less of a direct impact on Southern Company Gas' results of operations and financial condition than they would on a non-regulated company.As reflected in Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Southern Company Gas – Regulatory Assets and Liabilities,"" significant regulatory assets and liabilities have been recorded. Management reviews the ultimate recoverability of these regulatory assets and any requirement to refund these regulatory liabilities based on applicable regulatory guidelines and GAAP. However, adverse legislative, judicial, or regulatory actions could materially impact the amounts of such regulatory assets and liabilities and could adversely impact Southern Company Gas' financial statements.Accounting for Income TaxesThe consolidated income tax provision and deferred income tax assets and liabilities, as well as any unrecognized tax benefits and valuation allowances, require significant judgment and estimates. These estimates are supported by historical tax return data, reasonable projections of taxable income, and interpretations of applicable tax laws and regulations across multiple taxing jurisdictions. The effective tax rate reflects the statutory tax rates and calculated apportionments for the many states in which Southern Company Gas operates.II-199 Table of Contents Index to Financial StatementsMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company Gas and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual ReportOn behalf of Southern Company Gas, Southern Company files a consolidated federal income tax return and various state income tax returns, some of which are combined or unitary. Under a joint consolidated income tax allocation agreement, each Southern Company subsidiary's current and deferred tax expense is computed on a stand-alone basis and no subsidiary is allocated more current expense than would be paid if it filed a separate income tax return. Certain deductions and credits can be limited at the consolidated or combined level resulting in NOL and tax credit carryforwards that would not otherwise result on a stand-alone basis. Utilization of NOL carryforwards and the assessment of valuation allowances are based on significant judgment and extensive analysis of Southern Company Gas', as well as Southern Company's, current financial position and result of operations, including currently available information about future years, to estimate when future taxable income will be realized.Current and deferred state income tax liabilities and assets are estimated based on laws of multiple states that determine the income to be apportioned to their jurisdictions. States utilize various formulas to calculate the apportionment of taxable income, primarily using sales, assets, or payroll within the jurisdiction compared to the consolidated totals. In addition, each state varies as to whether a stand-alone, combined, or unitary filing methodology is required. The calculation of deferred state taxes considers apportionment factors and filing methodologies that are expected to apply in future years. The apportionments and methodologies which are ultimately finalized in a manner inconsistent with expectations could have a material effect on Southern Company Gas' financial statements.Given the significant judgment involved in estimating NOL carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards and multi-state apportionments, Southern Company Gas considers state deferred income tax liabilities and assets to be critical accounting estimates.Assessment of AssetsGoodwillSouthern Company Gas does not amortize its goodwill, but tests it annually for impairment at the reporting unit level during the fourth quarter or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. These indicators include, but are not limited to, a significant change in operating performance, the business climate, legal or regulatory factors, or a planned sale or disposition of a significant portion of the business. A reporting unit is the operating segment, or a business one level below the operating segment (a component), if discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by management. Components are aggregated if they have similar economic characteristics.As part of Southern Company Gas' impairment test, Southern Company Gas may perform an initial qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit is less than its carrying amount before applying the quantitative goodwill impairment test. If Southern Company Gas elects to perform the qualitative assessment, it evaluates relevant events and circumstances, including but not limited to, macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, cost factors, financial performance, entity specific events, and events specific to each reporting unit. If Southern Company Gas determines that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, or it elects not to perform a qualitative assessment, it compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value to determine if the fair value is greater than its carrying value. Under ASU No. 2017-04, which was adopted effective January 1, 2018, any goodwill impairment loss will be measured as the excess of a reporting unit's carrying amount over its fair value.For the 2018 and 2016 annual impairment tests, Southern Company Gas performed the qualitative assessment and determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of all of its reporting units with goodwill exceeded their carrying amounts, and therefore no quantitative analysis was required. For the 2017 annual impairment test, Southern Company Gas performed the quantitative assessment, which resulted in the fair value of all of its reporting units that have goodwill exceeding their carrying value. In the first quarter 2018, Southern Company Gas recorded a $42 million impairment charge in contemplation of the sale of Pivotal Home Solutions. As the determination of an asset's fair value and useful life involves management making certain estimates and because these estimates form the basis for the determination of whether or not an impairment charge should be recorded, Southern Company Gas considers these estimates to be critical accounting estimates.See Note 1 to the financial statements under ""Recently Adopted Accounting Standards – Other"" for information on Southern Company Gas' adoption of ASU No. 2017-04.Long-Lived AssetsSouthern Company Gas depreciates or amortizes its long-lived and intangible assets over their estimated useful lives. Southern Company Gas assesses its long-lived and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset's carrying amount may not be recoverable. When such events or circumstances are present, Southern Company Gas II-200 Table of Contents Index to Financial StatementsMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company Gas and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual Reportassesses the recoverability of long-lived assets by determining whether the carrying value will be recovered through the expected future cash flows. Impairment is indicated if the carrying amount of a long-lived asset exceeds the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. If impairment is indicated, Southern Company Gas records an impairment loss equal to the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the long-lived asset.As the determination of the expected future cash flows generated from an asset, an asset's fair value, and useful life involves management making certain estimates and because these estimates form the basis for the determination of whether or not an impairment charge should be recorded, Southern Company Gas considers these estimates to be critical accounting estimates.See Notes 2 and 3 to the financial statements under ""FERC Matters – Southern Company Gas"" and ""Other Matters – Southern Company Gas,"" respectively, for information on certain assets recently evaluated for impairment.Derivatives and Hedging ActivitiesDetermining whether a contract meets the definition of a derivative instrument, contains an embedded derivative requiring bifurcation, or qualifies for hedge accounting treatment is complex. The treatment of a single contract may vary from period to period depending upon accounting elections, changes in Southern Company Gas' assessment of the likelihood of future hedged transactions, or new interpretations of accounting guidance. As a result, judgment is required in determining the appropriate accounting treatment. In addition, the estimated fair value of derivative instruments may change significantly from period to period depending upon market conditions, and changes in hedge effectiveness may impact the accounting treatment.Derivative instruments (including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts) are recorded on the balance sheets as either assets or liabilities measured at their fair value. If the transaction qualifies for, and is designated as, a normal purchase or normal sale, it is exempted from fair value accounting treatment and is, instead, subject to traditional accrual accounting. Southern Company Gas utilizes market data or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the derivative asset or liability, including assumptions about risk and the risks inherent in the inputs of the valuation technique.Changes in the derivatives' fair value are recognized concurrently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met. If the derivatives meet those criteria, derivative gains and losses offset related results of the hedged item in the income statement in the case of a fair value hedge, or gains and losses are recorded in OCI on the balance sheets until the hedged transaction affects earnings in the case of a cash flow hedge. Additionally, a company is required to formally designate a derivative as a hedge as well as document and assess the effectiveness of derivatives associated with transactions that receive hedge accounting treatment.Nicor Gas utilizes derivative instruments to hedge the price risk for the purchase of natural gas for customers. These derivatives are reflected at fair value and are not designated as accounting hedges. Realized gains or losses on such instruments are included in the cost of gas delivered and are passed through directly to customers, subject to review by the applicable state regulatory agencies, and therefore have no direct impact on earnings. Unrealized changes in the fair value of these derivative instruments are deferred as regulatory assets or liabilities. Prior to its disposition, Elizabethtown Gas utilized the same policy.Southern Company Gas uses derivative instruments primarily to reduce the impact to its results of operations due to the risk of changes in the price of natural gas and to a lesser extent Southern Company Gas hedges against warmer-than-normal weather and interest rates. The fair value of natural gas derivative instruments used to manage exposure to changing natural gas prices reflects the estimated amounts that Southern Company Gas would receive or pay to terminate or close the contracts at the reporting date, taking into account the current unrealized gains or losses on open contracts. For derivatives utilized at gas marketing services and wholesale gas services that are not designated as accounting hedges, changes in fair value are reported as gains or losses in Southern Company Gas' results of operations in the period of change. Gas marketing services records derivative gains or losses arising from cash flow hedges in OCI and reclassifies them into earnings in the same period that the underlying hedged item is recognized in earnings.Southern Company Gas classifies derivative assets and liabilities based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment and may affect the valuation of fair value assets and liabilities and their placement within the fair value hierarchy. The determination of the fair value of the derivative instruments incorporates various required factors. These factors include:•the creditworthiness of the counterparties involved and the impact of credit enhancements (such as cash deposits and letters of credit);•events specific to a given counterparty; and•the impact of Southern Company Gas' nonperformance risk on its liabilities.II-201 Table of Contents Index to Financial StatementsMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company Gas and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual ReportIf there is a significant change in the underlying market prices or pricing assumptions Southern Company Gas uses in pricing its derivative assets or liabilities, Southern Company Gas may experience a significant impact on its financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. See Note 14 to the financial statements for additional information.Given the assumptions used in pricing the derivative asset or liability, Southern Company Gas considers the valuation of derivative assets and liabilities a critical accounting estimate. See FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY – ""Market Price Risk"" herein for more information.Pension and Other Postretirement BenefitsSouthern Company Gas' calculation of pension and other postretirement benefits expense is dependent on a number of assumptions. These assumptions include discount rates, healthcare cost trend rates, expected long-term return on plan assets, mortality rates, expected salary and wage increases, and other factors. Components of pension and other postretirement benefits expense include interest and service cost on the pension and other postretirement benefit plans, expected return on plan assets, and amortization of certain unrecognized costs and obligations. Actual results that differ from the assumptions utilized are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, generally affect recognized expense and the recorded obligation in future periods. While Southern Company Gas believes that the assumptions used are appropriate, differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions would affect its pension and other postretirement benefit costs and obligations.Key elements in determining Southern Company Gas' pension and other postretirement benefit expense are the expected long-term return on plan assets and the discount rate used to measure the benefit plan obligations and the periodic benefit plan expense for future periods. The expected long-term return on pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets is based on Southern Company's investment strategy, historical experience, and expectations for long-term rates of return that consider external actuarial advice. Southern Company determines the long-term return on plan assets by applying the long-term rate of expected returns on various asset classes to Southern Company's target asset allocation. For purposes of determining Southern Company Gas' liability related to the pension and other postretirement benefit plans, Southern Company discounts the future related cash flows using a single-point discount rate developed from the weighted average of market-observed yields for high quality fixed income securities with maturities that correspond to expected benefit payments.A 25 basis point change in any significant assumption (discount rate, salary increases, or long-term rate of return on plan assets) would result in a $3 million or less change in total annual benefit expense, a $30 million or less change in the projected obligation for the pension plan, and a $6 million or less change in the projected obligation for other post retirement benefit plans.See Note 11 to the financial statements for additional information regarding pension and other postretirement benefits.Contingent ObligationsSouthern Company Gas is subject to a number of federal and state laws and regulations as well as other factors and conditions that subject it to environmental, litigation, and other risks. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL herein and Notes 2 and 3 to the financial statements for more information regarding certain of these contingencies. Southern Company Gas periodically evaluates its exposure to such risks and records reserves for those matters where a non-tax-related loss is considered probable and reasonably estimable. The adequacy of reserves can be significantly affected by external events or conditions that can be unpredictable; thus, the ultimate outcome of such matters could materially affect Southern Company Gas' results of operations, cash flows, or financial condition.Recently Issued Accounting StandardsSee Note 1 to the financial statements under ""Recently Adopted Accounting Standards"" for additional information.In 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) (ASU 2016-02). ASU 2016-02 requires lessees to recognize on the balance sheet a lease liability and a right-of-use asset for all leases. ASU 2016-02 also changes the recognition, measurement, and presentation of expense associated with leases and provides clarification regarding the identification of certain components of contracts that would represent a lease. The accounting required by lessors is relatively unchanged. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 and Southern Company Gas adopted the new standard effective January 1, 2019.Southern Company Gas elected the transition methodology provided by ASU No. 2018-11, Leases (Topic 842): Targeted Improvements, whereby the requirements of ASU 2016-02 are applied on a prospective basis as of the adoption date of January 1, 2019, without restating prior periods. Southern Company Gas elected the package of practical expedients provided by ASU 2016-02 that allows prior determinations of whether existing contracts are, or contain, leases and the classification of existing leases to continue without reassessment. Additionally, Southern Company Gas applied the use-of-hindsight practical expedient in determining lease terms as of the date of adoption and elected the practical expedient that allows existing land easements not previously accounted for as leases not to be reassessed. Southern Company Gas also made accounting policy elections to account II-202 Table of Contents Index to Financial StatementsMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company Gas and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual Reportfor short-term leases in all asset classes as off-balance sheet leases and combined lease and non-lease components in the computations of lease obligations and right-of-use assets for most asset classes.Southern Company Gas completed the implementation of a new application to track and account for its leases and updated its internal controls and accounting policies to support the accounting for leases under ASU 2016-02. Southern Company Gas completed its lease inventory and determined its most significant leases involve real estate and fleet vehicles. In the first quarter 2019, the adoption of ASU 2016-02 resulted in recording lease liabilities and right-of-use assets on Southern Company Gas' balance sheet each totaling $86 million, with no impact on Southern Company Gas' statement of income.FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY OverviewSouthern Company Gas' financial condition remained stable at December 31, 2018. Southern Company Gas' cash requirements primarily consist of funding ongoing operations, common stock dividends, capital expenditures, investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries, and debt maturities. Capital expenditures and other investing activities include investments to meet projected long-term demand requirements, to maintain existing natural gas distribution systems as well as to update and expand these systems, and to comply with environmental regulations. Operating cash flows provide a substantial portion of Southern Company Gas' cash needs. For the three-year period from 2019 through 2021, Southern Company Gas' projected common stock dividends, capital expenditures, and debt maturities are expected to exceed operating cash flows. Southern Company Gas plans to finance future cash needs in excess of its operating cash flows primarily through external securities issuances, equity contributions from Southern Company, and borrowings from financial institutions. Southern Company Gas plans to use commercial paper to manage seasonal variations in operating cash flows and other working capital needs. Southern Company Gas intends to continue to monitor its access to short-term and long-term capital markets as well as its bank credit arrangements to meet future capital and liquidity needs. See ""Sources of Capital,"" ""Financing Activities,"" and ""Capital Requirements and Contractual Obligations"" herein for additional information.By regulation, Nicor Gas is restricted, to the extent of its retained earnings balance, in the amount it can dividend or loan to affiliates and is not permitted to make money pool loans to affiliates. At December 31, 2018, the amount of subsidiary retained earnings restricted to dividend totaled $814 million. This restriction did not impact Southern Company Gas' ability to meet its cash obligations, nor does management expect such restriction to materially impact Southern Company Gas' ability to meet its currently anticipated cash obligations.Southern Company Gas' investments in the qualified pension plan decreased in value at December 31, 2018 as compared to December 31, 2017. There were no voluntary contributions to the qualified pension plan in 2018 and no mandatory contributions to its qualified pension plan are anticipated during 2019. See Note 11 to the financial statements for additional information.Net cash provided from operating activities in the successor year ended 2018 totaled $764 million, a decrease of $117 million from 2017. The decrease was primarily due to higher income tax payments as a result of net taxable gains from the Southern Company Gas Dispositions, partially offset by increased volumes of natural gas sold during 2018 as a result of colder weather compared to 2017. Net cash provided from operating activities totaled $881 million for 2017, primarily due to earnings and the timing of cash receipts for the sale of natural gas inventory and vendor payments. Net cash used for operating activities was $327 million for the successor period of July 1, 2016 through December 31, 2016, primarily due to a $125 million voluntary pension contribution, a $35 million payment for the settlement of an interest rate swap, and less cash due to the timing of collecting receivables and disbursing payables. Due to the seasonal nature of its business, Southern Company Gas typically reports negative cash flows from operating activities in the second half of the year. Net cash provided from operating activities was $1.1 billion for the predecessor period of January 1, 2016 through June 30, 2016, primarily due to low volumes of natural gas sales and changes in natural gas inventory as a result of warmer weather and the timing of recovery of related gas costs and weather normalization adjustments from customers.Net cash provided from investing activities for the successor year ended 2018 totaled $1.0 billion and was primarily due to the $2.6 billion proceeds from the Southern Company Gas Dispositions, partially offset by gross property additions primarily related to utility capital expenditures and pre-approved rider and infrastructure investments recovered through replacement programs at gas distribution operations as well as capital contributed to equity method pipeline investments partially offset by capital returned from equity method pipeline investments. Net cash used for investing activities totaled $1.6 billion for the successor year ended 2017, which reflected $1.5 billion in capital expenditures primarily due to gross property additions for infrastructure replacement programs at gas distribution operations and $145 million in capital contributions to equity method pipeline investments, partially offset by $80 million in capital returned from equity method pipeline investments. Net cash used for investing activities was $2.1 billion for the successor period of July 1, 2016 through December 31, 2016, which reflected II-203 Table of Contents Index to Financial StatementsMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company Gas and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual Report$1.4 billion primarily related to Southern Company Gas' acquisition of the 50% interest in SNG, and $632 million in capital expenditures. Net cash used for investing activities was $556 million for the predecessor period of January 1, 2016 through June 30, 2016 which primarily related to capital expenditures. See Note 7 to the financial statements under ""Southern Company Gas"" and Note 15 to the financial statements under ""Southern Company Gas – Investment in SNG"" for additional information.Net cash used for financing activities for the successor year ended 2018 of $1.8 billion included payments of common stock dividends to Southern Company, return of capital to Southern Company, redemptions of gas facility revenue bonds and senior notes, and repayments of commercial paper borrowings and long-term debt, partially offset by debt issuances and capital contributions from Southern Company. Net cash provided from financing activities totaled $741 million for 2017, primarily due to $850 million in debt issuances, $262 million in net additional commercial paper borrowings, and $103 million in capital contributions from Southern Company, partially offset by $443 million in common stock dividend payments to Southern Company and $22 million in repayment of long-term debt. Net cash provided from financing activities was $2.4 billion for the successor period of July 1, 2016 through December 31, 2016, which reflected $1.1 billion of capital contributions from Southern Company, primarily used to fund Southern Company Gas' investment in SNG, $1.1 billion in net additional commercial paper borrowings, partially offset by $160 million for the purchase of the 15% noncontrolling ownership interest in SouthStar, and $900 million in proceeds from debt issuances, partially offset by $420 million in debt payments. Net cash used for financing activities was $558 million for the predecessor period of January 1, 2016 through June 30, 2016, primarily due to $896 million in net repayment of commercial paper borrowings and $125 million in repayment of long-term debt, partially offset by $600 million in debt issuances. See Note 7 to the financial statements under ""Southern Company Gas"" and Note 15 to the financial statements under ""Southern Company Gas – Investment in SNG"" for additional information.Significant balance sheet changes at December 31, 2018 include $2.8 billion and $403 million in total assets and liabilities sold, respectively, associated with the Southern Company Gas Dispositions as described in Note 15 to the financial statements herein under ""Southern Company Gas."" After adjusting for these changes, other significant balance sheet changes included an increase of $1.0 billion in total property, plant, and equipment primarily due to capital expenditures for infrastructure replacement programs, a decrease of $73 million in accumulated deferred income tax liabilities primarily due to the change in the federal corporate income tax rate, partially offset by tax depreciation related to infrastructure assets placed in service, as well as the impacts of State of Illinois tax legislation, and a decrease of $108 million in long-term debt (including securities due within one year), primarily due to $200 million redemption of gas facility revenue bonds and $155 million in repayments of long-term debt, partially offset by the issuance of $300 million of first mortgage bonds at Nicor Gas. Other significant balance sheet changes include a decrease of $868 million in notes payable primarily related to a decrease in commercial paper borrowings of $840 million at Southern Company Gas Capital and $28 million at Nicor Gas. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – ""Income Tax Matters"" and FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY – ""Financing Activities"" herein and Notes 8 and 10 to the financial statements for additional information.Sources of Capital Southern Company Gas plans to obtain the funds to meet its future capital needs from sources similar to those used in the past, which were primarily from operating cash flows, external securities issuances, borrowings from financial institutions, and equity contributions from Southern Company. However, the amount, type, and timing of any future financings, if needed, depend upon prevailing market conditions, regulatory approval, and other factors. With respect to the public offering of securities, Southern Company Gas (excluding its subsidiaries) and Southern Company Gas Capital file registration statements with the SEC under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The issuance of securities by Nicor Gas is generally subject to the approval of the Illinois Commission.Southern Company Gas obtains separate financing without credit support from any affiliate in the Southern Company system. See Note 8 to the financial statements under ""Bank Credit Arrangements"" for additional information. The Southern Company system does not maintain a centralized cash or money pool. Therefore, except as described below, funds of Southern Company Gas are not commingled with funds of any other company in the Southern Company system.Southern Company Gas maintains commercial paper programs at Southern Company Gas Capital and Nicor Gas that consist of short-term, unsecured promissory notes. Nicor Gas' commercial paper program supports its working capital needs as Nicor Gas is not permitted to make money pool loans to affiliates. All of Southern Company Gas' other subsidiaries benefit from Southern Company Gas Capital's commercial paper program.At December 31, 2018, Southern Company Gas' current liabilities exceeded current assets by $469 million, primarily as a result of $650 million in notes payable and $357 million of securities due within one year. Southern Company Gas' current liabilities frequently exceed current assets because of commercial paper borrowings used to fund daily operations, scheduled maturities of long-term debt, and significant seasonal fluctuations in cash needs. II-204 Table of Contents Index to Financial StatementsMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company Gas and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual ReportAt December 31, 2018, Southern Company Gas had $64 million of cash and cash equivalents. Committed credit arrangements with banks at December 31, 2018 were as follows:Company Expires 2022 Unused (millions)Southern Company Gas Capital(a) $1,400 $1,395Nicor Gas 500 500Total(b) $1,900 $1,895(a)Southern Company Gas guarantees the obligations of Southern Company Gas Capital.(b)Pursuant to the credit arrangement, the allocations between Southern Company Gas Capital and Nicor Gas may be adjusted.See Note 8 to the financial statements under ""Bank Credit Arrangements"" for additional information.The multi-year credit arrangement of Southern Company Gas Capital and Nicor Gas (Facility) contains a covenant that limits the debt levels and contains a cross-acceleration provision to other indebtedness (including guarantee obligations) of the applicable company. Such cross-acceleration provision to other indebtedness would trigger an event of default of the applicable company if Southern Company Gas or Nicor Gas defaulted on indebtedness, the payment of which was then accelerated. At December 31, 2018, both companies were in compliance with such covenant. The Facility does not contain a material adverse change clause at the time of borrowings.Subject to applicable market conditions, the applicable company expects to renew or replace the Facility as needed, prior to expiration. In connection therewith, the applicable company may extend the maturity dates and/or increase or decrease the lending commitments thereunder. A portion of unused credit with banks provides liquidity support to Southern Company Gas. Southern Company Gas has substantial cash flow from operating activities and access to capital markets, including the commercial paper programs, and financial institutions to meet liquidity needs. Southern Company Gas makes short-term borrowings primarily through commercial paper programs that have the liquidity support of the committed bank credit arrangements described above. Short-term borrowings are included in notes payable in the balance sheets.II-205 Table of Contents Index to Financial StatementsMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company Gas and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual ReportDetails of short-term borrowings were as follows: Short-term Debt at the End of the Period Short-term Debt During the Period(*) AmountOutstanding Weighted Average Interest Rate AverageAmount Outstanding Weighted Average Interest Rate MaximumAmountOutstanding (in millions) (in millions) (in millions)Successor – December 31, 2018: Commercial paper: Southern Company Gas Capital $403 3.05% $489 2.25% $1,261Nicor Gas 247 2.98% 123 2.16% 275Short-term bank debt: Southern Company Gas Capital — —% 31 2.72% 276Total $650 3.03% $643 2.25% Successor – December 31, 2017: Commercial paper: Southern Company Gas Capital $1,243 1.73% $723 1.40% $1,243Nicor Gas 275 1.83% 176 1.12% 525Total $1,518 1.75% $899 1.35% Successor – December 31, 2016: Commercial paper: Southern Company Gas Capital $733 1.09% $461 0.79% $770Nicor Gas 524 0.95% 309 0.67% 587Total $1,257 1.03% $770 0.74% (*)Average and maximum amounts are based upon daily balances during the 12-month periods.Southern Company Gas believes that the need for working capital can be adequately met by utilizing commercial paper programs, lines of credit, and operating cash flows.Financing Activities The long-term debt on Southern Company Gas' balance sheets includes both principal and non-principal components. At December 31, 2018, the non-principal components totaled $456 million, including the amount attributable to long-term debt due within one year, which consisted of the unamortized portions of the fair value adjustment recorded in purchase accounting, debt premiums, debt discounts, and debt issuance costs.In December 2016, Southern Company Gas executed intercompany promissory notes to further allocate interest expense to its reportable segments that previously remained in the ""all other"" segment. These intercompany promissory notes allow Southern Company Gas to calculate net income, which is its performance measure subsequent to the Merger, at the segment level that incorporates the full impact of interest costs.Except as otherwise described herein, Southern Company Gas and its subsidiaries used the proceeds of debt issuances for their redemptions and maturities, to pay common stock dividends, to repay short-term indebtedness, for capital expenditures, and for general corporate purposes, including working capital.In January 2018, Southern Company Gas issued a floating rate promissory note to Southern Company in an aggregate principal amount of $100 million bearing interest based on one-month LIBOR. In March 2018, Southern Company Gas repaid this promissory note.Prior to its sale, in the second quarter 2018, Pivotal Utility Holdings caused $200 million aggregate principal amount of gas facility revenue bonds to be redeemed. Also in the second quarter 2018, Pivotal Utility Holdings, as borrower, and Southern Company Gas, as guarantor, entered into a $181 million short-term delayed draw floating rate bank term loan bearing interest II-206 Table of Contents Index to Financial StatementsMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company Gas and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual Reportbased on one-month LIBOR, which Pivotal Utility Holdings used to repay the gas facility revenue bonds. In July 2018, Pivotal Utility Holdings repaid this short-term loan.In May 2018, Southern Company Gas Capital borrowed $95 million pursuant to a short-term uncommitted bank credit arrangement, guaranteed by Southern Company Gas, bearing interest at a rate agreed upon by Southern Company Gas Capital and the bank from time to time and payable on no less than 30 days' demand by the bank. In July 2018, Southern Company Gas Capital repaid this loan.Nicor Gas issued $300 million aggregate principal amount of first mortgage bonds in a private placement, of which $100 million was issued in August 2018 and $200 million was issued in November 2018.In October 2018, Southern Company Gas Capital repaid at maturity $155 million aggregate principal amount of 3.50% Series B Senior Notes.In addition to any financings that may be necessary to meet capital requirements and contractual obligations, Southern Company Gas plans to continue, when economically feasible, a program to retire higher-cost securities and replace these obligations with lower-cost capital if market conditions permit.Credit Rating RiskSouthern Company Gas does not have any credit arrangements that would require material changes in payment schedules or terminations as a result of a credit rating downgrade.There are certain contracts that could require collateral, but not accelerated payment, in the event of a credit rating change below BBB- and/or Baa3. These contracts are for physical gas purchases and sales and energy price risk management. The maximum potential collateral requirement under these contracts at December 31, 2018 was $30 million.Generally, collateral may be provided by a Southern Company guaranty, letter of credit, or cash. Additionally, a credit rating downgrade could impact the ability of Southern Company Gas to access capital markets and would be likely to impact the cost at which it does so.On September 28, 2018, Fitch assigned a negative rating outlook to the ratings of Southern Company and certain of its subsidiaries (including Southern Company Gas, Southern Company Gas Capital, and Nicor Gas).As a result of the Tax Reform Legislation, certain financial metrics, such as the funds from operations to debt percentage, used by the credit rating agencies to assess Southern Company and its subsidiaries, including Southern Company Gas, may be negatively impacted. Southern Company Gas and its regulated subsidiaries have taken actions to mitigate the resulting impacts, which, among other alternatives, include adjusting capital structure. Absent actions by Southern Company and its subsidiaries that fully mitigate the impacts, Southern Company Gas', Southern Company Gas Capital's, and Nicor Gas' credit ratings could be negatively affected. The Georgia PSC's May 15, 2018 approval of a stipulation for Atlanta Gas Light's annual rate adjustment maintained the previously authorized earnings band and increased the equity ratio to address the negative cash flow and credit metric impacts of the Tax Reform Legislation. See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Southern Company Gas"" for information on additional rate proceedings for Nicor Gas and Atlanta Gas Light expected to conclude in 2019.Market Price RiskSouthern Company Gas is exposed to market risks, primarily commodity price risk, interest rate risk, and weather risk. Due to various cost recovery mechanisms, the natural gas distribution utilities of Southern Company Gas that sell natural gas directly to end-use customers have limited exposure to market volatility of natural gas prices. To manage the volatility attributable to these exposures, Southern Company Gas nets the exposures, where possible, to take advantage of natural offsets and enters into various derivative transactions for the remaining exposures pursuant to Southern Company Gas' policies in areas such as counterparty exposure and risk management practices. Southern Company Gas uses derivatives to buy and sell natural gas as well as for hedging purposes and mandates strict adherence to all applicable risk management policies. Derivative positions are monitored using techniques including, but not limited to, market valuation, value at risk, stress testing, and sensitivity analysis.Certain natural gas distribution utilities of Southern Company Gas manage fuel-hedging programs implemented per the guidelines of their respective state regulatory agencies to hedge the impact of market fluctuations in natural gas prices for customers. For the weather risk associated with Nicor Gas, Southern Company Gas has a corporate weather hedging program that utilizes weather derivatives to reduce the risk of lower adjusted operating margins potentially resulting from significantly warmer-than-normal weather. In addition, certain non-regulated operations routinely utilize various types of derivative instruments to economically hedge certain commodity price and weather risks inherent in the natural gas industry. These instruments include a variety of exchange-traded and OTC energy contracts, such as forward contracts, futures contracts, options contracts, and swap agreements. II-207 Table of Contents Index to Financial StatementsMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company Gas and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual ReportGas marketing services and wholesale gas services also actively manage storage positions through a variety of hedging transactions for the purpose of managing exposures arising from changing natural gas prices. These hedging instruments are used to substantially protect economic margins (as spreads between wholesale and retail natural gas prices widen between periods) and thereby minimize exposure to declining operating margins. Some of these economic hedge activities may not qualify, or may not be designated, for hedge accounting treatment. Southern Company Gas had no material change in market risk exposure for the year ended December 31, 2018 when compared to the year ended December 31, 2017.For the periods presented below, the changes in net fair value of derivative contracts were as follows: Successor Predecessor Year Ended December 31, 2018Year Ended December 31, 2017July 1, 2016 through December 31, 2016 January 1, 2016 through June 30,2016 (in millions) (in millions)Contracts outstanding at beginning of period, assets (liabilities), net$(106)$8$(54) $75Contracts realized or otherwise settled66(1)18 (77)Current period changes(a)(127)(113)48 (82)Contracts outstanding at end of period, assets (liabilities), net(167)(106)12 (84)Netting of cash collateral27719362 120Cash collateral and net fair value of contracts outstanding at end of period(b)$110$87$74 $36(a)Current period changes also include the changes in fair value of new contracts entered into during the period, if any.(b)Net fair value of derivative contracts outstanding excludes premium and intrinsic value associated with weather derivatives of $8 million and $11 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and includes premium and intrinsic value associated with weather derivatives of $4 million at December 31, 2016, and $5 million at June 30, 2016.The net hedge volume of energy-related derivative contracts for natural gas positions at December 31, 2018 and 2017 were as follows: 2018 2017 mmBtu Volume (in millions)Commodity – Natural gas 120 300Net Purchased / (Sold) Volume 120 300Southern Company Gas' derivative contracts are comprised of both long and short natural gas positions. A long position is a contract to purchase natural gas, and a short position is a contract to sell natural gas. The volume presented above represents the net of long natural gas positions of 4.16 billion mmBtu and short natural gas positions of 4.04 billion mmBtu at December 31, 2018 and the net of long natural gas positions of 3.51 billion mmBtu and short natural gas positions of 3.21 billion mmBtu at December 31, 2017.Energy-related derivative contracts that are designated as regulatory hedges relate primarily to Southern Company Gas' fuel-hedging programs. Therefore, gains and losses are initially recorded as regulatory liabilities and assets, respectively, and then are included in cost of natural gas as the underlying gas is used in operations and ultimately recovered through the respective cost recovery clause. Certain other gains and losses on energy-related derivatives, designated as cash flow hedges (which are mainly used to hedge anticipated purchases and sales), are initially deferred in OCI before being recognized in income in the same period as the hedged transaction. Gains and losses on energy-related derivative contracts that are not designated or fail to qualify as hedges are recognized in the statements of income as incurred.Some energy-related derivative contracts require physical delivery as opposed to financial settlement, and this type of derivative is both common and prevalent within the natural gas industry. When an energy-related derivative contract is settled physically, any cumulative unrealized gain or loss is reversed and the contract price is recognized in the respective line item representing the actual price of the underlying goods being delivered.II-208 Table of Contents Index to Financial StatementsMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company Gas and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual ReportSouthern Company Gas uses OTC contracts that are not exchange traded but are fair valued using prices which are market observable, and thus fall into Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. See Note 13 to the financial statements for further discussion of fair value measurements.The maturities of the energy-related derivative contracts at December 31, 2018 were as follows: Fair Value Measurements December 31, 2018 Maturity Total Fair Value Year 1 Years 2 & 3 Years 4 & 5 (in millions)Level 1(a)$(179) $(59) $(86) $(34)Level 2(b)12 37 — (25)Fair value of contracts outstanding at end of period(c)$(167) $(22) $(86) $(59)(a)Valued using NYMEX futures prices.(b)Valued using basis transactions that represent the cost to transport natural gas from a NYMEX delivery point to the contract delivery point. These transactions are based on quotes obtained either through electronic trading platforms or directly from brokers.(c)Excludes cash collateral of $277 million as well as premium and associated intrinsic value associated with weather derivatives of $8 million at December 31, 2018.Value at Risk (VaR)VaR is the maximum potential loss in portfolio value over a specified time period that is not expected to be exceeded within a given degree of probability. Southern Company Gas' VaR may not be comparable to that of other companies due to differences in the factors used to calculate VaR. Southern Company Gas' VaR is determined on a 95% confidence interval and a one-day holding period, which means that 95% of the time, the risk of loss in a day from a portfolio of positions is expected to be less than or equal to the amount of VaR calculated. The open exposure of Southern Company Gas is managed in accordance with established policies that limit market risk and require daily reporting of potential financial exposure to senior management. Because Southern Company Gas generally manages physical gas assets and economically protects its positions by hedging in the futures markets, Southern Company Gas' open exposure is generally mitigated. Southern Company Gas employs daily risk testing, using both VaR and stress testing, to evaluate the risk of its positions.Southern Company Gas actively monitors open commodity positions and the resulting VaR and maintains a relatively small risk exposure as total buy volume is close to sell volume, with minimal open natural gas price risk. Based on a 95% confidence interval and employing a one-day holding period, SouthStar's portfolio of positions for all periods presented was immaterial. For the periods presented below, wholesale gas services had the following VaRs: Successor Predecessor Year Ended December 31, 2018 Year Ended December 31, 2017July 1, 2016 through December 31, 2016 January 1, 2016 through June 30, 2016 (in millions) (in millions)Period end(*)$6.4$4.8$2.3 $1.9Average3.72.02.0 2.0High(*)11.74.82.8 2.5Low1.21.01.4 1.6(*)Increases in VaR at December 31, 2018 and 2017 were driven by significant natural gas price increases in Sequent's key markets. The natural gas price increase in 2018 was driven by an industry-wide lower-than-normal natural gas storage inventory position and colder-than-normal weather in the middle of fourth quarter 2018. The natural gas price increase in 2017 was driven by colder-than-normal weather. As weather and natural gas prices moderated subsequent to December 31, 2018 and 2017, VaR reduced to a level consistent with December 31, 2016.II-209 Table of Contents Index to Financial StatementsMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company Gas and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual ReportCredit RiskGas Distribution OperationsConcentration of credit risk occurs at Atlanta Gas Light for amounts billed for services and other costs to its customers, which consist of 15 Marketers in Georgia. The credit risk exposure to Marketers varies seasonally, with the lowest exposure in the non-peak summer months and the highest exposure in the peak winter months. Marketers are responsible for the retail sale of natural gas to end-use customers in Georgia. The functions of the retail sale of gas include the purchase and sale of natural gas, customer service, billings, and collections. The provisions of Atlanta Gas Light's tariff allow Atlanta Gas Light to obtain credit security support in an amount equal to a minimum of two times a Marketer's highest month's estimated bill from Atlanta Gas Light. For 2018, the four largest Marketers based on customer count, which includes SouthStar, accounted for 20% of Southern Company Gas' adjusted operating margin and 25% of gas distribution operations' adjusted operating margin.Several factors are designed to mitigate Southern Company Gas' risks from the increased concentration of credit that has resulted from deregulation. In addition to the security support described above, Atlanta Gas Light bills intrastate delivery service to Marketers in advance rather than in arrears. Atlanta Gas Light accepts credit support in the form of cash deposits, letters of credit/surety bonds from acceptable issuers, and corporate guarantees from investment-grade entities. On a monthly basis, a management risk oversight committee reviews the adequacy of credit support coverage, credit rating profiles of credit support providers, and payment status of each Marketer. Southern Company Gas believes that adequate policies and procedures are in place to properly quantify, manage, and report on Atlanta Gas Light's credit risk exposure to Marketers.Atlanta Gas Light also faces potential credit risk in connection with assignments of interstate pipeline transportation and storage capacity to Marketers. Although Atlanta Gas Light assigns this capacity to Marketers, in the event that a Marketer fails to pay the interstate pipelines for the capacity, the interstate pipelines would likely seek repayment from Atlanta Gas Light.Wholesale Gas ServicesSouthern Company Gas has established credit policies to determine and monitor the creditworthiness of counterparties, as well as the quality of pledged collateral. Southern Company Gas also utilizes netting agreements whenever possible to mitigate exposure to counterparty credit risk. When Southern Company Gas is engaged in more than one outstanding derivative transaction with the same counterparty and also has a legally enforceable netting agreement with that counterparty, the ""net"" mark-to-market exposure represents the netting of the positive and negative exposures with that counterparty and a reasonable measure of Southern Company Gas' credit risk. Southern Company Gas also uses other netting agreements with certain counterparties with whom it conducts significant transactions. Netting agreements enable Southern Company Gas to net certain assets and liabilities by counterparty. Southern Company Gas also nets across product lines and against cash collateral, provided the netting and cash collateral agreements include such provisions.Southern Company Gas may require counterparties to pledge additional collateral when deemed necessary. Southern Company Gas conducts credit evaluations and obtains appropriate internal approvals for a counterparty's line of credit before any transaction with the counterparty is executed. In most cases, the counterparty must have an investment grade rating, which includes a minimum long-term debt rating of Baa3 from Moody's and BBB- from S&P. Generally, Southern Company Gas requires credit enhancements by way of a guaranty, cash deposit, or letter of credit for transaction counterparties that do not have investment grade ratings. Certain of Southern Company Gas' derivative instruments contain credit-risk-related or other contingent features that could increase the payments for collateral it posts in the normal course of business when its financial instruments are in net liability positions. At December 31, 2018, for agreements with such features, Southern Company Gas' derivative instruments with liability fair values totaled $5 million for which Southern Company Gas had no collateral posted with derivatives counterparties to satisfy these arrangements.Southern Company Gas has a concentration of credit risk as measured by its 30-day receivable exposure plus forward exposure. At December 31, 2018, wholesale gas services' top 20 counterparties represented approximately 48%, or $298 million, of its total counterparty exposure and had a weighted average S&P equivalent credit rating of A-, all of which is consistent with the prior year. The S&P equivalent credit rating is determined by a process of converting the lower of the S&P or Moody's ratings to an internal rating ranging from 9 to 1, with 9 being equivalent to AAA/Aaa by S&P and Moody's, respectively, and 1 being D / Default by S&P and Moody's, respectively. A counterparty that does not have an external rating is assigned an internal rating based on the strength of the financial ratios of that counterparty. To arrive at the weighted average credit rating, each counterparty is assigned an internal ratio, which is multiplied by their credit exposure and summed for all counterparties. The sum is divided by the aggregate total counterparties' exposures, and this numeric value is then converted to a S&P equivalent.II-210 Table of Contents Index to Financial StatementsMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company Gas and Subsidiary Companies 2018 Annual ReportThe following table provides credit risk information related to Southern Company Gas' third-party natural gas contracts receivable and payable positions at December 31: Gross Receivables Gross Payables 2018 2017 2018 2017 (in millions) (in millions)Netting agreements in place: Counterparty is investment grade$461 $342 $255 $202Counterparty is non-investment grade5 20 95 25Counterparty has no external rating314 226 505 315No netting agreements in place: Counterparty is investment grade19 19 1 4Counterparty has no external rating2 — — —Amount recorded in balance sheets$801 $607 $856 $546Gas Marketing ServicesSouthern Company Gas obtains credit scores for its firm residential and small commercial customers using a national credit reporting agency, enrolling only those customers that meet or exceed Southern Company Gas' credit threshold. Southern Company Gas considers potential interruptible and large commercial customers based on reviews of publicly available financial statements and commercially available credit reports. Prior to entering into a physical transaction, Southern Company Gas also assigns physical wholesale counterparties an internal credit rating and credit limit based on the counterparties' Moody's, S&P, and Fitch ratings, commercially available credit reports, and audited financial statements.Capital Requirements and Contractual ObligationsSouthern Company Gas' capital investments are currently estimated to total $1.6 billion for 2019, $1.9 billion for 2020, $1.3 billion for 2021, $1.2 billion for 2022, and $1.3 billion for 2023. The regulatory infrastructure programs and other construction programs are subject to periodic review and revision, and actual costs may vary from these estimates because of numerous factors. These factors include: changes in business conditions; changes in FERC rules and regulations; state regulatory agency approvals; changes in legislation; the cost and efficiency of labor, equipment, and materials; project scope and design changes; and the cost of capital. In addition, there can be no assurance that costs related to capital expenditures will be fully recovered.In addition, as discussed in Note 11 to the financial statements, Southern Company Gas provides postretirement benefits to certain eligible employees and funds trusts to the extent required by the applicable state regulatory agencies.Funding requirements related to obligations associated with scheduled maturities of long-term debt, including the related interest; pipeline charges, storage capacity, and gas supply; operating leases; asset management agreements; financial derivative obligations; pension and other postretirement benefit plans; and other purchase commitments, primarily related to environmental remediation liabilities, are detailed in the contractual obligations table that follows.

Also see Notes 13 and 14 to the financial statements in Item 8 herein.II-15 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISSouthern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2019 Annual ReportOVERVIEWBusiness ActivitiesSouthern Company is a holding company that owns all of the common stock of three traditional electric operating companies, as well as the parent entities of Southern Power and Southern Company Gas, and owns other direct and indirect subsidiaries. The primary businesses of the Southern Company system are electricity sales by the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power and the distribution of natural gas by Southern Company Gas. Southern Company's reportable segments are the sale of electricity by the traditional electric operating companies, the sale of electricity in the competitive wholesale market by Southern Power, and the sale of natural gas and other complementary products and services by Southern Company Gas.•The traditional electric operating companies – Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and Mississippi Power – are vertically integrated utilities providing electric service to retail customers in three Southeastern states in addition to wholesale customers in the Southeast.•Southern Power develops, constructs, acquires, owns, and manages power generation assets, including renewable energy projects, and sells electricity at market-based rates in the wholesale market. Southern Power continually seeks opportunities to execute its strategy to create value through various transactions including acquisitions, dispositions, and sales of partnership interests, development and construction of new generating facilities, and entry into PPAs primarily with investor-owned utilities, IPPs, municipalities, electric cooperatives, and other load-serving entities, as well as commercial and industrial customers. In general, Southern Power commits to the construction or acquisition of new generating capacity only after entering into or assuming long-term PPAs for the new facilities.•Southern Company Gas is an energy services holding company whose primary business is the distribution of natural gas. Southern Company Gas owns natural gas distribution utilities in four states – Illinois, Georgia, Virginia, and Tennessee – and is also involved in several other complementary businesses. Southern Company Gas manages its business through four reportable segments – gas distribution operations, gas pipeline investments, wholesale gas services, which includes Sequent, a natural gas asset optimization company, and gas marketing services, which includes SouthStar, a provider of energy-related products and services to natural gas markets – and one non-reportable segment, all other. See Notes 7 and 16 to the financial statements for additional information.Many factors affect the opportunities, challenges, and risks of the Southern Company system's electric service and natural gas businesses. These factors include the ability to maintain constructive regulatory environments, to maintain and grow sales and customers, and to effectively manage and secure timely recovery of prudently-incurred costs. These costs include those related to projected long-term demand growth; stringent environmental standards, including CCR rules; safety; system reliability and resilience; fuel; natural gas; restoration following major storms; and capital expenditures, including constructing new electric generating plants and expanding and improving the electric transmission and electric and natural gas distribution systems.The traditional electric operating companies and natural gas distribution utilities have various regulatory mechanisms that address cost recovery. Effectively operating pursuant to these regulatory mechanisms and appropriately balancing required costs and capital expenditures with customer prices will continue to challenge the Southern Company system for the foreseeable future. See Note 2 to the financial statements for additional information.Southern Power's future earnings will depend upon the parameters of the wholesale market and the efficient operation of its wholesale generating assets, as well as Southern Power's ability to execute its growth strategy and to develop and construct generating facilities. In addition, Southern Power's future earnings will depend upon the availability of federal and state ITCs and PTCs on its renewable energy projects, which could be impacted by future tax legislation. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – ""Acquisitions and Dispositions,"" ""Construction Programs,"" and ""Income Tax Matters"" herein and Notes 10 and 15 to the financial statements for additional information.Southern Company's other business activities include providing energy solutions to electric utilities and their customers in the areas of distributed generation, energy storage and renewables, and energy efficiency. Other business activities also include investments in telecommunications, leveraged lease projects, and gas storage facilities. Management continues to evaluate the contribution of each of these activities to total shareholder return and may pursue acquisitions, dispositions, and other strategic ventures or investments accordingly.II-16 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2019 Annual ReportRecent DevelopmentsSouthern CompanyOn January 1, 2019, Southern Company completed the sale of Gulf Power to NextEra Energy for an aggregate cash purchase price of approximately $5.8 billion (less $1.3 billion of indebtedness assumed), including the final working capital adjustments. The gain associated with the sale of Gulf Power totaled $2.6 billion pre-tax ($1.4 billion after tax).Alabama PowerOn September 6, 2019, Alabama Power filed a petition for a CCN with the Alabama PSC for authorization to procure additional generating capacity through the turnkey construction of a new combined cycle facility and long-term contracts for the purchase of power from others, as well as the acquisition of an existing combined cycle facility for a total capital investment of approximately $1.1 billion. The related costs would be recovered through existing rate mechanisms. In addition, Alabama Power will pursue approximately 200 MWs of certain demand side management and distributed energy resource programs. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – ""Regulatory Matters – Alabama Power"" herein for additional information.Georgia PowerRate CaseOn December 17, 2019, the Georgia PSC voted to approve the 2019 ARP, including estimated rate increases totaling $342 million, $181 million, and $386 million effective January 1, 2020, January 1, 2021, and January 1, 2022, respectively. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – ""Regulatory Matters – Georgia Power – Rate Plans – 2019 ARP"" herein for additional information.Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 StatusIn 2009, the Georgia PSC certified construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 (with electric generating capacity of approximately 1,100 MWs each). Georgia Power holds a 45.7% ownership interest in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. In March 2017, the EPC Contractor filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. In December 2017, the Georgia PSC approved Georgia Power's recommendation to continue construction. The current expected in-service dates remain November 2021 for Unit 3 and November 2022 for Unit 4.In the second quarter 2018, Georgia Power revised its total project capital cost forecast to complete construction and start-up of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 to $8.4 billion (net of $1.7 billion received under the Guarantee Settlement Agreement and approximately $188 million in related customer refunds), with respect to Georgia Power's ownership interest. As of December 31, 2019, approximately $140 million of the $366 million construction contingency estimate established in the second quarter 2018 was allocated to the base capital cost forecast.As a result of the increase in the total project capital cost forecast and Georgia Power's decision not to seek rate recovery of the increase in the base capital costs, the holders of at least 90% of the ownership interests in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 were required to vote to continue construction. In September 2018, the Vogtle Owners unanimously voted to continue construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Following the vote to continue construction, Georgia Power entered into agreements to take certain actions which partially mitigate potential financial exposure for the other Vogtle Owners and to provide funding with respect to a MEAG Power wholly-owned subsidiary's ownership interest in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 under certain circumstances.As part of its ongoing processes, Southern Nuclear continues to evaluate cost and schedule forecasts on a regular basis to incorporate current information available, particularly in the areas of commodity installation, system turnovers, and workforce statistics. In February 2020, Southern Nuclear updated its cost and schedule forecast, which did not change the projected overall capital cost forecast and confirmed the expected in-service dates of November 2021 for Unit 3 and November 2022 for Unit 4.In March 2019, Georgia Power entered into the Amended and Restated Loan Guarantee Agreement with the DOE, under which the proceeds of borrowings may be used to reimburse Georgia Power for Eligible Project Costs incurred in connection with its construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, up to approximately $5.130 billion. At December 31, 2019, Georgia Power had a total of $3.8 billion of borrowings outstanding under the related multi-advance credit facilities.The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – ""Construction Programs – Nuclear Construction"" herein and Note 8 to the financial statements under ""Long-term Debt – DOE Loan Guarantee Borrowings"" for additional information.II-17 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2019 Annual ReportMississippi PowerIn 2019, Mississippi Power recorded pre-tax and after-tax charges to income of $24 million related to the Kemper County energy facility, which was suspended in 2017, primarily associated with the expected close out of a DOE contract related to the Kemper County energy facility, as well as other abandonment and related closure costs and ongoing period costs, net of salvage proceeds, for the mine and gasifier-related assets. The after-tax amount for 2019 includes an adjustment related to the tax abandonment of the Kemper IGCC following the filing of the 2018 tax return. In December 2019, Mississippi Power transferred ownership of the CO2 pipeline to an unrelated gas pipeline company, with no resulting impact on income. Mine reclamation activities are expected to be substantially completed in 2020 and dismantlement of the abandoned gasifier-related assets and site restoration activities are expected to be completed in 2024. The additional pre-tax period costs associated with dismantlement and site restoration activities, including related costs for compliance and safety, ARO accretion, and property taxes, are estimated to total $17 million in 2020, $15 million to $16 million annually in 2021 through 2023, and $5 million in 2024. See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Mississippi Power – Kemper County Energy Facility"" and Note 3 to the financial statements for additional information, including remaining contingencies related to the Kemper IGCC.On November 26, 2019, Mississippi Power filed a base rate case (Mississippi Power 2019 Base Rate Case) with the Mississippi PSC. The filing includes a requested annual decrease in Mississippi Power's retail rates of $5.8 million, or 0.6%, which is driven primarily by changes in the amortization rates of certain regulatory assets and liabilities and cost reductions, partially offset by an increase in Mississippi Power's requested return on investment and depreciation associated with the filing of an updated depreciation study. The revenue requirements included in the filing are based on a 53% average equity ratio and a 7.728% return on investment. On December 10, 2019, the Mississippi PSC suspended the base rate case filing through no later than March 25, 2020. If no further action is taken by the Mississippi PSC, the proposed rates may be effective beginning on March 26, 2020. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time. See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Mississippi Power – 2019 Base Rate Case"" for additional information.Southern PowerDuring 2019, Southern Power completed construction and achieved commercial operation of the 100-MW Wildhorse Mountain wind facility, acquired and continued construction of the 136-MW Skookumchuck wind facility, and continued construction of the 200-MW Reading wind facility. In addition, Southern Power acquired a majority interest in DSGP, an affiliate of Bloom Energy, that owns and operates fuel cell generation facilities, for a total purchase price of approximately $167 million.On June 13, 2019, Southern Power completed the sale of its equity interests in Plant Nacogdoches, a 115-MW biomass facility located in Nacogdoches County, Texas, to Austin Energy, for a purchase price of approximately $461 million, including working capital adjustments.On January 17, 2020, Southern Power completed the sale of its equity interests in Plant Mankato (including the 385-MW expansion unit completed in May 2019) to a subsidiary of Xcel for a purchase price of approximately $663 million, including estimated working capital adjustments.Southern Power calculates an investment coverage ratio for its generating assets, including those owned with various partners, based on the ratio of investment under contract to total investment using the respective generation facilities' net book value (or expected in-service value for facilities under construction) as the investment amount. With the inclusion of investments associated with the wind facilities currently under construction, as well as other capacity and energy contracts, and excluding Plant Mankato, which was sold on January 17, 2020, Southern Power's average investment coverage ratio at December 31, 2019 was 93% through 2024 and 90% through 2029, with an average remaining contract duration of approximately 14 years.See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – ""Acquisitions and Dispositions – Southern Power"" and Construction Programs – Southern Power"" herein for additional information.II-18 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2019 Annual ReportSouthern Company GasDuring 2019, the natural gas distribution utilities have been involved in the following regulatory proceedings:•On September 25, 2019, the Virginia Commission approved Virginia Natural Gas' Steps to Advance Virginia's Energy (SAVE) program request to amend and extend the program through 2024 with estimated capital spend totaling approximately $365 million.•On October 2, 2019, the Illinois Commission approved a $168 million annual base rate increase for Nicor Gas, including $65 million related to the recovery of investments under the Investing in Illinois program, which became effective October 8, 2019.•On December 19, 2019, the Georgia PSC approved a $65 million annual base rate increase for Atlanta Gas Light, effective January 1, 2020.See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – ""Regulatory Matters – Southern Company Gas – Rate Proceedings"" herein and Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Southern Company Gas – Rate Proceedings"" for additional information.Also during 2019, Southern Company Gas recorded a pre-tax impairment charge of $91 million ($69 million after tax) related to a natural gas storage facility in Louisiana.

These indicators include, but are not limited to, customer satisfaction, plant availability, electric and natural gas system reliability, and execution of major construction projects. In addition, Southern Company and the Subsidiary Registrants focus on earnings per share (EPS) and net income, respectively, as a key performance indicator. See RESULTS OF OPERATIONS herein for information on the Registrants' financial performance. See RESULTS OF OPERATIONS – ""Southern Company Gas – Operating Metrics"" for additional information on Southern Company Gas' operating metrics, including Heating Degree Days, customer count, and volumes of natural gas sold.The financial success of the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Company Gas is directly tied to customer satisfaction. Key elements of ensuring customer satisfaction include outstanding service, high reliability, and competitive prices. The traditional electric operating companies use customer satisfaction surveys to evaluate their results and generally target the top quartile of these surveys in measuring performance. Reliability indicators are also used to evaluate results. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – ""Regulatory Matters – Alabama Power – Rate RSE"" and "" – Mississippi Power – Performance Evaluation Plan"" herein for additional information on Alabama Power's Rate RSE and Mississippi Power's PEP rate plan, respectively, both of which contain mechanisms that directly tie customer service indicators to the allowed equity return.Southern Power continues to focus on several key performance indicators, including, but not limited to, the equivalent forced outage rate and contract availability to evaluate operating results and help ensure its ability to meet its contractual commitments to customers.II-19 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2019 Annual ReportRESULTS OF OPERATIONSSouthern CompanyConsolidated net income attributable to Southern Company was $4.7 billion in 2019, an increase of $2.5 billion, or 112.9%, from the prior year. The increase was primarily due to the $2.6 billion ($1.4 billion after tax) gain on the sale of Gulf Power in 2019 and a $1.1 billion ($0.8 billion after tax) charge in the second quarter 2018 for an estimated probable loss related to Georgia Power's construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. See ""Electricity Business – Estimated Loss on Plants Under Construction"" herein and Notes 2 and 15 to the financial statements under ""Georgia Power – Nuclear Construction"" and ""Southern Company,"" respectively, for additional information.Basic EPS was $4.53 in 2019 and $2.18 in 2018. Diluted EPS, which factors in additional shares related to stock-based compensation, was $4.50 in 2019 and $2.17 in 2018. EPS for 2019 and 2018 was negatively impacted by $0.11 and $0.04 per share, respectively, as a result of increases in the average shares outstanding. See Note 8 to the financial statements under ""Outstanding Classes of Capital Stock – Southern Company"" for additional information.Southern Company has paid dividends on its common stock since 1948. Dividends paid per share of common stock were $2.46 in 2019 and $2.38 in 2018. In January 2020, Southern Company declared a quarterly dividend of 62 cents per share. For 2019, the dividend payout ratio was 54% compared to 109% for 2018. The decrease was due to the increase in earnings in 2019.Discussion of Southern Company's results of operations is divided into three parts – the Southern Company system's primary business of electricity sales, its gas business, and its other business activities. 2019 2018 (in millions)Electricity business$3,268 $2,304Gas business585 372Other business activities886 (450)Net Income$4,739 $2,226Electricity BusinessSouthern Company's electric utilities generate and sell electricity to retail and wholesale customers.

The significant factors driving this change are shown in the preceding table. The increase in rates and pricing in 2019 was primarily due to the impacts of Alabama Power's customer bill credits issued in 2018 related to the Tax Reform Legislation, additional capital investments recovered through Rate CNP Compliance, and lower Rate RSE customer refund in 2019 as compared to the prior year; Georgia Power's higher contributions from commercial and industrial customers with variable demand-driven pricing, NCCR rate increase effective January 1, 2019, and pricing effects associated with a milder winter in 2019 compared to 2018; and Mississippi Power's PEP and ECO Plan rate increases effective for the first billing cycle of September 2018.Electric rates for the traditional electric operating companies include provisions to adjust billings for fluctuations in fuel costs, including the energy component of purchased power costs. Under these provisions, fuel revenues generally equal fuel expenses, including the energy component of PPA costs, and do not affect net income. The traditional electric operating companies each have one or more regulatory mechanisms to recover other costs such as environmental and other compliance costs, storm damage, new plants, and PPA capacity costs.See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Alabama Power,"" ""Georgia Power,"" and ""Mississippi Power"" for additional information. Also see ""Energy Sales"" below for a discussion of changes in the volume of energy sold, including changes related to sales growth (decline) and weather.Wholesale electric revenues consist of PPAs and short-term opportunity sales. Wholesale electric revenues from PPAs (other than solar and wind PPAs) have both capacity and energy components. Capacity revenues generally represent the greatest contribution to net income and are designed to provide recovery of fixed costs plus a return on investment. Energy revenues will vary depending on fuel prices, the market prices of wholesale energy compared to the Southern Company system's generation, demand for energy within the Southern Company system's electric service territory, and the availability of the Southern Company system's generation. Increases and decreases in energy revenues that are driven by fuel prices are accompanied by an increase or decrease in fuel costs and do not have a significant impact on net income. Energy sales from solar and wind PPAs do not have a capacity charge and customers either purchase the energy output of a dedicated renewable facility through an energy charge or through a fixed price related to the energy. As a result, the ability to recover fixed and variable operations and maintenance expenses is dependent upon the level of energy generated from these facilities, which can be impacted by weather conditions, equipment performance, transmission constraints, and other factors. Wholesale electric revenues at Mississippi Power include FERC-regulated MRA sales as well as market-based sales. Short-term opportunity sales are made at market-based rates that generally provide a margin above the Southern Company system's variable cost to produce the energy.Wholesale electric revenues from power sales were as follows: 2019 2018 (in millions)Capacity and other$529 $620Energy1,623 1,896Total$2,152 $2,516In 2019, wholesale revenues decreased $364 million, or 14.5%, as compared to the prior year due to decreases of $273 million in energy revenues and $91 million in capacity revenues. Excluding the $28 million decrease associated with the sale of Gulf Power, energy revenues decreased $165 million at Southern Power and $80 million at the traditional electric operating companies. The decrease at Southern Power related to a $113 million decrease primarily in non-PPA short-term sales and a decrease in the market price of energy, as well as a $51 million decrease primarily in sales under PPAs from natural gas facilities. The decrease at the traditional electric operating companies was primarily due to lower natural gas prices. Excluding the $26 million decrease associated with the sale of Gulf Power, the decrease in capacity revenues was primarily related to the sales of Southern Power's Plant Oleander and Plant Stanton Unit A (together, the Florida Plants) in December 2018 and Southern Power's Plant Nacogdoches in June 2019. See Note 15 to the financial statements for additional information.Other Electric RevenuesOther electric revenues decreased $28 million, or 4.2%, in 2019 as compared to the prior year. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease of $66 million related to the sale of Gulf Power, partially offset by increases at Georgia Power of $13 million in regulated power delivery construction and maintenance contracts and $11 million from outdoor lighting LED conversions and sales, as well as an increase at Alabama Power of $9 million from pole attachment agreements.II-22 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2019 Annual ReportEnergy SalesChanges in revenues are influenced heavily by the change in the volume of energy sold from year to year. KWH sales for 2019 and the percent change from the prior year were as follows: 2019 Adjusted(b) TotalKWHs Total KWHPercent Change Weather-AdjustedPercent Change(a) Total KWH Percent Change Weather-Adjusted Percent Change(a) (in billions) Residential48.5 (11.1)% (10.7)% (1.1)% (0.8)%Commercial49.1 (8.1) (8.6) (1.1) (1.6)Industrial50.1 (6.1) (6.1) (2.9) (2.9)Other0.8 (9.1) (9.0) (5.8) (5.7)Total retail148.5 (8.5) (8.4)% (1.7) (1.8)%Wholesale48.0 (3.9) (2.6) Total energy sales196.5 (7.4)% (1.9)% (a)Weather-adjusted KWH sales are estimated by removing from KWH sales the effect of deviations from normal temperature conditions, based on statistical models of the historical relationship between temperatures and energy sales. Normal temperature conditions are defined as those experienced in the applicable service territory over a specified historical period. This metric is useful because it allows trends in historical operations to be evaluated apart from the influence of weather conditions. Management also considers this metric in developing long-term capital and financial plans.(b)Kilowatt-hour sales comparisons to the prior year were significantly impacted by the disposition of Gulf Power on January 1, 2019. These changes exclude Gulf Power.Changes in retail energy sales are generally the result of changes in electricity usage by customers, changes in weather, and changes in the number of customers. Excluding the impact of the Gulf Power disposition on January 1, 2019, weather-adjusted retail energy sales decreased 2.7 billion KWHs in 2019 as compared to the prior year primarily due to lower customer usage. Weather-adjusted residential usage decreases are primarily attributable to an increase in energy-efficient residential appliances and energy saving initiatives, partially offset by customer growth. Weather-adjusted commercial usage decreases are primarily attributable to an increase in energy saving initiatives and an ongoing migration to the electronic commerce business model. Industrial usage decreases are a result of changes in production levels primarily in the primary metals, paper, chemicals, and textiles sectors.See ""Electric Operating Revenues"" above for a discussion of significant changes in wholesale revenues related to changes in price and KWH sales.Other RevenuesOther revenues increased $54 million, or 32.0%, in 2019 as compared to the prior year. The increase was primarily due to increases at Georgia Power of $20 million from unregulated sales associated with new energy conservation projects and $14 million from unregulated power delivery construction and maintenance contracts, as well as an increase at Alabama Power of $11 million in unregulated sales of products and services.Fuel and Purchased Power ExpensesThe mix of fuel sources for the generation of electricity is determined primarily by demand, the unit cost of fuel consumed, and the availability of generating units. Additionally, the electric utilities purchase a portion of their electricity needs from the wholesale market.II-23 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2019 Annual ReportDetails of the Southern Company system's generation and purchased power were as follows: 2019 2018(a)Total generation (in billions of KWHs)187 191Total purchased power (in billions of KWHs)18 14Sources of generation (percent) — Gas52 48Coal22 27Nuclear16 16Hydro3 3Other7 6Cost of fuel, generated (in cents per net KWH) — Gas2.36 2.76Coal2.87 2.93Nuclear0.79 0.80Average cost of fuel, generated (in cents per net KWH)2.20 2.46Average cost of purchased power (in cents per net KWH)(b)5.01 5.94(a)Excludes Gulf Power, which was sold on January 1, 2019.(b)Average cost of purchased power includes fuel purchased by the Southern Company system for tolling agreements where power is generated by the provider.In 2019, total fuel and purchased power expenses were $4.4 billion, a decrease of $1.2 billion, or 20.9%, as compared to the prior year. Excluding approximately $511 million associated with the sale of Gulf Power, the decrease was primarily the result of a $575 million decrease in the average cost of fuel and purchased power and an $84 million net decrease in the volume of KWHs generated and purchased.Fuel and purchased power energy transactions at the traditional electric operating companies are generally offset by fuel revenues and do not have a significant impact on net income. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – ""Regulatory Matters"" herein for additional information. Fuel expenses incurred under Southern Power's PPAs are generally the responsibility of the counterparties and do not significantly impact net income.FuelIn 2019, fuel expense was $3.6 billion, a decrease of $1.0 billion, or 21.9%, as compared to the prior year. Excluding approximately $309 million related to Gulf Power in 2018, the decrease was primarily due to an 18.1% decrease in the volume of KWHs generated by coal, a 14.5% decrease in the average cost of natural gas per KWH generated, and a 2.1% decrease in the average cost of coal per KWH generated, partially offset by a 5.0% increase in the volume of KWHs generated by natural gas.Purchased PowerIn 2019, purchased power expense was $816 million, a decrease of $155 million, or 16.0%, as compared to the prior year. Excluding approximately $202 million associated with the sale of Gulf Power, the change was primarily due to a 9.6% increase in the volume of KWHs purchased, partially offset by a 15.7% decrease in the average cost of KWH purchased.Energy purchases will vary depending on demand for energy within the Southern Company system's electric service territory, the market prices of wholesale energy as compared to the cost of the Southern Company system's generation, and the availability of the Southern Company system's generation.Other Operations and Maintenance ExpensesOther operations and maintenance expenses decreased $156 million, or 3.4%, in 2019 as compared to the prior year. The decrease reflects approximately $356 million related to Gulf Power in 2018 and $17 million related to the dispositions of Southern Power's Florida Plants and Plant Nacogdoches, partially offset by additional accruals of $123 million to the NDR at Alabama Power, $21 million of increased transmission and distribution expenses primarily due to overhead line maintenance and vegetation management at the traditional electric operating companies, $18 million from costs associated with unregulated sales at Georgia Power primarily associated with new energy conservation projects and power delivery construction and maintenance contracts, and $16 million related to an adjustment for FERC fees at Georgia Power following the conclusion of a multi-year audit of II-24 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2019 Annual Reportheadwater benefits associated with hydro facilities. See Notes 2 and 15 to the financial statements under ""Alabama Power – Rate NDR"" and ""Southern Power – Sales of Natural Gas and Biomass Plants,"" respectively, for additional information.Depreciation and AmortizationDepreciation and amortization decreased $93 million, or 3.6%, in 2019 as compared to the prior year. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease of $191 million related to Gulf Power in 2018, partially offset by an increase in depreciation of $62 million primarily resulting from additional plant in service and an increase in the amortization of regulatory assets of $47 million primarily at Mississippi Power and Georgia Power. See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Southern Company – Regulatory Assets and Liabilities"" and Note 5 to the financial statements under ""Depreciation and Amortization"" for additional information.Taxes Other Than Income TaxesTaxes other than income taxes decreased $87 million, or 7.9%, in 2019 as compared to the prior year primarily due to a decrease of $118 million related to the sale of Gulf Power, partially offset by higher property taxes of $30 million primarily at Georgia Power.Estimated Loss on Plants Under ConstructionThe $1.1 billion charge in 2018 reflects Georgia Power's revised estimate to complete construction and start-up of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. The 2019 charges of $24 million were associated with abandonment and closure activities for the mine and gasifier-related assets of the Kemper IGCC at Mississippi Power, net of sales proceeds. See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Georgia Power – Nuclear Construction"" and ""Mississippi Power – Kemper County Energy Facility"" for additional information.Impairment ChargesIn the second quarter 2018, Southern Power recorded a $119 million asset impairment charge related to the sale of the Florida Plants and in the third quarter 2018 recorded a $36 million asset impairment charge on wind turbine equipment held for development projects. Asset impairment charges recorded in 2019 were immaterial. See Note 15 to the financial statements under ""Southern Power – Sales of Natural Gas and Biomass Plants"" and "" – Development Projects"" for additional information.(Gain) Loss on Dispositions, NetGain on dispositions, net increased $21 million in 2019 as compared to the prior year primarily due to Southern Power's sale of Plant Nacogdoches in the second quarter 2019. See Note 15 to the financial statements under ""Southern Power – Sales of Natural Gas and Biomass Plants"" for additional information.Interest Expense, Net of Amounts CapitalizedInterest expense, net of amounts capitalized decreased $48 million, or 4.6%, in 2019 as compared to the prior year primarily related to the sale of Gulf Power.Other Income (Expense), NetOther income (expense), net increased $90 million, or 62.5%, in 2019 as compared to the prior year primarily due to a $36 million gain arising from the Roserock solar facility litigation settlement at Southern Power in 2019, $37 million from decreased charitable donations in 2019 at the traditional electric operating companies, $23 million of increased non-service cost-related retirement benefits income, and $16 million of increased interest income primarily associated with a new tolling arrangement accounted for as a sales-type lease at Mississippi Power as well as temporary cash investments, primarily at Alabama Power. These increases were partially offset by $24 million related to the settlement of Mississippi Power's Deepwater Horizon claim in 2018 and a $14 million gain from a joint-development wind project at Southern Power in 2018 attributable to its partner in the project. See Note 3 to the financial statements under ""General Litigation Matters – Southern Power"" and ""Other Matters – Mississippi Power"" and Note 11 to the financial statements under ""Pension Plans"" for additional information.Income TaxesIncome taxes increased $501 million, or 242.0%, in 2019 as compared to the prior year. Excluding an income tax benefit of approximately $20 million related to Gulf Power in 2018, income taxes increased $481 million. The increase was primarily due to increases in pre-tax earnings, including the $1.1 billion charge in 2018 associated with Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 construction at Georgia Power. See Notes 10 and 15 to the financial statements for additional information.II-25 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2019 Annual ReportNet Income Attributable to Noncontrolling InterestsSubstantially all noncontrolling interests relate to renewable projects at Southern Power. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests decreased $69 million, or 116.9%, in 2019, as compared to the prior year. The decrease was primarily due to $92 million of losses attributable to noncontrolling interests related to the tax equity partnerships entered into in 2018 and $14 million attributable to a joint-development wind project in 2018, partially offset by an allocation of approximately $29 million of income to the noncontrolling interest partner related to the Roserock solar facility litigation settlement. See Note 3 to the financial statements under ""General Litigation Matters – Southern Power"" and Note 7 to the financial statements under ""Southern Power"" for additional information regarding the litigation settlement and tax equity partnerships, respectively.Gas BusinessSouthern Company Gas distributes natural gas through utilities in four states and is involved in several other complementary businesses including gas pipeline investments, wholesale gas services, and gas marketing services.A condensed statement of income for the gas business follows: 2019 Increase(Decrease)from 2018 (in millions)Operating revenues$3,792 $(117)Cost of natural gas1,319 (220)Cost of other sales— (12)Other operations and maintenance888 (93)Depreciation and amortization487 (13)Taxes other than income taxes213 2Impairment charges115 73(Gain) loss on dispositions, net— 291Total operating expenses3,022 28Operating income770 (145)Earnings from equity method investments157 9Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized232 4Other income (expense), net20 19Income taxes130 (334)Net income$585 $213The Southern Company Gas Dispositions were completed by July 29, 2018 and represent the primary variance driver for 2019 compared to 2018. Detailed variance explanations are provided herein. See Note 15 to the financial statements under ""Southern Company Gas"" for additional information on the Southern Company Gas Dispositions.Seasonality of ResultsDuring the period from November through March when natural gas usage and operating revenues are generally higher (Heating Season), more customers are connected to Southern Company Gas' distribution systems and natural gas usage is higher in periods of colder weather. Occasionally in the summer, operating revenues are impacted due to peak usage by power generators in response to summer energy demands. Southern Company Gas' base operating expenses, excluding cost of natural gas, bad debt expense, and certain incentive compensation costs, are incurred relatively equally over any given year. Thus, operating results can vary significantly from quarter to quarter as a result of seasonality. For 2019, the percentage of operating revenues and net income generated during the Heating Season (January through March and November through December) were 68.7% and 86.8%, respectively. For 2018, the percentage of operating revenues and net income generated during the Heating Season were 68.7% and 96.0%, respectively.II-26 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2019 Annual ReportOperating RevenuesOperating revenues in 2019 were $3.8 billion, a $117 million decrease compared to 2018. Details of operating revenues were as follows: 2019 (in millions)Operating revenues – prior year$3,909Estimated change resulting from –Infrastructure replacement programs and base rate changes96Gas costs and other cost recovery(89)Wholesale gas services150Southern Company Gas Dispositions(*)(300)Other26Operating revenues – current year$3,792Percent change(3.0)%(*)Includes a $245 million decrease related to natural gas revenues, including alternative revenue programs, and a $55 million decrease related to other revenues. See Note 15 to the financial statements under ""Southern Company Gas"" for additional information.Revenues from infrastructure replacement programs and base rate changes increased in 2019 compared to the prior year primarily due to increases of $74 million at Nicor Gas and $16 million at Atlanta Gas Light. These amounts include the natural gas distribution utilities' continued investments recovered through infrastructure replacement programs and base rate increases as well as customer refunds in 2018 as a result of the Tax Reform Legislation. See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Southern Company Gas"" for additional information.Revenues attributable to gas costs and other cost recovery decreased in 2019 compared to the prior year primarily due to lower natural gas prices and decreased volumes of natural gas sold. Natural gas distribution rates include provisions to adjust billings for fluctuations in natural gas costs. Therefore, gas costs recovered through natural gas revenues generally equal the amount expensed in cost of natural gas and do not affect net income from the natural gas distribution utilities.Revenues from wholesale gas services increased in 2019 primarily due to derivative gains, partially offset by decreased commercial activity.Other natural gas revenues increased in 2019 primarily due to increases in customers at the natural gas distribution utilities and recovery of prior period hedge losses at gas marketing services.Cost of Natural Gas Excluding Atlanta Gas Light, which does not sell natural gas to end-use customers, the natural gas distribution utilities charge their utility customers for natural gas consumed using natural gas cost recovery mechanisms set by the applicable state regulatory agencies. Under these mechanisms, all prudently-incurred natural gas costs are passed through to customers without markup, subject to regulatory review. The natural gas distribution utilities defer or accrue the difference between the actual cost of natural gas and the amount of commodity revenue earned in a given period. The deferred or accrued amount is either billed or refunded to customers prospectively through adjustments to the commodity rate. Deferred natural gas costs are reflected as regulatory assets and accrued natural gas costs are reflected as regulatory liabilities. Therefore, gas costs recovered through natural gas revenues generally equal the amount expensed in cost of natural gas and do not affect net income from the natural gas distribution utilities. Cost of natural gas at the natural gas distribution utilities represented 84.5% of the total cost of natural gas for 2019.Gas marketing services customers are charged for actual and estimated natural gas consumed. Cost of natural gas includes the cost of fuel and associated transportation costs, lost and unaccounted for gas, adjustments to reduce the value of inventories to market value, if applicable, and gains and losses associated with certain derivatives.In 2019, cost of natural gas was $1.3 billion, a decrease of $220 million, or 14.3%, compared to the prior year. Excluding a $106 million decrease related to the Southern Company Gas Dispositions, cost of natural gas decreased by $114 million, which reflects a 14.8% decrease in natural gas prices compared to 2018.II-27 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2019 Annual ReportCost of Other SalesCost of other sales related to Pivotal Home Solutions, which was sold on June 4, 2018. See Note 15 to the financial statements under ""Southern Company Gas – Sale of Pivotal Home Solutions"" for additional information.Other Operations and Maintenance ExpensesOther operations and maintenance expenses decreased $93 million, or 9.5%, in 2019 compared to the prior year. Excluding a $65 million decrease related to the Southern Company Gas Dispositions, other operations and maintenance expenses decreased $28 million. This decrease was primarily due to $28 million of disposition-related costs incurred during 2018, a $12 million adjustment in 2018 for the adoption of a new paid time off policy, an $11 million expense for a litigation settlement to facilitate the sale of Pivotal Home Solutions in 2018, and a $7 million decrease in compensation and benefits costs, partially offset by a $22 million increase in rider expenses, primarily at Nicor Gas, passed through directly to customers. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – ""Southern Company Gas – Utility Regulation and Rate Design"" herein for additional information.Depreciation and AmortizationDepreciation and amortization decreased $13 million, or 2.6%, in 2019 compared to the prior year. Excluding a $27 million decrease related to the Southern Company Gas Dispositions, depreciation and amortization increased $14 million. This increase was primarily due to continued infrastructure investments at the natural gas distribution utilities, partially offset by accelerated depreciation related to assets retired in 2018. See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Southern Company Gas – Infrastructure Replacement Programs and Capital Projects"" for additional information.Impairment ChargesIn 2019, Southern Company Gas recorded impairment charges of $91 million related to a natural gas storage facility in Louisiana and $24 million in contemplation of the sale of its interests in Pivotal LNG and Atlantic Coast Pipeline. In 2018, a goodwill impairment charge of $42 million was recorded in contemplation of the sale of Pivotal Home Solutions.

These revenues increased $134 million, or 2.5%, in 2019 as compared to the prior year. The increase in 2019 was primarily due to increases in rates and pricing associated with the impact of customer bill credits issued in 2018 related to the Tax Reform Legislation and additional capital investments recovered through Rate CNP Compliance, as well as a lower Rate RSE customer refund in 2019 as compared to the prior year, partially offset by decreases in fuel revenues and customer usage, as well as milder weather in 2019 as compared to 2018. See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Alabama Power – Rate RSE"" and "" – Rate CNP Compliance"" for additional information. See ""Energy Sales"" herein for a discussion of changes in the volume of energy sold, including changes related to sales decline and weather. Electric rates include provisions to recognize the recovery of fuel costs, purchased power costs, PPAs certificated by the Alabama PSC, and costs associated with the natural disaster reserve. Under these provisions, fuel and other cost recovery revenues generally equal fuel and other cost recovery expenses and do not affect net income. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – ""Regulatory Matters – Alabama Power – Rate ECR"" herein for additional information.Wholesale revenues from power sales to non-affiliated utilities were as follows: 2019 2018 (in millions)Capacity and other$102 $101Energy156 178Total non-affiliated$258 $279Wholesale revenues from sales to non-affiliates will vary depending on fuel prices, the market prices of wholesale energy compared to the cost of Alabama Power's and the Southern Company system's generation, demand for energy within the Southern Company system's electric service territory, and availability of the Southern Company system's generation. Increases and decreases in energy revenues that are driven by fuel prices are accompanied by an increase or decrease in fuel costs and do not affect net income. Short-term opportunity energy sales are also included in wholesale energy sales to non-affiliates. These opportunity sales are made at market-based rates that generally provide a margin above Alabama Power's variable cost to produce the energy.II-31 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2019 Annual ReportIn 2019, wholesale revenues from sales to non-affiliates decreased $21 million, or 7.5%, as compared to the prior year primarily as a result of an 8.2% decrease in energy prices due to lower natural gas prices, partially offset by a 1% increase in the amount of KWHs sold.Wholesale revenues from sales to affiliated companies will vary depending on demand and the availability and cost of generating resources at each company. These affiliate sales and purchases are made in accordance with the IIC, as approved by the FERC. These transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings since this energy is generally sold at marginal cost and energy purchases are generally offset by energy revenues through Alabama Power's energy cost recovery clause.In 2019, wholesale revenues from sales to affiliates decreased $38 million, or 31.9%, as compared to the prior year. In 2019, KWH sales decreased 22.7% due to the decreased availability of coal generation associated with the retirement of Plant Gorgas Units 8, 9, and 10, and the price of energy decreased 11.8% as a result of lower natural gas prices.In 2019, other operating revenues increased $18 million, or 6.7%, as compared to the prior year primarily due to an increase in unregulated sales of products and services and pole attachment agreements. Energy SalesChanges in revenues are influenced heavily by the change in the volume of energy sold from year to year. KWH sales for 2019 and the percent change from the prior year were as follows: 2019 TotalKWHs Total KWHPercent Change Weather-AdjustedPercent Change (in billions) Residential18.3 (1.9)% (1.5)%Commercial13.6 (2.2) (2.2)Industrial22.1 (3.7) (3.7)Other0.2 (7.3) (7.3)Total retail54.2 (2.8) (2.6)%Wholesale Non-affiliates5.1 1.2 Affiliates3.5 (22.7) Total wholesale8.6 (10.1) Total energy sales62.8 (3.8)% Changes in retail energy sales are generally the result of changes in electricity usage by customers, changes in weather, and changes in the number of customers. Retail energy sales in 2019 decreased 2.8% primarily due to lower customer usage and milder weather in 2019 compared to 2018. Weather-adjusted residential sales were 1.5% lower in 2019 primarily due to lower customer usage resulting from an increase in penetration of energy-efficient residential appliances, partially offset by customer growth. Weather-adjusted commercial sales were 2.2% lower in 2019 primarily due to lower customer usage resulting from customer initiatives in energy savings and an ongoing migration to the electronic commerce business model, partially offset by customer growth. Industrial sales decreased 3.7% in 2019 as compared to 2018 primarily as a result of changes in production levels in the primary metals and chemicals sectors.See ""Operating Revenues"" above for a discussion of significant changes in wholesale revenues from sales to non-affiliates and wholesale revenues from sales to affiliated companies related to changes in price and KWH sales.Fuel and Purchased Power ExpensesThe mix of fuel sources for generation of electricity is determined primarily by the unit cost of fuel consumed, demand, and the availability of generating units. Additionally, Alabama Power purchases a portion of its electricity needs from the wholesale market.II-32 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2019 Annual ReportDetails of Alabama Power's generation and purchased power were as follows: 2019 2018Total generation (in billions of KWHs)56.9 60.5Total purchased power (in billions of KWHs)9.4 8.1Sources of generation (percent) — Coal45 50Nuclear25 23Gas21 19Hydro9 8Cost of fuel, generated (in cents per net KWH) — Coal2.69 2.73Nuclear0.77 0.77Gas2.47 2.84Average cost of fuel, generated (in cents per net KWH)(a)(b)2.11 2.26Average cost of purchased power (in cents per net KWH)(c)4.39 5.47(a)For 2018, cost of fuel, generated and average cost of fuel, generated excludes a $30 million adjustment associated with a May 2018 Alabama PSC accounting order related to excess deferred income taxes.

The decrease was primarily due to a $102 million decrease in the average cost of purchased power, a $56 million decrease in the average cost of fuel, a $30 million net decrease related to the volume of KWHs purchased and generated, and a $30 million decrease in fuel expense associated with the May 2018 Alabama PSC accounting order.Fuel and purchased power energy transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings, since energy expenses are generally offset by energy revenues through Alabama Power's energy cost recovery clause. Alabama Power, along with the Alabama PSC, continuously monitors the under/over recovered balance to determine whether adjustments to billing rates are required. See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Alabama Power – Rate ECR"" for additional information.FuelFuel expenses were $1.1 billion in 2019, a decrease of $189 million, or 14.5%, compared to 2018. The decrease was primarily due to a 13% decrease in the average cost of KWHs generated by natural gas, which excludes tolling agreements, a 14.4% decrease in the volume of KWHs generated by coal, and a 5.2% increase in the volume of KWHs generated by hydro, as well as a $30 million decrease in fuel expense associated with the May 2018 Alabama PSC accounting order.Purchased Power – Non-AffiliatesPurchased power expense from non-affiliates was $203 million in 2019, a decrease of $13 million, or 6.0%, compared to 2018. This decrease was primarily due to a 12.6% decrease in the average cost per KWH purchased due to lower natural gas prices. The decrease was partially offset by a 9.1% increase in the amount of energy purchased as a result of decreased coal generation due to the retirement of Plant Gorgas Units 8, 9, and 10. Energy purchases from non-affiliates will vary depending on the market prices of wholesale energy as compared to the cost of the Southern Company system's generation, demand for energy within the Southern Company system's service territory, and the availability of the Southern Company system's generation.Purchased Power – AffiliatesPurchased power expense from affiliates was $200 million in 2019, a decrease of $16 million, or 7.4%, compared to 2018. This decrease was primarily due to a 25.2% decrease in the average cost per KWH purchased due to lower natural gas prices. The decrease was partially offset by a 24.1% increase in the amount of energy purchased primarily due to the availability of lower-cost II-33 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2019 Annual Reportgeneration compared to Alabama Power's owned generation and a decrease in coal generation due to the retirement of Plant Gorgas Units 8, 9, and 10. Energy purchases from affiliates will vary depending on demand for energy and the availability and cost of generating resources at each company within the Southern Company system. These purchases are made in accordance with the IIC or other contractual agreements, as approved by the FERC.Other Operations and Maintenance ExpensesIn 2019, other operations and maintenance expenses increased $152 million, or 9.1%, as compared to the prior year primarily due to additional accruals of $123 million to the NDR as well as $11 million in Rate CNP Compliance-related expenses. See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Alabama Power – Rate NDR"" and "" – Rate CNP Compliance"" for additional information.Depreciation and AmortizationDepreciation and amortization increased $29 million, or 3.8%, in 2019 as compared to the prior year primarily due to additional plant in service. See Note 5 to the financial statements under ""Depreciation and Amortization"" for additional information.Other Income (Expense), NetOther income (expense), net increased $26 million, or 130.0%, in 2019 as compared to the prior year primarily due to a decrease of $17 million in charitable donations and an increase of $9 million in interest income from temporary cash investments. Income Taxes Income taxes decreased $21 million, or 7.2%, in 2019 as compared to the prior year primarily due to additional benefits from the flowback of excess deferred income taxes in accordance with an Alabama PSC accounting order, partially offset by an increase in pre-tax net income. See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Alabama Power – Tax Reform Accounting Order"" for additional information.Georgia PowerGeorgia Power's 2019 net income was $1.7 billion, representing a $927 million, or 116.9%, increase from the previous year. The increase was primarily due to a $1.1 billion ($0.8 billion after tax) charge in the second quarter 2018 for an estimated probable loss related to Georgia Power's construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, an increase in retail base revenues associated with higher contributions from commercial and industrial customers with variable demand-driven pricing, and an increase in other revenues primarily related to unregulated sales. Partially offsetting the increase were higher non-fuel operations and maintenance expenses and depreciation and amortization.A condensed income statement for Georgia Power follows: 2019 Increase(Decrease)from 2018 (in millions)Operating revenues$8,408 $(12)Fuel1,444 (254)Purchased power1,096 (57)Other operations and maintenance1,972 112Depreciation and amortization981 58Taxes other than income taxes454 17Estimated loss on Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4— (1,060)Total operating expenses5,947 (1,184)Operating income2,461 1,172Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized409 12Other income (expense), net140 25Income taxes472 258Net income$1,720 $927II-34 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2019 Annual ReportOperating RevenuesOperating revenues for 2019 were $8.4 billion, a $12 million decrease from 2018.

The significant factors driving this change are shown in the preceding table. The increase in rates and pricing was primarily due to higher contributions from commercial and industrial customers with variable demand-driven pricing, an increase in the NCCR tariff effective January 1, 2019, and pricing effects associated with a milder winter in 2019 compared to 2018. See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Georgia Power – Nuclear Construction"" for additional information related to the NCCR tariff.See ""Energy Sales"" below for a discussion of changes in the volume of energy sold, including changes related to the sales decline in 2019.Electric rates include provisions to adjust billings for fluctuations in fuel costs, including the energy component of purchased power costs. Under these fuel cost recovery provisions, fuel revenues generally equal fuel expenses and do not affect net income. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – ""Regulatory Matters – Georgia Power – Fuel Cost Recovery"" herein for additional information.Wholesale revenues from power sales to non-affiliated utilities were as follows: 2019 2018 (in millions)Capacity and other$55 $54Energy74 109Total non-affiliated$129 $163Wholesale capacity revenues from PPAs are recognized either on a levelized basis over the appropriate contract period or the amounts billable under the contract terms and provide for recovery of fixed costs and a return on investment. Wholesale revenues from sales to non-affiliates will vary depending on fuel prices, the market prices of wholesale energy compared to the cost of Georgia Power's and the Southern Company system's generation, demand for energy within the Southern Company system's electric service territory, and the availability of the Southern Company system's generation. Increases and decreases in energy revenues that are driven by fuel prices are accompanied by an increase or decrease in fuel costs and do not have a significant impact on net income. Short-term opportunity sales are made at market-based rates that generally provide a margin above Georgia Power's variable cost of energy.Wholesale revenues from non-affiliated sales decreased $34 million, or 20.9%, in 2019 as compared to 2018 primarily due to lower energy prices and lower demand.II-35 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2019 Annual ReportWholesale revenues from sales to affiliated companies will vary depending on demand and the availability and cost of generating resources at each company. These affiliate sales are made in accordance with the IIC, as approved by the FERC. These transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings since this energy is generally sold at marginal cost. In 2019, wholesale revenues from sales to affiliates decreased $13 million, or 54.2%, as compared to 2018 primarily due to a 36.3% decrease in KWH sales as a result of the lower market cost of available energy compared to the cost of Georgia Power-owned generation.Other operating revenues increased $80 million, or 16.6%, in 2019 from the prior year primarily due to revenue increases of $27 million from power delivery construction and maintenance contracts, $20 million from unregulated sales associated with new energy conservation projects, $11 million from outdoor lighting LED conversions and sales, $7 million from OATT sales, and $6 million in wholesale operating fees associated with contractual targets.Energy SalesChanges in revenues are influenced heavily by the change in the volume of energy sold from year to year.

The decrease was primarily due to a $289 million decrease related to the average cost of fuel and purchased power.Fuel and purchased power energy transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings since these fuel expenses are generally offset by fuel revenues through Georgia Power's fuel cost recovery mechanism. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – ""Regulatory Matters – Georgia Power – Fuel Cost Recovery"" herein for additional information.FuelFuel expense was $1.4 billion in 2019, a decrease of $254 million, or 15.0%, compared to 2018. The decrease was primarily due to a 10% decrease in the average cost of fuel, primarily related to lower natural gas prices, and a 3.9% decrease in the volume of KWHs generated, primarily due to the lower market cost of energy compared to available Georgia Power resources.Purchased Power - Non-AffiliatesPurchased power expense from non-affiliates was $521 million in 2019, an increase of $91 million, or 21.2%, compared to 2018. The increase was primarily due to a 53.1% increase in the volume of KWHs purchased primarily due to the lower market cost of energy compared to available Southern Company system resources and warmer weather in the third quarter 2019 resulting in higher customer demand, partially offset by a 22.1% decrease in the average cost per KWH purchased primarily due to lower energy prices.The volume increase also reflects purchases from Gulf Power which were classified as affiliate prior to January 1, 2019. See Note 15 to the financial statements for information regarding the sale of Gulf Power.Energy purchases from non-affiliates will vary depending on the market prices of wholesale energy as compared to the cost of the Southern Company system's generation, demand for energy within the Southern Company system's electric service territory, and the availability of the Southern Company system's generation.Purchased Power - AffiliatesPurchased power expense from affiliates was $575 million in 2019, a decrease of $148 million, or 20.5%, compared to 2018. The decrease was primarily due to an 11.1% decrease in the volume of KWHs purchased as Georgia Power units generally dispatched at a lower cost than other Southern Company system resources and a 13.0% decrease in the average cost per KWH purchased resulting from lower energy prices.The decrease in purchased power expense from affiliates also reflects a change in the classification of capacity expenses of $24 million related to PPAs with Southern Power accounted for as finance leases following the adoption of FASB ASC Topic 842, Leases (ASC 842). In 2019, these expenses are included in depreciation and amortization and interest expense, net of amounts capitalized. The decrease in the volume of KWHs purchased also includes the effect of classifying purchases from Gulf Power as II-37 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2019 Annual Reportnon-affiliate beginning January 1, 2019. See Notes 9 and 15 to the financial statements for additional information regarding ASC 842 and the sale of Gulf Power, respectively.Energy purchases from affiliates will vary depending on the demand and the availability and cost of generating resources at each company within the Southern Company system. These purchases are made in accordance with the IIC or other contractual agreements, all as approved by the FERC.Other Operations and Maintenance ExpensesIn 2019, other operations and maintenance expenses increased $112 million, or 6.0%, compared to 2018. The increase reflects increases in expenses of $30 million from unregulated sales primarily associated with new energy conservation projects and power delivery construction and maintenance contracts, $26 million related to scheduled generation outages, $16 million related to an adjustment for FERC fees following the conclusion of a multi-year audit of headwater benefits associated with hydro facilities, $12 million primarily due to the timing of vegetation management and other transmission-related expenses, and $10 million associated with generation maintenance.Depreciation and AmortizationDepreciation and amortization increased $58 million, or 6.3%, in 2019 compared to 2018. The increase was primarily due to a $31 million increase in depreciation associated with additional plant in service and a $19 million increase in the amortization of regulatory assets related to the retirement of certain generating units. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – ""Regulatory Matters – Georgia Power – Integrated Resource Plan"" herein for additional information on unit retirements.The increase also reflects the classification of approximately $9 million related to PPAs with Southern Power accounted for as finance leases following the adoption of ASC 842. In prior periods, the expenses related to these PPAs were included in purchased power, affiliates. See Note 9 to the financial statements for additional information regarding ASC 842.See Note 5 to the financial statements under ""Depreciation and Amortization"" for additional information.Taxes Other Than Income TaxesIn 2019, taxes other than income taxes increased $17 million, or 3.9%, compared to 2018 primarily due to higher property taxes of $25 million as a result of increases in the assessed value of property, partially offset by a decrease of $11 million in municipal franchise fees, largely due to adjustments associated with the Georgia Power Tax Reform Settlement Agreement. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – ""Regulatory Matters – Georgia Power – Rate Plans – Tax Reform Settlement Agreement"" herein for additional information.Estimated Loss on Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4In the second quarter 2018, an estimated probable loss of $1.1 billion was recorded to reflect Georgia Power's revised estimate to complete construction and start-up of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. See ACCOUNTING POLICIES – ""Estimated Cost, Schedule, and Rate Recovery for the Construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4"" herein and Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Georgia Power – Nuclear Construction"" for additional information.Interest Expense, Net of Amounts CapitalizedIn 2019, interest expense, net of amounts capitalized increased $12 million, or 3.0%, compared to 2018. The increase was primarily due to the reclassification of $15 million related to PPAs with Southern Power accounted for as finance leases following the adoption of ASC 842 and a $6 million increase in interest expense associated with an increase in outstanding short-term borrowings, partially offset by a $9 million increase in amounts capitalized largely associated with Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4.In prior periods, the expenses related to the PPAs with Southern Power were included in purchased power, affiliates. See FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY – ""Sources of Capital"" and ""Financing Activities"" herein for additional information on borrowings, Note 9 to the financial statements for additional information regarding ASC 842, and Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Georgia Power – Nuclear Construction"" for additional information regarding Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4.Other Income (Expense), NetIn 2019, other income (expense), net increased $25 million compared to the prior year primarily due to a $16 million increase in non-service cost-related retirement benefits income and a $13 million decrease in charitable donations, partially offset by a $4 million decrease in interest income from temporary cash investments. See Note 11 to the financial statements for additional information on Georgia Power's net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit costs.II-38 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2019 Annual ReportIncome TaxesIncome taxes increased $258 million, or 120.6%, in 2019 compared to the prior year primarily as a result of higher pre-tax earnings largely due to the 2018 charge associated with Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 construction. This increase was partially offset by additional state ITCs recognized in 2019 and the recognition of a valuation allowance in 2018. See Note 10 to the financial statements for additional information.Mississippi PowerMississippi Power's net income after dividends on preferred stock was $139 million in 2019 compared to $235 million in 2018.

This decrease was largely offset by an increase in rates and pricing, primarily related to PEP and ECO Plan rate changes that became effective for the first billing cycle of September 2018, net of a new tolling arrangement accounted for as a sales-type lease effective January 2019. See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Mississippi Power – Environmental Compliance Overview Plan"" and "" – Performance Evaluation Plan"" and Note 9 to the financial statements under ""Lessor"" for additional information. See ""Energy Sales"" below for a discussion of changes in the volume of energy sold, including changes related to sales and weather.Electric rates for Mississippi Power include provisions to adjust billings for fluctuations in fuel costs, including the energy component of purchased power costs. Under these provisions, fuel revenues generally equal fuel expenses, including the energy component of purchased power costs, and do not affect net income. Recoverable fuel costs include fuel and purchased power expenses reduced by the fuel and emissions portion of wholesale revenues from energy sold to customers outside Mississippi Power's service territory. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – ""Regulatory Matters – Mississippi Power – Fuel Cost Recovery"" herein for additional information.Wholesale revenues from power sales to non-affiliated utilities, including FERC-regulated MRA sales as well as market-based sales, were as follows: 2019 2018 (in millions)Capacity and other$3 $6Energy234 257Total non-affiliated$237 $263Wholesale revenues from sales to non-affiliates will vary depending on fuel prices, the market prices of wholesale energy compared to the cost of Mississippi Power's and the Southern Company system's generation, demand for energy within the Southern Company system's electric service territory, and the availability of the Southern Company system's generation. Increases and decreases in energy revenues that are driven by fuel prices are accompanied by an increase or decrease in fuel costs and do not have a significant impact on net income. In addition, Mississippi Power provides service under long-term contracts with rural electric cooperative associations and municipalities located in southeastern Mississippi under cost-based electric tariffs which are subject to regulation by the FERC. The contracts with these wholesale customers represented 15.7% of Mississippi Power's total II-40 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2019 Annual Reportoperating revenues in 2019 and are generally subject to 10-year rolling cancellation notices. Historically, these wholesale customers have acted as a group and any changes in contractual relationships for one customer are likely to be followed by the other wholesale customers. Short-term opportunity energy sales are also included in sales for resale to non-affiliates. These opportunity sales are made at market-based rates that generally provide a margin above Mississippi Power's variable cost to produce the energy.Wholesale revenues from sales to non-affiliates decreased $26 million, or 9.9%, compared to 2018. This decrease primarily reflects decreases of $14 million from lower fuel prices, $6 million from decreased customer usage, and $8 million from lower PPA capacity and energy sales.Wholesale revenues from sales to affiliates will vary depending on demand and the availability and cost of generating resources at each company. These affiliate sales are made in accordance with the IIC, as approved by the FERC. These transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings since this energy is generally sold at marginal cost.Wholesale revenues from sales to affiliates increased $41 million, or 45.1%, in 2019 compared to 2018. This increase was primarily due to a $76 million increase associated with higher KWH sales due to the dispatch of Mississippi Power's lower cost generation resources to serve the Southern Company system's territorial load, partially offset by a $35 million decrease associated with lower natural gas prices.Energy SalesChanges in revenues are influenced heavily by the change in the volume of energy sold from year to year. KWH sales for 2019 and the percent change from the prior year were as follows: 2019 TotalKWHs Total KWHPercent Change Weather-Adjusted Percent Change (in millions) Residential2,062 (2.4)% (0.8)%Commercial2,715 (2.9) (2.7)Industrial4,795 (2.6) (2.6)Other36 (1.9) (1.9)Total retail9,608 (2.7) (2.2)%Wholesale Non-affiliated3,966 (0.3) Affiliated4,758 84.1 Total wholesale8,724 32.9 Total energy sales18,332 11.5 % Changes in retail energy sales are generally the result of changes in electricity usage by customers, changes in weather, and changes in the number of customers. Retail energy sales decreased 2.7% in 2019 as compared to the prior year, primarily due to decreased demand by several large industrial customers. Weather-adjusted residential and commercial KWH sales decreased 0.8% and 2.7%, respectively, in 2019 primarily due to decreased customer usage as a result of an increase in energy saving initiatives, slightly offset by customer growth. See ""Operating Revenues"" above for a discussion of significant changes in wholesale revenues to affiliated companies.Fuel and Purchased Power ExpensesThe mix of fuel sources for generation of electricity is determined primarily by demand, the unit cost of fuel consumed, and the availability of generating units. Additionally, Mississippi Power purchases a portion of its electricity needs from the wholesale market.II-41 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2019 Annual ReportDetails of Mississippi Power's generation and purchased power were as follows: 2019 2018Total generation (in millions of KWHs)18,269 15,966Total purchased power (in millions of KWHs)529 960Sources of generation (percent) – Gas94 93Coal6 7Cost of fuel, generated (in cents per net KWH) – Gas2.26 2.65Coal4.05 3.50Average cost of fuel, generated (in cents per net KWH)2.37 2.72Average cost of purchased power (in cents per net KWH)3.71 4.27Fuel and purchased power expenses were $427 million in 2019, a decrease of $19 million, or 4.3%, as compared to the prior year. The decrease was primarily due to a $60 million decrease related to the average cost of fuel and purchased power primarily due to the lower average cost of natural gas, partially offset by a $41 million net increase associated with the volume of KWHs generated and purchased primarily due to the availability of Mississippi Power's lower-cost generation resources.Fuel and purchased power energy transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings, since energy expenses are generally offset by energy revenues through Mississippi Power's fuel cost recovery clauses. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – ""Regulatory Matters – Mississippi Power – Fuel Cost Recovery"" herein and Note 1 to the financial statements under ""Fuel Costs"" for additional information.FuelFuel expense increased $2 million, or 0.5%, in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to a 15% increase in the volume of KWHs generated, partially offset by a 13% net decrease in the average cost of fuel per KWH generated.Purchased Power Purchased power expense decreased $21 million, or 51.2%, in 2019 compared to 2018. The decrease was primarily the result of a 45% decrease in the volume of KWHs purchased due to the availability of Mississippi Power's lower-cost generation resources and a 13% decrease in the average cost per KWH purchased.Energy purchases will vary depending on the market prices of wholesale energy as compared to the cost of the Southern Company system's generation, demand for energy within the Southern Company system's service territory, and the availability of the Southern Company system's generation. These purchases are made in accordance with the IIC or other contractual agreements, as approved by the FERC.Other Operations and Maintenance ExpensesOther operations and maintenance expenses decreased $30 million, or 9.6%, in 2019 compared to the prior year. The decrease was primarily due to decreases of $21 million in compensation and benefit expenses primarily due to an employee attrition plan implemented in the third quarter 2018, $5 million in amortization of previously deferred Plant Ratcliffe expenses as a result of a settlement agreement reached with wholesale customers (MRA Settlement Agreement), $5 million in planned generation outage costs, and $4 million in Plant Ratcliffe waste water treatment expenses. These decreases were partially offset by a $9 million increase in overhead line maintenance and vegetation management expenses. See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Mississippi Power – Municipal and Rural Associations Tariff"" for additional information.Depreciation and AmortizationDepreciation and amortization increased $23 million, or 13.6%, in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily related to increases in amortization associated with ECO Plan regulatory assets. See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Mississippi Power – Environmental Compliance Overview Plan"" for additional information.II-42 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2019 Annual ReportTaxes Other Than Income TaxesTaxes other than income taxes increased $6 million, or 5.6%, in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to increases of $4 million in ad valorem taxes and $2 million in franchise taxes.Estimated Loss on Kemper IGCCIn 2019 and 2018, charges of $24 million and $37 million, respectively, were recorded associated with the abandonment and closure activities and period costs, net of sales proceeds for the mine and gasifier-related assets. The 2019 charge primarily related to the expected close out of a DOE contract related to the Kemper County energy facility. See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Kemper County Energy Facility"" for additional information.Interest Expense, Net of Amounts CapitalizedInterest expense, net of amounts capitalized decreased $7 million, or 9.2%, in 2019 compared to 2018, primarily as the result of a decrease in outstanding long-term borrowings. See Note 8 to the financial statements for additional information.Other Income (Expense), NetOther income (expense), net decreased $5 million in 2019 compared to 2018. The decrease was primarily due to the $24 million settlement of Mississippi Power's Deepwater Horizon claim in 2018, partially offset by a $9 million increase in interest income associated with a new tolling arrangement accounted for as a sales-type lease and a $7 million decrease in charitable donations. See Notes 3 and 9 to the financial statements under ""Other Matters – Mississippi Power"" and ""Lessor,"" respectively, for additional information.Income Taxes (Benefit)Income tax expense increased $132 million, or 129.4%, in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to a $92 million increase related to the 2018 reduction of a valuation allowance for a state income tax net operating loss (NOL) carryforward, a $42 million increase associated with the revaluation of deferred tax assets related to the Kemper IGCC recorded in 2018 in accordance with the Tax Reform Legislation, and a $9 million increase due to higher pre-tax earnings in 2019. These increases were partially offset by $15 million associated with the flowback of excess deferred income taxes resulting from the MRA Settlement Agreement and a new tolling arrangement accounted for as a sales-type lease. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – ""Income Tax Matters"" herein and Note 10 to the financial statements for additional information.Southern PowerNet income attributable to Southern Power for 2019 was $339 million, a $152 million increase from 2018, primarily due to net impacts totaling approximately $141 million from the dispositions of the Florida Plants in 2018 and Plant Nacogdoches in the second quarter 2019, which include an asset impairment charge in 2018, a gain on sale in 2019 (including the recognition of deferred ITCs), and a decrease in operations and maintenance expense, partially offset by PPA capacity revenue decreases in 2019. The increase in net income also reflects $79 million in tax expense recognized in 2018 related to the Tax Reform Legislation, a $27 million wind turbine equipment impairment charge in 2018, and net gains in 2019 of $25 million from the Roserock solar facility litigation settlement and sales of wind equipment. These increases were partially offset by $65 million in state income tax benefits recorded in 2018 arising from the reorganization of Southern Power's legal entities and reductions in net income of approximately $60 million related to the SP Wind tax equity partnership entered into in 2018.See Note 15 to the financial statements under ""Southern Power – Sales of Natural Gas and Biomass Plants"" and "" – Development Projects"" for additional information on the Florida Plants and Plant Nacogdoches dispositions and sales of wind turbine equipment.

To the extent Southern Power has capacity not contracted under a PPA, it may sell power into an accessible wholesale market, or, to the extent those generation assets are part of the FERC-approved IIC, it may sell power into the Southern Company power pool.Natural Gas and Biomass Capacity and Energy RevenueCapacity revenues generally represent the greatest contribution to operating income and are designed to provide recovery of fixed costs plus a return on investment.Energy is generally sold at variable cost or is indexed to published natural gas indices. Energy revenues will vary depending on the energy demand of Southern Power's customers and their generation capacity, as well as the market prices of wholesale energy compared to the cost of Southern Power's energy. Energy revenues also include fees for support services, fuel storage, and unit start charges. Increases and decreases in energy revenues under PPAs that are driven by fuel or purchased power prices are accompanied by an increase or decrease in fuel and purchased power costs and do not have a significant impact on net income.Solar and Wind Energy RevenueSouthern Power's energy sales from solar and wind generating facilities are predominantly through long-term PPAs that do not have capacity revenue. Customers either purchase the energy output of a dedicated renewable facility through an energy charge or pay a fixed price related to the energy generated from the respective facility and sold to the grid. As a result, Southern Power's ability to recover fixed and variable operations and maintenance expenses is dependent upon the level of energy generated from these facilities, which can be impacted by weather conditions, equipment performance, transmission constraints, and other factors. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – ""Southern Power's Power Sales Agreements"" herein for additional information regarding Southern Power's PPAs.II-44 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2019 Annual ReportOperating Revenues DetailsDetails of Southern Power's operating revenues were as follows: 2019 2018 (in millions)PPA capacity revenues $482 $580PPA energy revenues 1,081 1,140Total PPA revenues1,563 1,720Non-PPA revenues 363 472Other revenues12 13Total operating revenues$1,938 $2,205Operating revenues for 2019 were $1.9 billion, a $267 million, or 12%, decrease from 2018. The decrease in operating revenues was primarily due to the following:•PPA capacity revenues decreased $98 million, or 17%, primarily due to the sales of the Florida Plants in December 2018 and Plant Nacogdoches in June 2019. In addition, the change reflects a reduction of $34 million from the expiration of an affiliate natural gas PPA, offset by a $36 million increase in new PPA capacity revenues from existing natural gas facilities, of which $13 million related to the expansion unit at Plant Mankato.•PPA energy revenues decreased $59 million, or 5%, primarily due to a $67 million decrease in sales from natural gas facilities primarily driven by a $103 million decrease in the average cost of fuel and purchased power, partially offset by a $36 million increase in the volume of KWHs sold due to increased customer load.•Non-PPA revenues decreased $109 million, or 23%, primarily due to a $72 million decrease in the volume of KWHs sold through short-term sales and a $37 million decrease in the market price of energy.Fuel and Purchased Power ExpensesDetails of Southern Power's generation and purchased power were as follows: TotalKWHsTotal KWH % ChangeTotalKWHs 2019 2018 (in billions of KWHs)Generation47 46Purchased power3 4Total generation and purchased power50—%50Total generation and purchased power, excluding solar, wind, and tolling agreements29—%29Southern Power's PPAs for natural gas generation generally provide that the purchasers are responsible for either procuring the fuel (tolling agreements) or reimbursing Southern Power for substantially all of the cost of fuel relating to the energy delivered under such PPAs. Consequently, changes in such fuel costs are generally accompanied by a corresponding change in related fuel revenues and do not have a significant impact on net income. Southern Power is responsible for the cost of fuel for generating units that are not covered under PPAs. Power from these generating units is sold into the wholesale market or into the Southern Company power pool for capacity owned directly by Southern Power.Purchased power expenses will vary depending on demand, availability, and the cost of generating resources throughout the Southern Company system and other contract resources. Load requirements are submitted to the Southern Company power pool on an hourly basis and are fulfilled with the lowest cost alternative, whether that is generation owned by Southern Power, an affiliate company, or external parties. Such purchased power costs are generally recovered through PPA revenues.II-45 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2019 Annual ReportDetails of Southern Power's fuel and purchased power expenses were as follows: 2019 2018 (in millions)Fuel$577 $699Purchased power108 176Total fuel and purchased power expenses$685 $875In 2019, total fuel and purchased power expenses decreased $190 million, or 22%, compared to 2018. Fuel expense decreased $122 million, or 17%, due to a $137 million decrease in the average cost of fuel per KWH generated, partially offset by a $15 million increase associated with the volume of KWHs generated. Purchased power expense decreased $68 million, or 39%, due to a $37 million decrease associated with the average cost of purchased power and a $31 million decrease associated with the volume of KWHs purchased.Other Operations and Maintenance ExpensesIn 2019, other operations and maintenance expenses decreased $36 million, or 9%, compared to 2018. The decrease was due to gains totaling $17 million on the sale of wind turbine equipment, decreased expense of $17 million related to the dispositions of the Florida Plants and Plant Nacogdoches, and the recovery of $5 million in legal costs related to the Roserock solar facility litigation settlement in the first quarter 2019. See Note 15 to the financial statements under ""Southern Power – Development Projects"" and "" – Sales of Natural Gas and Biomass Plants"" for additional information on the sale of wind turbine equipment and the dispositions, respectively. Also see Note 3 to the financial statements under ""General Litigation Matters – Southern Power"" for additional information on the litigation settlement.Asset ImpairmentAsset impairment charges totaling $156 million were recorded in 2018, including $119 million related to the sale of the Florida Plants and $36 million related to wind turbine equipment held for development projects. Asset impairment charges in 2019 were immaterial. See Note 15 to the financial statements under ""Southern Power – Sales of Natural Gas and Biomass Plants"" and "" – Development Projects"" for additional information.Gain on Dispositions, Net The sale of Plant Nacogdoches in 2019 resulted in a $23 million gain. See Note 15 to the financial statements under ""Southern Power – Sales of Natural Gas and Biomass Plants"" for additional information.Interest Expense, Net of Amounts CapitalizedIn 2019, interest expense, net of amounts capitalized decreased $14 million, or 8%, compared to 2018, primarily due to a decrease in the amount of outstanding debt.Other Income (Expense), NetIn 2019, other income (expense), net increased $24 million, or 104%, compared to 2018 primarily due to a $36 million gain arising from the Roserock solar facility litigation settlement in 2019, partially offset by a $14 million gain from a joint-development wind project in 2018 attributable to Southern Power's partner in the project, which was offset by a $14 million loss within noncontrolling interests. See Note 3 to the financial statements under ""Southern Power"" for additional information regarding the litigation settlement.Income Taxes (Benefit)In 2019, income tax benefit was $56 million compared to $164 million for 2018, a decrease of $108 million, primarily attributable to reductions in tax benefits of $127 million from wind PTCs primarily following the 2018 sale of a noncontrolling tax equity interest in SP Wind and $65 million from changes in state apportionment rates following the 2018 reorganizations of certain legal entities, as well as a $64 million increase in income tax expense as a result of higher pre-tax earnings, partially offset by $79 million in tax expense recognized in 2018 related to the Tax Reform Legislation and a $75 million tax benefit resulting from the recognition of deferred ITCs remaining from the original construction recognized in connection with the sale of Plant Nacogdoches.II-46 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2019 Annual ReportSee FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – ""Income Tax Matters – Federal Tax Reform Legislation"" herein and Notes 1, 10, and 15 to the financial statements under ""Income Taxes,"" ""Effective Tax Rate,"" and ""Southern Power,"" respectively, for additional information.Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling InterestsIn 2019, net income attributable to noncontrolling interests decreased $69 million, or 117%, compared to 2018. The decrease was primarily due to $92 million of losses attributable to noncontrolling interests related to the tax equity partnerships entered into in 2018 and $14 million attributable to a joint-development wind project in 2018, partially offset by an allocation of approximately $29 million of income to the noncontrolling interest partner related to the Roserock solar facility litigation settlement. See Note 3 to the financial statements under ""General Litigation Matters – Southern Power"" and Note 7 to the financial statements under ""Southern Power"" for additional information regarding the litigation settlement and tax equity partnerships, respectively.Southern Company GasOperating MetricsSouthern Company Gas continues to focus on several operating metrics, including Heating Degree Days, customer count, and volumes of natural gas sold.Southern Company Gas measures weather and the effect on its business using Heating Degree Days. Generally, increased Heating Degree Days result in higher demand for natural gas on Southern Company Gas' distribution system. Southern Company Gas has various regulatory mechanisms, such as weather and revenue normalization and straight-fixed-variable rate design, which limit its exposure to weather changes within typical ranges in each of its utility's respective service territory, including Nicor Gas following the approval of a revenue decoupling mechanism for residential customers in its recent rate case. Southern Company Gas also utilizes weather hedges to limit the negative income impacts in the event of warmer-than-normal weather.The number of customers served by gas distribution operations and gas marketing services can be impacted by natural gas prices, economic conditions, and competition from alternative fuels. Gas distribution operations and gas marketing services' customers are primarily located in Georgia and Illinois.Southern Company Gas' natural gas volume metrics for gas distribution operations and gas marketing services illustrate the effects of weather and customer demand for natural gas. Wholesale gas services' physical sales volumes represent the daily average natural gas volumes sold to its customers.Seasonality of ResultsDuring the Heating Season, natural gas usage and operating revenues are generally higher as more customers are connected to the gas distribution systems and natural gas usage is higher in periods of colder weather. Occasionally in the summer, wholesale gas services' operating revenues are impacted due to peak usage by power generators in response to summer energy demands. Southern Company Gas' base operating expenses, excluding cost of natural gas, bad debt expense, and certain incentive compensation costs, are incurred relatively evenly throughout the year. Seasonality also affects the comparison of certain balance sheet items across quarters, including receivables, unbilled revenues, natural gas for sale, and notes payable. However, these items are comparable when reviewing Southern Company Gas' annual results. Thus, Southern Company Gas' operating results can vary significantly from quarter to quarter as a result of seasonality, which is illustrated in the table below.

Detailed variance explanations are provided herein. See Note 15 to the financial statements under ""Southern Company Gas"" for additional information on the Southern Company Gas Dispositions.II-48 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2019 Annual ReportOperating RevenuesOperating revenues in 2019 were $3.8 billion, a $117 million decrease, compared to 2018. Details of operating revenues were as follows: 2019 (in millions)Operating revenues – prior year$3,909Estimated change resulting from –Infrastructure replacement programs and base rate changes96Gas costs and other cost recovery(89)Wholesale gas services150Southern Company Gas Dispositions(*)(300)Other26Operating revenues – current year$3,792Percent change(3.0)%(*)Includes a $245 million decrease related to natural gas revenues, including alternative revenue programs, and a $55 million decrease related to other revenues. See Note 15 to the financial statements under ""Southern Company Gas"" for additional information.Revenues from infrastructure replacement programs and base rate changes increased in 2019 compared to the prior year primarily due to increases of $74 million at Nicor Gas and $16 million at Atlanta Gas Light. These amounts include gas distribution operations' continued investments recovered through infrastructure replacement programs and base rate increases as well as customer refunds in 2018 as a result of the Tax Reform Legislation. See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Southern Company Gas"" for additional information.Revenues associated with gas costs and other cost recovery decreased in 2019 compared to the prior year primarily due to lower natural gas prices and decreased volumes of natural gas sold. Natural gas distribution rates include provisions to adjust billings for fluctuations in natural gas costs. Therefore, gas costs recovered through natural gas revenues generally equal the amount expensed in cost of natural gas and do not affect net income from gas distribution operations. See ""Cost of Natural Gas"" herein for additional information.Revenues from wholesale gas services increased in 2019 primarily due to derivative gains, partially offset by decreased commercial activity. See ""Segment Information – Wholesale Gas Services"" herein for additional information.Other revenues increased in 2019 primarily due to increases in customers at gas distribution operations and recovery of prior period hedge losses at gas marketing services.Heating Degree Days During Heating Season, natural gas usage and operating revenues are generally higher. Weather typically does not have a significant net income impact other than during the Heating Season. The following table presents the Heating Degree Days information for Illinois and Georgia, the primary locations where Southern Company Gas' operations are impacted by weather.

On October 2, 2019, Nicor Gas received approval for a volume balancing adjustment, a revenue decoupling mechanism for residential customers that provides a monthly benchmark level of revenue per rate class for recovery.II-49 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2019 Annual ReportSouthern Company Gas hedged its exposure to warmer-than-normal weather in Illinois for gas distribution operations and in Illinois and Georgia for gas marketing services. The remaining impacts of weather on earnings were immaterial.Customer Count The following table provides the number of customers served by Southern Company Gas at December 31, 2019 and 2018: 2019 2018 (in thousands, except market share %)Gas distribution operations 4,277 4,248Gas marketing services Energy customers(*) 631 697Market share of energy customers in Georgia 28.9% 29.0%(*)Gas marketing services' customers are primarily located in Georgia and Illinois. Also included as of December 31, 2018 were approximately 70,000 customers in Ohio contracted through an annual auction process to serve for 12 months beginning April 1, 2018.Southern Company Gas anticipates overall customer growth trends in gas distribution operations to continue as it expects continued improvement in the new housing market and low natural gas prices. Southern Company Gas uses a variety of targeted marketing programs to attract new customers and to retain existing customers. Cost of Natural Gas Excluding Atlanta Gas Light, which does not sell natural gas to end-use customers, gas distribution operations charges its utility customers for natural gas consumed using natural gas cost recovery mechanisms set by the applicable state regulatory agencies. Under these mechanisms, all prudently-incurred natural gas costs are passed through to customers without markup, subject to regulatory review. Gas distribution operations defers or accrues the difference between the actual cost of natural gas and the amount of commodity revenue earned in a given period. The deferred or accrued amount is either billed or refunded to customers prospectively through adjustments to the commodity rate. Deferred natural gas costs are reflected as regulatory assets and accrued natural gas costs are reflected as regulatory liabilities. Therefore, gas costs recovered through natural gas revenues generally equal the amount expensed in cost of natural gas and do not affect net income from gas distribution operations. Cost of natural gas at gas distribution operations represented 84.5% of the total cost of natural gas for 2019.Gas marketing services customers are charged for actual and estimated natural gas consumed. Cost of natural gas includes the cost of fuel and associated transportation costs, lost and unaccounted for gas, adjustments to reduce the value of inventories to market value, if applicable, and gains and losses associated with certain derivatives.In 2019, cost of natural gas was $1.3 billion, a decrease of $220 million, or 14.3%, compared to the prior year. Excluding a $106 million decrease related to the Southern Company Gas Dispositions, cost of natural gas decreased by $114 million, which reflects a 14.8% decrease in natural gas prices compared to 2018.II-50 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2019 Annual ReportVolumes of Natural Gas SoldThe following table details the volumes of natural gas sold during all periods presented. 2019 vs. 2018 2019 2018 % ChangeGas distribution operations (mmBtu in millions) Firm677 721 (6.1)%Interruptible92 95 (3.2)%Total(*)769 816 (5.8)%Wholesale gas services (mmBtu in millions/day) Daily physical sales6.4 6.7 (4.5)%Gas marketing services (mmBtu in millions) Firm: Georgia33 37 (10.8)%Illinois12 13 (7.7)%Other 15 20 (25.0)%Interruptible large commercial and industrial14 14 — %Total74 84 (11.9)%(*)Includes total volumes of natural gas sold of 38 mmBtu for 2018 related to Elizabethtown Gas, Elkton Gas, and Florida City Gas, which were sold in July 2018.

See Note 15 to the financial statements under ""Southern Company Gas – Sale of Pivotal Home Solutions"" for additional information.Other Operations and Maintenance ExpensesIn 2019, other operations and maintenance expenses decreased $93 million, or 9.5%, compared to the prior year. Excluding a $65 million decrease related to the Southern Company Gas Dispositions, other operations and maintenance expenses decreased $28 million. This decrease was primarily due to $28 million of disposition-related costs incurred during 2018, a $12 million adjustment in 2018 for the adoption of a new paid time off policy, an $11 million expense for a litigation settlement to facilitate the sale of Pivotal Home Solutions in 2018, and a $7 million decrease in compensation and benefits costs, partially offset by a $22 million increase in rider expenses, primarily at Nicor Gas, passed through directly to customers. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – ""Southern Company Gas – Utility Regulation and Rate Design"" herein for additional information.Depreciation and AmortizationIn 2019, depreciation and amortization decreased $13 million, or 2.6%, compared to the prior year. Excluding a $27 million decrease related to the Southern Company Gas Dispositions, depreciation and amortization increased $14 million. This increase was primarily due to continued infrastructure investments at gas distribution operations, partially offset by accelerated depreciation related to assets retired in 2018. See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Southern Company Gas – Infrastructure Replacement Programs and Capital Projects"" for additional information.Impairment ChargesIn 2019, Southern Company Gas recorded impairment charges of $91 million related to a natural gas storage facility in Louisiana and $24 million in contemplation of the sale of its interests in Pivotal LNG and Atlantic Coast Pipeline. In 2018, a goodwill impairment charge of $42 million was recorded in contemplation of the sale of Pivotal Home Solutions. See Notes 1, 3, and 15 to the financial statements under ""Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets and Liabilities,"" ""Other Matters – Southern Company Gas,"" and ""Southern Company Gas,"" respectively, for additional information.II-51 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2019 Annual Report(Gain) Loss on Dispositions, NetIn 2018, gain on dispositions, net was $291 million and was associated with the Southern Company Gas Dispositions. The income tax expense on these gains included income tax expense on goodwill not deductible for tax purposes and for which a deferred tax liability had not been recorded previously.Earnings from Equity Method InvestmentsIn 2019, earnings from equity method investments increased $9 million, or 6.1%, compared to the prior year and reflect higher earnings from SNG as a result of rate increases that became effective September 2018, partially offset by a $6 million pre-tax loss on the sale of Triton in May 2019. See Note 7 to the financial statements under ""Southern Company Gas"" for additional information.Other Income (Expense), NetIn 2019, other income (expense), net increased $19 million compared to the prior year. This increase primarily resulted from a $23 million decrease in charitable donations in 2019.Income TaxesIn 2019, income taxes decreased $334 million, or 72.0%, compared to the prior year. This decrease primarily reflects a reduction of $348 million related to the Southern Company Gas Dispositions, as well as $29 million in benefits associated with impairment charges in 2019 and additional benefits from the flowback of excess deferred income taxes in 2019 primarily at Atlanta Gas Light as previously authorized by the Georgia PSC, partially offset by $48 million of additional taxes associated with increased pre-tax earnings at wholesale gas services.See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – ""Income Tax Matters"" herein and Note 10 to the financial statements for additional information. Also see Notes 2, 3, and 15 to the financial statements under ""Southern Company Gas,"" ""Other Matters – Southern Company Gas,"" and ""Southern Company Gas – Proposed Sale of Pivotal LNG and Atlantic Coast Pipeline,"" respectively, for additional information on Atlanta Gas Light's regulatory treatment of the impacts of the Tax Reform Legislation and the impairment charges.Performance and Non-GAAP MeasuresAdjusted operating margin is a non-GAAP measure that is calculated as operating revenues less cost of natural gas, cost of other sales, and revenue tax expense. Adjusted operating margin excludes other operations and maintenance expenses, depreciation and amortization, taxes other than income taxes, impairment charges, and gain (loss) on dispositions, net, which are included in the calculation of operating income as calculated in accordance with GAAP and reflected in the statements of income. The presentation of adjusted operating margin is believed to provide useful information regarding the contribution resulting from base rate changes, infrastructure replacement programs and capital projects, and customer growth at gas distribution operations since the cost of natural gas and revenue tax expense can vary significantly and are generally billed directly to customers. Southern Company Gas further believes that utilizing adjusted operating margin at gas pipeline investments, wholesale gas services, and gas marketing services allows it to focus on a direct measure of performance before overhead costs. The applicable reconciliation of operating income to adjusted operating margin is provided herein.Adjusted operating margin should not be considered an alternative to, or a more meaningful indicator of, Southern Company Gas' operating performance than operating income as determined in accordance with GAAP. In addition, Southern Company Gas' adjusted operating margin may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.Detailed variance explanations of Southern Company Gas' financial performance are provided herein.II-52 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2019 Annual ReportReconciliations of operating income to adjusted operating margin are as follows: 2019 2018 (in millions)Operating Income$770 $915Other operating expenses(a)1,703 1,443Revenue taxes(b)(114) (111)Adjusted Operating Margin$2,359 $2,247(a)Includes other operations and maintenance, depreciation and amortization, taxes other than income taxes, impairment charges, and gain (loss) on dispositions, net.(b)Nicor Gas' revenue tax expenses, which are passed through directly to customers.Segment Information 2019 2018 Adjusted Operating Margin(a) Operating Expenses(a) Net Income (Loss) Adjusted Operating Margin(a) Operating Expenses (a)(b) Net Income (Loss)(b) (in millions) (in millions)Gas distribution operations $1,799 $1,226 $337 $1,794 $890 $334Gas pipeline investments 32 12 94 32 12 103Wholesale gas services 273 54 163 134 64 38Gas marketing services 234 122 83 263 244 (40)All other 28 182 (92) 33 131 (63)Intercompany eliminations (7) (7) — (9) (9) —Consolidated $2,359 $1,589 $585 $2,247 $1,332 $372(a)Adjusted operating margin and operating expenses are adjusted for Nicor Gas' revenue tax expenses, which are passed through directly to customers.(b)Operating expenses for gas distribution operations and gas marketing services include the gain on dispositions, net. Net income for gas distribution operations and gas marketing services includes the gain on dispositions, net and the associated income tax expense. See Note 15 to the financial statements under ""Southern Company Gas"" for additional information.Gas Distribution OperationsGas distribution operations is the largest component of Southern Company Gas' business and is subject to regulation and oversight by agencies in each of the states it serves. These agencies approve natural gas rates designed to provide Southern Company Gas with the opportunity to generate revenues to recover the cost of natural gas delivered to its customers and its fixed and variable costs, including depreciation, interest expense, operations and maintenance, taxes, and overhead costs, and to earn a reasonable return on its investments.With the exception of Atlanta Gas Light, Southern Company Gas' second largest utility that operates in a deregulated natural gas market and has a straight-fixed-variable rate design that minimizes the variability of its revenues based on consumption, the earnings of the natural gas distribution utilities can be affected by customer consumption patterns that are a function of weather conditions, price levels for natural gas, and general economic conditions that may impact customers' ability to pay for natural gas consumed. Southern Company Gas has various weather mechanisms, such as weather normalization mechanisms and weather derivative instruments, that limit its exposure to weather changes within typical ranges in its natural gas distribution utilities' service territories.In July 2018, a Southern Company Gas subsidiary, Pivotal Utility Holdings, completed the sales of the assets of two of its natural gas distribution utilities, Elizabethtown Gas and Elkton Gas, to South Jersey Industries, Inc. Also in July 2018, Southern Company Gas and its wholly-owned direct subsidiary, NUI Corporation, completed the sale of Pivotal Utility Holdings, which primarily consisted of Florida City Gas, to NextEra Energy. See Note 15 to the financial statements under ""Southern Company Gas"" for additional information.II-53 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2019 Annual ReportThe following table details the results of gas distribution operations including and excluding the impact of the utilities sold in 2018.Favorable(unfavorable) 2019 vs 2018 Impacts of Utilities Sold in 2018 Variance Excluding Utilities Sold in 2018 (in millions)Adjusted Operating Margin $5 $138 $143Operating expenses (336) 246 (90)Other income (expense), net (3) — (3)Interest expenses (9) (13) (22)Income tax expense 346 (315) 31Net income $3 $56 $59Excluding the impact of the utilities sold in 2018, net income in 2019 increased $59 million, or 21.2%, compared to the prior year. The $143 million increase in adjusted operating margin reflects additional revenue from base rate increases and continued investment recovered through infrastructure replacement programs, a decrease in refunds associated with bad debt riders, and the customer refunds in 2018 as a result of the Tax Reform Legislation. The $90 million increase in operating expenses includes increases in compensation and benefit costs and rider expenses passed through directly to customers, as well as additional depreciation primarily due to additional assets placed in service. The $3 million decrease in other income (expense), net is primarily due to a contractor litigation settlement in 2018. The $22 million increase in interest expense is primarily from the issuance of first mortgage bonds at Nicor Gas. The $31 million decrease in income tax expense is primarily due to an increase in the flowback of excess deferred income taxes in 2019 primarily at Atlanta Gas Light. See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Southern Company Gas – Rate Proceedings – Atlanta Gas Light"" and "" – Infrastructure Replacement Programs and Capital Projects – Atlanta Gas Light – PRP"" herein for additional information on Atlanta Gas Light's stipulation reflecting the impacts of the Tax Reform Legislation and the contractor litigation settlement, respectively.Gas Pipeline InvestmentsGas pipeline investments consists primarily of joint ventures in natural gas pipeline investments including SNG, Atlantic Coast Pipeline, PennEast Pipeline, and Dalton Pipeline. See Note 7 to the financial statements under ""Southern Company Gas"" for additional information.Net income in 2019 decreased $9 million, or 8.7%, compared to the prior year. This decrease primarily relates to an increase in tax expense due to changes in state apportionment rates, partially offset by higher earnings from SNG.Wholesale Gas ServicesWholesale gas services is involved in asset management and optimization, storage, transportation, producer and peaking services, natural gas supply, natural gas services, and wholesale gas marketing. Southern Company Gas has positioned the business to generate positive economic earnings on an annual basis even under low volatility market conditions that can result from a number of factors. When market price volatility increases, wholesale gas services is well positioned to capture significant value and generate stronger results. Operating expenses primarily reflect employee compensation and benefits.Net income in 2019 increased $125 million, or 328.9%, compared to the prior year. This increase primarily relates to a $139 million increase in adjusted operating margin, a $10 million decrease in operating expenses, and a $20 million increase in other income (expense), partially offset by a $48 million increase in income taxes.II-54 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2019 Annual ReportDetails of adjusted operating margin are provided in the table below. 2019 2018 (in millions)Commercial activity recognized$54 $254Gain on storage derivatives40 9Gain (loss) on transportation and forward commodity derivatives186 (119)LOCOM adjustments, net of current period recoveries(16) (7)Purchase accounting adjustments to fair value inventory and contracts9 (3)Adjusted operating margin$273 $134Change in Commercial ActivityThe commercial activity at wholesale gas services includes recognition of storage and transportation values that were generated in prior periods, which reflect the impact of prior period hedge gains and losses as associated physical transactions occur. The decrease in commercial activity in 2019 compared to the prior year was primarily due to significant natural gas price volatility that resulted from prolonged cold weather during 2018 coupled with low natural gas supply.Change in Storage and Transportation DerivativesVolatility in the natural gas market arises from a number of factors, such as weather fluctuations or changes in supply or demand for natural gas in different regions of the U.S. The volatility of natural gas commodity prices has a significant impact on Southern Company Gas' customer rates, long-term competitive position against other energy sources, and the ability of wholesale gas services to capture value from locational and seasonal spreads. Forward storage or time spreads applicable to the locations of wholesale gas services' specific storage positions in 2019 resulted in storage derivative gains. Transportation and forward commodity derivative gains in 2019 are primarily the result of narrowing transportation spreads due to supply constraints and increases in natural gas supply, which impacted forward prices at natural gas receipt and delivery points, primarily in the Northeast and Midwest regions.The natural gas that wholesale gas services purchases and injects into storage is accounted for at the LOCOM value utilizing gas daily or spot prices at the end of the year. See Note 1 to the financial statements under ""Natural Gas for Sale"" for additional information.Withdrawal Schedule and Physical Transportation TransactionsThe expected natural gas withdrawals from storage and expected offset to prior hedge losses/gains associated with the transportation portfolio of wholesale gas services are presented in the following table, along with the net operating revenues expected at the time of withdrawal from storage and the physical flow of natural gas between contracted transportation receipt and delivery points. Wholesale gas services' expected net operating revenues exclude storage and transportation demand charges, as well as other variable fuel, withdrawal, receipt, and delivery charges, and exclude estimated profit sharing under asset management agreements. Further, the amounts that are realizable in future periods are based on the inventory withdrawal schedule, planned physical flow of natural gas between the transportation receipt and delivery points, and forward natural gas prices at December 31, 2019. A portion of wholesale gas services' storage inventory and transportation capacity is economically hedged with futures contracts, which results in the realization of substantially fixed net operating revenues.II-55 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2019 Annual Report Storage Withdrawal Total storage(a) Expected net operating losses(b) Physical Transportation Transactions – Expected Net Operating Gains(c) (in mmBtu in millions) (in millions) (in millions)202061 $6 $(119)2021 and thereafter— — (67)Total at December 31, 201961 $6 $(186)(a)At December 31, 2019, the WACOG of wholesale gas services' expected natural gas withdrawals from storage was $1.87 per mmBtu.(b)Represents expected operating losses from planned storage withdrawals associated with existing inventory positions and could change as wholesale gas services adjusts its daily injection and withdrawal plans in response to changes in future market conditions and forward NYMEX price fluctuations. (c)Represents the expected net gains during the periods in which the derivatives will be settled and the physical transportation transactions will occur that offset the derivative gains and losses previously recognized.Gas Marketing ServicesGas marketing services provides energy-related products and services to natural gas markets and participants in customer choice programs that were approved in various states to increase competition. These programs allow customers to choose their natural gas supplier while the local distribution utility continues to provide distribution and transportation services. Gas marketing services is weather sensitive and uses a variety of hedging strategies, such as weather derivative instruments and other risk management tools, to partially mitigate potential weather impacts.On June 4, 2018, Southern Company Gas completed the sale of Pivotal Home Solutions to American Water Enterprises LLC. See Note 15 under ""Southern Company Gas – Sale of Pivotal Home Solutions"" for additional information.Net income increased $123 million in 2019 compared to the prior year. This increase primarily relates to a $122 million decrease in operating expenses and a $27 million decrease in income tax expense, partially offset by a $29 million decrease in adjusted operating margin.Excluding a $43 million decrease attributable to the 2018 disposition of Pivotal Home Solutions, adjusted operating margin increased $14 million, which primarily reflects favorable margins and recovery of prior period hedge losses. Excluding a $116 million decrease attributable to the 2018 disposition of Pivotal Home Solutions that includes the related goodwill impairment charge, operating expense decreased $6 million due to lower amortization of intangible assets. Excluding a $33 million decrease attributable to the 2018 disposition of Pivotal Home Solutions, income tax expense increased $6 million primarily due to higher pre-tax earnings.All OtherAll other includes Southern Company Gas' storage and fuels operations and its investment in Triton through completion of its sale on May 29, 2019, AGL Services Company, and Southern Company Gas Capital, as well as various corporate operating expenses that are not allocated to the reportable segments and interest income (expense) associated with affiliate financing arrangements.Net loss increased $29 million, or 46.0%, in 2019 compared to the prior year. This increase primarily reflects a $51 million increase in operating expenses, partially offset by a $39 million decrease in income taxes. The increase in operating expenses primarily reflects a $91 million impairment charge related to a natural gas storage facility in Louisiana and a $24 million impairment charge in contemplation of the sale of Southern Company Gas' interests in Pivotal LNG and Atlantic Coast Pipeline, partially offset by a $12 million one-time adjustment in the first quarter 2018 for the adoption of a new paid time off policy, $28 million of disposition-related costs incurred during 2018, and a $14 million decrease in depreciation and amortization. The decrease in income taxes reflects a $29 million benefit due to the impairment charge, a $13 million benefit related to the reversal of a federal income tax valuation allowance in connection with the sale of Triton, the impact of deferred tax expenses related to the enactment of the State of Illinois income tax legislation in 2018, and changes in state income tax apportionment factors in several states during 2019.

The effects of inflation can create an economic loss since the recovery of costs could be in dollars that have less purchasing power. Southern Power is party to long-term contracts reflecting market-based rates, including inflation expectations. Any adverse effect of inflation on the Registrants' results of operations has not been substantial in recent years. See Note 2 to the financial statements for additional information on rate regulation.FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIALGeneralPrices for electric service provided by the traditional electric operating companies and natural gas distributed by the natural gas distribution utilities to retail customers are set by state PSCs or other applicable state regulatory agencies under cost-based regulatory principles. Retail rates and earnings are reviewed and may be adjusted periodically within certain limitations. Prices for wholesale electricity sales, interconnecting transmission lines, and the exchange of electric power are regulated by the FERC. Southern Power continues to focus on long-term PPAs. See ACCOUNTING POLICIES – ""Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – Utility Regulation"" herein and Note 2 to the financial statements for additional information about regulatory matters.Each Registrant's results of operations are not necessarily indicative of its future earnings potential. Recent disposition activities described under ""Acquisitions and Dispositions"" herein and in Note 15 to the financial statements will impact future earnings for the applicable Registrants. The level of the Registrants' future earnings depends on numerous factors that affect the opportunities, challenges, and risks of the Registrants' primary businesses of selling electricity and/or distributing natural gas, as described further herein.For the traditional electric operating companies, these factors include the ability to maintain constructive regulatory environments that allow for the timely recovery of prudently-incurred costs during a time of increasing costs, continued customer growth, and the trend of reduced electricity usage per customer, especially in residential and commercial markets. Other major factors include Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 construction and rate recovery related thereto for Georgia Power and the ability to prevail against legal challenges associated with the Kemper County energy facility for Mississippi Power.II-57 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2019 Annual ReportEarnings in the electricity business will also depend upon maintaining and growing sales, considering, among other things, the adoption and/or penetration rates of increasingly energy-efficient technologies, increasing volumes of electronic commerce transactions, and, for Georgia Power, more multi-family home construction, all of which could contribute to a net reduction in customer usage.The level of future earnings for Southern Power's competitive wholesale electric business depends on numerous factors including Southern Power's ability to execute its growth strategy through the development or acquisition of renewable facilities and other energy projects while containing costs, as well as regulatory matters, creditworthiness of customers, total electric generating capacity available in Southern Power's market areas, and Southern Power's ability to successfully remarket capacity as current contracts expire. In addition, renewable portfolio standards, transmission constraints, cost of generation from units within the Southern Company power pool, and operational limitations could influence Southern Power's future earnings.The level of future earnings for Southern Company Gas' primary business of distributing natural gas and its complementary businesses in the gas pipeline investments, wholesale gas services, and gas marketing services sectors depends on numerous factors. These factors include the natural gas distribution utilities' ability to maintain constructive regulatory environments that allow for the timely recovery of prudently-incurred costs, the completion and subsequent operation of ongoing infrastructure and other construction projects, creditworthiness of customers, and Southern Company Gas' ability to optimize its transportation and storage positions and to re-contract storage rates at favorable prices. The volatility of natural gas prices has an impact on Southern Company Gas' customer rates, its long-term competitive position against other energy sources, and the ability of Southern Company Gas' gas marketing services and wholesale gas services businesses to capture value from locational and seasonal spreads. Additionally, changes in commodity prices subject a portion of Southern Company Gas' operations to earnings variability. Over the longer term, volatility is expected to be low to moderate and locational and/or transportation spreads are expected to decrease as new pipelines are built to reduce the existing supply constraints in the shale areas of the Northeast U.S. To the extent these pipelines are further delayed or not built, volatility could increase. See ""Construction Programs"" herein for additional information on permitting challenges experienced by the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and the PennEast Pipeline. Additional economic factors may contribute to this environment, including a significant drop in oil and natural gas prices, which could lead to consolidation of natural gas producers or reduced levels of natural gas production. Further, if economic conditions continue to improve, the demand for natural gas may increase, which may cause natural gas prices to rise and drive higher volatility in the natural gas markets on a longer-term basis.Earnings for both the electricity and natural gas businesses are subject to a variety of other factors. These factors include weather, competition, developing new and maintaining existing energy contracts and associated load requirements with wholesale customers, energy conservation practiced by customers, the use of alternative energy sources by customers, the prices of electricity and natural gas, and the price elasticity of demand. Demand for electricity and natural gas in the Registrants' service territories is primarily driven by the pace of economic growth or decline that may be affected by changes in regional and global economic conditions, which may impact future earnings.Mississippi Power provides service under long-term contracts with rural electric cooperative associations and municipalities located in southeastern Mississippi under cost-based electric tariffs which are subject to regulation by the FERC. The contracts with these wholesale customers represented 15.7% of Mississippi Power's total operating revenues in 2019 and are generally subject to 10-year rolling cancellation notices. Historically, these wholesale customers have acted as a group and any changes in contractual relationships for one customer are likely to be followed by the other wholesale customers.As part of its ongoing effort to adapt to changing market conditions, Southern Company continues to evaluate and consider a wide array of potential business strategies. These strategies may include business combinations, partnerships, and acquisitions involving other utility or non-utility businesses or properties, disposition of certain assets or businesses, internal restructuring, or some combination thereof. Furthermore, Southern Company may engage in new business ventures that arise from competitive and regulatory changes in the utility industry. Pursuit of any of the above strategies, or any combination thereof, may significantly affect the business operations, risks, and financial condition of Southern Company. In addition, Southern Power and Southern Company Gas regularly consider and evaluate joint development arrangements as well as acquisitions and dispositions of businesses and assets as part of their business strategies. See ""Acquisitions and Dispositions"" herein and Note 15 to the financial statements for additional information.II-58 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2019 Annual ReportAcquisitions and DispositionsSee Note 15 to the financial statements for additional information.Southern CompanyOn January 1, 2019, Southern Company completed the sale of Gulf Power to NextEra Energy for an aggregate cash purchase price of approximately $5.8 billion (less $1.3 billion of indebtedness assumed), including the final working capital adjustments. The gain associated with the sale of Gulf Power totaled $2.6 billion pre-tax ($1.4 billion after tax). In 2018, net income attributable to Gulf Power was $160 million.Alabama PowerOn September 6, 2019, Alabama Power entered into a purchase and sale agreement (Autauga Combined Cycle Acquisition) to acquire all of the equity interests in Tenaska Alabama II Partners, L.P. Tenaska Alabama II Partners, L.P. owns and operates an approximately 885-MW combined cycle generation facility in Autauga County, Alabama. The transaction is expected to close by September 1, 2020. As part of the Autauga Combined Cycle Acquisition, Alabama Power will assume an existing power sales agreement under which the full output of the generating facility remains committed to another third party for its remaining term of approximately three years. The estimated revenues from the power sales agreement are expected to offset the associated costs of operation during the remaining term.The completion of the Autauga Combined Cycle Acquisition is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions, including, among other customary conditions, approval by the Alabama PSC and the FERC. Alabama Power expects to obtain all regulatory approvals by the end of the third quarter 2020.The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.Southern PowerAcquisitionsDuring 2019, Southern Power acquired a controlling interest in the fuel cell generation facility listed below and acquired the Skookumchuck wind facility discussed under ""Construction Programs – Southern Power"" herein. Acquisition-related costs were expensed as incurred and were not material.Project FacilityResourceApproximate Nameplate Capacity (MW)LocationSouthern Power OwnershipPercentageCODPPA CounterpartyPPA Remaining PeriodDSGP(a)Fuel Cell28Delaware100% of Class BN/A(b)Delmarva Power & Light15 years(a)During 2019, Southern Power made a total investment of approximately $167 million in DSGP and now holds a controlling interest and consolidates 100% of DSGP's operating results. Southern Power records net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for approximately 10 MWs of the facility.(b)Southern Power's 18-MW share of the facility was repowered between June and August 2019. In December 2019, a Class C member joined the existing partnership between the Class A member and Southern Power and made an investment to repower the remaining 10 MWs. In connection with the Class C member joining the partnership, the original fuel cells (before repower), which had a carrying value of approximately $55 million, were distributed to the Class A member in a non-cash transaction that was excluded from the statements of cash flows.Development ProjectsSouthern Power continues to evaluate and refine the deployment of the remaining wind turbine equipment purchased in 2016 and 2017 to development and construction projects. Wind projects utilizing equipment purchased in 2016 and 2017, and reaching commercial operation by the end of 2020 and 2021, are expected to qualify for 100% and 80% PTCs, respectively. The significant majority of this equipment either has been deployed to completed projects, projects under construction, or projects that are probable of being completed or has been sold to third parties. Sales during 2019 resulted in gains totaling approximately $17 million.Sales of Renewable Facility InterestsIn May 2018, Southern Power completed the sale of a noncontrolling 33% equity interest in SP Solar, a limited partnership indirectly owning substantially all of Southern Power's solar facilities, to Global Atlantic for approximately $1.2 billion. Since Southern Power retained control of the limited partnership through its wholly-owned general partner, the sale was recorded as an II-59 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2019 Annual Reportequity transaction. Cash distributions from SP Solar are allocated 67% to Southern Power and 33% to Global Atlantic in accordance with their partnership ownership interests.In December 2018, Southern Power completed the sale of a noncontrolling tax equity interest in SP Wind, which owns a portfolio of eight operating wind facilities, to three financial investors for approximately $1.2 billion. The tax equity investors together will generally receive 40% of the cash distributions from available cash and will receive 99% of the tax attributes, including future PTCs.Southern Power consolidates each entity, as the primary beneficiary of the VIE, since it controls the most significant activities, including operating and maintaining the assets.Sales of Natural Gas and Biomass PlantsIn December 2018, Southern Power completed the sale of all of its equity interests in the Florida Plants to NextEra Energy for $203 million, including working capital adjustments. In contemplation of this sale transaction, Southern Power recorded an asset impairment charge of approximately $119 million ($89 million after tax) in May 2018. Pre-tax net income for the Florida Plants was $49 million for the period from January 1, 2018 to December 4, 2018.On June 13, 2019, Southern Power completed the sale of its equity interests in Plant Nacogdoches, a 115-MW biomass facility located in Nacogdoches County, Texas, to Austin Energy, for a purchase price of approximately $461 million, including working capital adjustments. Southern Power recorded a gain of $23 million ($88 million after tax) on the sale. The pre-tax net income for Plant Nacogdoches was $13 million and $27 million for the period from January 1, 2019 to June 13, 2019 and for the year ended 2018, respectively.On January 17, 2020, Southern Power completed the sale of its equity interests in Plant Mankato (including the 385-MW expansion unit completed in May 2019) to a subsidiary of Xcel for a purchase price of approximately $663 million, including estimated working capital adjustments. The sale resulted in a gain of approximately $39 million ($23 million after tax) in 2020. Pre-tax net income for Plant Mankato was $29 million and immaterial for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The assets and liabilities of Plant Mankato are classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2019 and 2018.Southern Company GasIn June 2018, Southern Company Gas completed the stock sale of Pivotal Home Solutions to American Water Enterprises LLC. Southern Company Gas and American Water Enterprises LLC entered into a transition services agreement whereby Southern Company Gas provided certain administrative and operational services through November 4, 2018.In July 2018, a Southern Company Gas subsidiary, Pivotal Utility Holdings, completed the sales of the assets of two of its natural gas distribution utilities, Elizabethtown Gas and Elkton Gas, to South Jersey Industries, Inc. Southern Company Gas and South Jersey Industries, Inc. entered into transition services agreements whereby Southern Company Gas will provide certain administrative and operational services through no later than July 31, 2020.In July 2018, Southern Company Gas and its wholly-owned direct subsidiary, NUI Corporation, completed the stock sale of Pivotal Utility Holdings, which primarily consisted of Florida City Gas, to NextEra Energy. Southern Company Gas and NextEra Energy entered into a transition services agreement whereby Southern Company Gas will provide certain administrative and operational services through no later than July 29, 2020.The Southern Company Gas Dispositions resulted in a net loss of $51 million in 2018, which includes $342 million of tax expense. The after-tax impacts of these dispositions included income tax expense on goodwill not deductible for tax purposes and for which a deferred tax liability had not been recorded previously. In addition, a goodwill impairment charge of $42 million was recorded during 2018 in contemplation of the sale of Pivotal Home Solutions.The Southern Company Gas Dispositions materially decreased Southern Company Gas' subsequent earnings and cash flows. For the year ended December 31, 2018, pre-tax earnings attributable to these dispositions were $297 million, which includes a $291 million gain on dispositions, net and a $42 million goodwill impairment. Due to the seasonal nature of the natural gas business and other factors including, but not limited to, weather, regulation, competition, customer demand, and general economic conditions, these results are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any other period.On May 29, 2019, Southern Company Gas sold its investment in Triton, a cargo container leasing company. This disposition resulted in a pre-tax loss of $6 million and a net after-tax gain of $7 million as a result of reversing a $13 million federal income tax valuation allowance.On February 7, 2020, Southern Company Gas entered into agreements with Dominion Modular LNG Holdings, Inc. and Dominion Atlantic Coast Pipeline, LLC for the sale of its interests in Pivotal LNG and Atlantic Coast Pipeline, respectively, for an II-60 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2019 Annual Reportaggregate purchase price of $165 million, including estimated working capital and timing adjustments. Southern Company Gas may also receive two payments of $5 million each, contingent upon certain milestones related to Pivotal LNG being met by Dominion Modular LNG Holdings, Inc. after the completion of the sale. Based on the terms of these pending transactions, Southern Company Gas recorded an asset impairment charge, exclusive of the contingent payments, for Pivotal LNG of approximately $24 million ($17 million after tax) as of December 31, 2019. The completion of each transaction is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions, including, among other customary closing conditions, the completion of the other transaction and, for the sale of the interest in Atlantic Coast Pipeline, the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976. The transactions are expected to be completed in the first half of 2020; however, the ultimate outcome cannot be determined at this time. The assets and liabilities of Pivotal LNG and the interest in Atlantic Coast Pipeline are classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2019. See Notes 3, 7, and 15 to the financial statements under ""Southern Company Gas – Gas Pipeline Projects,"" ""Southern Company Gas – Equity Method Investments,"" and ""Southern Company Gas – Proposed Sale of Pivotal LNG and Atlantic Coast Pipeline,"" respectively, for additional information.Environmental MattersThe Southern Company system's operations are regulated by state and federal environmental agencies through a variety of laws and regulations governing air, water, land, and other natural resources. The Southern Company system maintains comprehensive environmental compliance and GHG strategies to assess both current and upcoming requirements and compliance costs associated with these environmental laws and regulations. The costs required to comply with environmental laws and regulations and to achieve stated goals, including capital expenditures, operations and maintenance costs, and costs reflected in ARO liabilities, may impact future electric generating unit retirement and replacement decisions, results of operations, cash flows, and/or financial condition. Related costs may result from the installation of additional environmental controls, closure and monitoring of CCR facilities, unit retirements, or changing fuel sources for certain existing units, as well as related upgrades to the Southern Company system's transmission and distribution (electric and natural gas) systems. A major portion of these costs is expected to be recovered through retail and wholesale rates, including existing ratemaking and billing provisions. The ultimate impact of environmental laws and regulations and the GHG goals discussed herein will depend on various factors, such as state adoption and implementation of requirements, the availability and cost of any deployed technology, fuel prices, and the outcome of pending and/or future legal challenges.New or revised environmental laws and regulations could affect many areas of operations for the Subsidiary Registrants. The impact of any such changes cannot be determined at this time. Environmental compliance costs could affect earnings if such costs cannot continue to be recovered on a timely basis in rates for the traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities or through long-term wholesale agreements for the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power.Alabama Power and Mississippi Power recover environmental compliance costs through separate mechanisms, Rate CNP Compliance and the ECO Plan, respectively. Georgia Power's base rates include an Environmental Compliance Cost Recovery (ECCR) tariff that allows for the recovery of environmental compliance costs. The natural gas distribution utilities of Southern Company Gas generally recover environmental remediation expenditures through rate mechanisms approved by their applicable state regulatory agencies. See Notes 2 and 3 to the financial statements for additional information.Southern Power's PPAs generally contain provisions that permit charging the counterparty with some of the new costs incurred as a result of changes in environmental laws and regulations. Since Southern Power's units are newer natural gas and renewable generating facilities, costs associated with environmental compliance for these facilities have been less significant than for similarly situated coal or older natural gas generating facilities. Environmental, natural resource, and land use concerns, including the applicability of air quality limitations, the potential presence of wetlands or threatened and endangered species, the availability of water withdrawal rights, uncertainties regarding impacts such as increased light or noise, and concerns about potential adverse health impacts can, however, increase the cost of siting and operating any type of future electric generating facility. The impact of such laws, regulations, and other considerations on Southern Power and subsequent recovery through PPA provisions cannot be determined at this time.Further, increased costs that are recovered through regulated rates could contribute to reduced demand for electricity and natural gas, which could negatively affect results of operations, cash flows, and/or financial condition. Additionally, many commercial and industrial customers may also be affected by existing and future environmental requirements, which for some may have the potential to affect their demand for electricity and natural gas.Although the timing, requirements, and estimated costs could change as environmental laws and regulations are adopted or modified, as compliance plans are revised or updated, and as legal challenges to rules are initiated or completed, estimated capital II-61 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2019 Annual Reportexpenditures through 2024 based on the current environmental compliance strategy for the Southern Company system and the traditional electric operating companies are as follows: 20202021202220232024Total (in millions)Southern Company$223$250$244$214$131$1,062Alabama Power80778297103439Georgia Power11515615210523551Mississippi Power28171012572These estimates do not include any costs associated with potential regulation of GHG emissions. See ""Global Climate Issues"" herein for additional information. The Southern Company system also anticipates substantial expenditures associated with ash pond closure and ground water monitoring under the CCR Rule and related state rules, which are reflected in the applicable Registrants' ARO liabilities. See FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY – ""Capital Requirements"" herein and Note 6 to the financial statements for additional information.Environmental Laws and RegulationsAir QualityThe Southern Company system reduced SO2 and NOX air emissions by 98% and 88%, respectively, from 1990 to 2018. The Southern Company system reduced mercury air emissions by over 96% from 2005 to 2018.The EPA finalized regional haze regulations in 2005 and 2017. These regulations require states, tribal governments, and various federal agencies to develop and implement plans to reduce pollutants that impair visibility and demonstrate reasonable progress toward the goal of restoring natural visibility conditions in certain areas, including national parks and wilderness areas. States are required to submit state implementation plans for the second ten-year planning period (2018 through 2028) by July 31, 2021. These plans could require further reductions in particulate matter, SO2, and/or NOX, which could result in increased compliance costs at affected electric generating units.Water QualityIn 2014, the EPA finalized requirements under Section 316(b) of the Clean Water Act (CWA) to regulate cooling water intake structures (CWIS) to minimize their effects on fish and other aquatic life at existing power plants. The regulation requires plant-specific studies to determine applicable CWIS changes to protect organisms. The Southern Company system is conducting these studies and currently anticipates applicable CWIS changes may include fish-friendly CWIS screens with fish return systems and minor additions of monitoring equipment at certain plants. The impact of this rule will depend on the outcome of these plant-specific studies, any additional protective measures required to be incorporated into each plant's National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit based on site-specific factors, and the outcome of any legal challenges.In 2015, the EPA finalized the steam electric effluent limitations guidelines (ELG) rule (2015 ELG Rule) that set national standards for wastewater discharges from new and existing steam electric generating units generating greater than 50 MWs. The 2015 ELG Rule prohibits effluent discharges of certain waste streams and imposes stringent limits on flue gas desulfurization (scrubber) wastewater discharges. The 2015 technology-based limits and the CCR Rule require extensive changes to existing ash and wastewater management systems or the installation and operation of new ash and wastewater management systems. Compliance with the 2015 ELG Rule is expected to require capital expenditures and increased operational costs for the traditional electric operating companies' coal-fired electric generation. State environmental agencies will incorporate specific compliance applicability dates in the NPDES permitting process for each ELG waste stream. On November 22, 2019, the EPA published a proposed rule that changes certain requirements in the 2015 ELG Rule, including adjusting compliance limits and providing certain exemptions for boilers that are expected to be retired by December 31, 2028 and for low utilization boilers (876,000 MWh/year or less). The proposal also extends the latest applicability date for flue gas desulfurization wastewater to December 31, 2025 but retains the latest applicability date of December 31, 2023 for bottom ash transport water. The impact of any changes to the 2015 ELG Rule will depend on the content of a new final rule, which the EPA plans to finalize by August 2020, and the outcome of any legal challenges.Coal Combustion ResidualsIn 2015, the EPA finalized non-hazardous solid waste regulations for the disposal of CCR, including coal ash and gypsum, in landfills and surface impoundments (ash ponds) at active electric generating power plants. The CCR Rule requires landfills and II-62 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2019 Annual Reportash ponds to be evaluated against a set of performance criteria and potentially closed if certain criteria are not met. Closure of existing landfills and ash ponds requires installation of equipment and infrastructure to manage CCR in accordance with the CCR Rule. In addition to the CCR Rule, the States of Alabama and Georgia finalized state regulations regarding the handling of CCR within their respective states. The State of Georgia received approval from the EPA on its partial permit program implementing the state CCR permit program in lieu of the federal self-implementing rule in accordance with the Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation Act. The State of Alabama also submitted its state CCR program for the EPA's review and approval. The State of Mississippi has not yet developed a state CCR permit program.The EPA is in the process of amending portions of the CCR Rule. Most recently, on December 2, 2019, the EPA published a proposed rule that would require facilities to cease placement of both CCR and non-CCR waste in unlined surface impoundments as soon as technically feasible, no later than August 31, 2020. This proposed rule also includes extensions beyond August 31, 2020, provided that certain conditions are met. Impacts of the proposed rule to the Southern Company system are expected to be limited, as the traditional electric operating companies and SEGCO stopped sending coal ash from most of the generating units to unlined ponds in April 2019 and expect to stop sending coal ash from the remaining generating units within the timeframes and associated extensions allowed in the proposed rule.Based on cost estimates for closure and monitoring of landfills and ash ponds pursuant to the CCR Rule, the Southern Company system recorded/revised AROs for each CCR unit in 2015 and has continued to update these cost estimates and ARO liabilities in subsequent years. The traditional electric operating companies expect to continue updating these estimates periodically as additional information related to ash pond closure methodologies, schedules, and/or costs becomes available. Alabama Power anticipates increasing the ARO for one of its ash ponds within the next nine months upon completion of a feasibility study and the related cost estimate, and the increase could be material. Additionally, the closure designs and plans in the States of Alabama and Georgia are subject to approval by environmental regulatory agencies. Absent continued recovery of ARO costs through regulated rates, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition for Southern Company and the traditional electric operating companies could be materially impacted. See FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY – ""Capital Requirements"" and FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – ""Regulatory Matters – Georgia Power – Integrated Resource Plan"" herein and Note 6 to the financial statements for additional information.The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.Environmental RemediationThe Southern Company system must comply with environmental laws and regulations governing the handling and disposal of waste and releases of hazardous substances. Under these various laws and regulations, the Southern Company system could incur substantial costs to clean up affected sites. The traditional electric operating companies and Southern Company Gas conduct studies to determine the extent of any required cleanup and have recognized the estimated costs to clean up known impacted sites in their financial statements. Amounts for cleanup and ongoing monitoring costs were not material for any year presented. The traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities in Illinois and Georgia (which represent substantially all of Southern Company Gas' accrued remediation costs) have all received authority from their respective state PSCs or other applicable state regulatory agencies to recover approved environmental compliance costs through regulatory mechanisms. These regulatory mechanisms are adjusted annually or as necessary within limits approved by the state PSCs or other applicable state regulatory agencies. The traditional electric operating companies and Southern Company Gas may be liable for some or all required cleanup costs for additional sites that may require environmental remediation. See Note 3 to the financial statements under ""Environmental Remediation"" for additional information.Global Climate IssuesOn July 8, 2019, the EPA published the final Affordable Clean Energy rule (ACE Rule) to repeal and replace the CPP. The ACE Rule requires states to develop unit-specific CO2 emission rate standards for existing coal-fired units based on heat-rate efficiency improvements. The ACE Rule is being challenged in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals and Georgia Power is an intervenor in the litigation in support of the rule, as are other industry parties. The ultimate impact of the ACE Rule to the Southern Company system will depend on state implementation plan requirements and the outcome of associated legal challenges and cannot be determined at this time.Additional GHG policies, including legislation, may emerge in the future requiring the United States to transition to a lower GHG emitting economy; however, associated impacts are currently unknown. The Southern Company system has transitioned from an electric generating mix of 70% coal and 15% natural gas in 2007 to a mix of 22% coal and 52% natural gas in 2019, along with over 8,300 MWs of renewable resources. This transition has been supported in part by the Southern Company system retiring over 5,600 MWs of coal- and oil-fired generating capacity since 2010 and converting over 3,400 MWs of generating capacity from coal to natural gas since 2015. In addition, Southern Company Gas has replaced approximately 5,600 miles of bare steel and II-63 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2019 Annual Reportcast-iron pipe, resulting in removal of approximately 2.5 million metric tons of GHG from its natural gas distribution system since 1998.The following table provides the Registrants' 2018 and preliminary 2019 GHG emissions based on ownership or financial control of facilities: 2018Preliminary 2019 (in million metric tons of CO2 equivalent)Southern Company(a)(b)10288Alabama Power3632Georgia Power3027Mississippi Power89Southern Power(b)1413Southern Company Gas(b)11(a)Includes non-registrant subsidiaries.(b)The 2018 and preliminary 2019 amounts include GHG emissions attributable to disposed assets through the date of the applicable disposition. See Note 15 to the financial statements for additional information regarding disposition activities.Based on the preliminary 2019 amount above, the Southern Company system has achieved an estimated GHG emission reduction of 44% since 2007. In April 2018, Southern Company established an intermediate goal of a 50% reduction in carbon emissions from 2007 levels by 2030 and a long-term goal of low- to no-carbon operations by 2050. The Southern Company system's ability to achieve these goals depends on many external factors, including supportive national energy policies, low natural gas prices, and the development, deployment, and advancement of relevant energy technologies. The Southern Company system expects to continue cost-effectively growing its renewable energy portfolio, optimizing technology advancements to modernize its transmission and distribution systems, increasing the use of natural gas for generation, completing Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, investing in energy efficiency, and continuing research and development efforts focused on technologies to lower GHG emissions. The Southern Company system is also evaluating methods of removing carbon from the atmosphere.Regulatory MattersAlabama PowerAlabama Power's revenues from regulated retail operations are collected through various rate mechanisms subject to the oversight of the Alabama PSC. Alabama Power currently recovers its costs from the regulated retail business primarily through Rate RSE, Rate CNP, Rate ECR, and Rate NDR. In addition, the Alabama PSC issues accounting orders to address current events impacting Alabama Power. See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Alabama Power"" for additional information regarding Alabama Power's rate mechanisms and accounting orders.Petition for Certificate of Convenience and NecessityOn September 6, 2019, Alabama Power filed a petition for a CCN with the Alabama PSC for authorization to procure additional generating capacity through the turnkey construction of a new combined cycle facility and long-term contracts for the purchase of power from others, both as more fully described below, as well as the Autauga Combined Cycle Acquisition. In addition, Alabama Power will pursue approximately 200 MWs of certain demand side management and distributed energy resource programs. This filing was predicated on the results of Alabama Power's 2019 IRP provided to the Alabama PSC, which identified an approximately 2,400-MW resource need for Alabama Power, driven by the need for additional winter reserve capacity. See Note 15 to the financial statements under ""Alabama Power"" for additional information regarding the Autauga Combined Cycle Acquisition.The procurement of these resources is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions, including, among other customary conditions, approval by the Alabama PSC. The completion of the Autauga Combined Cycle Acquisition is also subject to approval by the FERC. Alabama Power expects to obtain all regulatory approvals by the end of the third quarter 2020.On May 8, 2019, Alabama Power entered into an Agreement for Engineering, Procurement, and Construction with Mitsubishi Hitachi Power Systems Americas, Inc. and Black & Veatch Construction, Inc. to construct an approximately 720-MW combined cycle facility at Plant Barry (Plant Barry Unit 8), which is expected to be placed in service by the end of 2023.II-64 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2019 Annual ReportThe capital investment associated with the construction of Plant Barry Unit 8 and the Autauga Combined Cycle Acquisition is currently estimated to total approximately $1.1 billion.Alabama Power entered into additional long-term PPAs totaling approximately 640 MWs of generating capacity consisting of approximately 240 MWs of combined cycle generation expected to begin later in 2020 and approximately 400 MWs of solar generation coupled with battery energy storage systems (solar/battery systems) expected to begin in 2022 through 2024. The terms of the agreements for the solar/battery systems permit Alabama Power to use the energy and retire the associated renewable energy credits (REC) in service of customers or to sell RECs, separately or bundled with energy.Upon certification, Alabama Power expects to recover costs associated with Plant Barry Unit 8 pursuant to its Rate CNP New Plant. Additionally, Alabama Power expects to recover costs associated with the Autauga Combined Cycle Acquisition through the inclusion in Rate RSE of revenues from the existing power sales agreement and, on expiration of that agreement, pursuant to Rate CNP New Plant. The recovery of costs associated with laws, regulations, and other such mandates directed at the utility industry are expected to be recovered through Rate CNP Compliance. Alabama Power expects to recover the capacity-related costs associated with the PPAs through its Rate CNP PPA. In addition, fuel and energy-related costs are expected to be recovered through Rate ECR. Any remaining costs associated with the Autauga Combined Cycle Acquisition and Plant Barry Unit 8 will be incorporated through the annual filing of Rate RSE.The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.Construction Work in Progress Accounting OrderOn October 1, 2019, the Alabama PSC acknowledged that Alabama Power would begin certain limited preparatory activities associated with Plant Barry Unit 8 construction to meet the target in-service date by authorizing Alabama Power to record the related costs as CWIP prior to the issuance of an order on the CCN petition. Should a CCN not be granted and Alabama Power does not proceed with the related construction of Plant Barry Unit 8, Alabama Power may transfer those costs and any costs that directly result from the non-issuance of the CCN to a regulatory asset which would be amortized over a five-year period. If the balance of incurred costs reaches 5% of the estimated in-service cost of the total project prior to issuance of an order on the CCN petition, Alabama Power will confer with the Alabama PSC regarding the appropriateness of additional authorization. The Sierra Club subsequently filed a petition for reconsideration of the accounting order. The Alabama PSC voted to deny the petition for reconsideration on January 7, 2020.Rate RSEThe Alabama PSC has adopted Rate RSE that provides for periodic annual adjustments based upon Alabama Power's projected weighted common equity return (WCER) compared to an allowable range. Rate RSE adjustments are based on forward-looking information for the applicable upcoming calendar year. Rate RSE adjustments for any two-year period, when averaged together, cannot exceed 4.0% and any annual adjustment is limited to 5.0%. When the projected WCER is under the allowed range, there is an adjusting point of 5.98% and eligibility for a performance-based adder of seven basis points, or 0.07%, to the WCER adjusting point if Alabama Power (i) has an ""A"" credit rating equivalent with at least one of the recognized rating agencies or (ii) is in the top one-third of a designated customer value benchmark survey. If Alabama Power's actual retail return is above the allowed WCER range, the excess will be refunded to customers unless otherwise directed by the Alabama PSC; however, there is no provision for additional customer billings should the actual retail return fall below the WCER range. Prior to January 2019, retail rates remained unchanged when the WCER range was between 5.75% and 6.21%. In May 2018, the Alabama PSC approved modifications to Rate RSE and other commitments designed to position Alabama Power to address the growing pressure on its credit quality resulting from the Tax Reform Legislation, without increasing retail rates under Rate RSE in the near term. Alabama Power plans to reduce growth in total debt by increasing equity, with corresponding reductions in debt issuances, thereby de-leveraging its capital structure. Alabama Power's goal is to achieve an equity ratio of approximately 55% by the end of 2025. At December 31, 2019, Alabama Power's equity ratio was approximately 50%.The approved modifications to Rate RSE began for billings in January 2019. The modifications include reducing the top of the allowed WCER range from 6.21% to 6.15% and modifications to the refund mechanism applicable to prior year actual results. The modifications to the refund mechanism allow Alabama Power to retain a portion of the revenue that causes the actual WCER for a given year to exceed the allowed range.Generally, during a year without a Rate RSE upward adjustment, if Alabama Power's actual WCER is between 6.15% and 7.65%, customers will receive 25% of the amount between 6.15% and 6.65%, 40% of the amount between 6.65% and 7.15%, and 75% of the amount between 7.15% and 7.65%. Customers will receive all amounts in excess of an actual WCER of 7.65%. During a year II-65 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2019 Annual Reportwith a Rate RSE upward adjustment, if Alabama Power's actual WCER exceeds 6.15%, customers receive 50% of the amount between 6.15% and 6.90% and all amounts in excess of an actual WCER of 6.90%.In conjunction with these modifications to Rate RSE, in May 2018, Alabama Power consented to a moratorium on any upward adjustments under Rate RSE for 2019 and 2020 and to return $50 million to customers through bill credits in 2019.On November 27, 2019, Alabama Power made its required annual Rate RSE submission to the Alabama PSC of projected data for calendar year 2020. Projected earnings were within the specified range; therefore, retail rates under Rate RSE remain unchanged for 2020.During 2019, Alabama Power provided to the Alabama PSC and the Alabama Office of the Attorney General information related to the operation and utilization of Rate RSE, in accordance with the rules governing the operation of Rate RSE. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.At December 31, 2019, Alabama Power's WCER exceeded 6.15%, resulting in Alabama Power establishing a current regulatory liability of $53 million for Rate RSE refunds, which will be refunded to customers through bill credits in April 2020.Rate CNP New PlantRate CNP New Plant allows for recovery of Alabama Power's retail costs associated with newly developed or acquired certificated generating facilities placed into retail service. No adjustments to Rate CNP New Plant occurred during the period 2017 through 2019. See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Alabama Power – Petition for Certificate of Convenience and Necessity"" for additional information.Rate CNP PPARate CNP PPA allows for the recovery of Alabama Power's retail costs associated with certificated PPAs. No adjustments to Rate CNP PPA occurred during the period 2017 through 2019 and no adjustment is expected for 2020.Rate CNP ComplianceRate CNP Compliance allows for the recovery of Alabama Power's retail costs associated with laws, regulations, and other such mandates directed at the utility industry involving the environment, security, reliability, safety, sustainability, or similar considerations impacting Alabama Power's facilities or operations. Rate CNP Compliance is based on forward-looking information and provides for the recovery of these costs pursuant to factors that are calculated and submitted to the Alabama PSC by December 1 with rates effective for the following calendar year. Compliance costs to be recovered include operations and maintenance expenses, depreciation, and a return on certain invested capital. Revenues for Rate CNP Compliance, as recorded on the financial statements, are adjusted for differences in actual recoverable costs and amounts billed in current regulated rates. Accordingly, changes in the billing factor will have no significant effect on Southern Company's or Alabama Power's revenues or net income, but will affect annual cash flow. Changes in Rate CNP Compliance-related operations and maintenance expenses and depreciation generally will have no effect on net income.On November 27, 2019, Alabama Power submitted calculations associated with its cost of complying with governmental mandates, as provided under Rate CNP Compliance. The filing reflected a projected over recovered retail revenue requirement for governmental mandates, which resulted in a rate decrease of approximately $68 million that became effective for the billing month of January 2020.Rate ECRRate ECR recovers Alabama Power's retail energy costs based on an estimate of future energy costs and the current over or under recovered balance. Revenues recognized under Rate ECR and recorded on the financial statements are adjusted for the difference in actual recoverable fuel costs and amounts billed in current regulated rates. The difference in the recoverable fuel costs and amounts billed gives rise to the over or under recovered amounts recorded as regulatory assets or liabilities. Alabama Power, along with the Alabama PSC, continually monitors the over or under recovered cost balance to determine whether an adjustment to billing rates is required. Changes in the Rate ECR factor have no significant effect on Southern Company's or Alabama Power's net income but will impact operating cash flows. The Alabama PSC may approve billing rates under Rate ECR of up to 5.910 cents per KWH.On December 3, 2019, the Alabama PSC approved a decrease to Rate ECR from 2.353 to 2.160 cents per KWH, equal to 1.82%, or approximately $102 million annually, effective January 1, 2020. The rate will adjust to 5.910 cents per KWH in January 2021 absent a further order from the Alabama PSC.II-66 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2019 Annual ReportTax Reform Accounting OrderIn May 2018, the Alabama PSC approved an accounting order that authorized Alabama Power to defer the benefits of federal excess deferred income taxes associated with the Tax Reform Legislation for the year ended December 31, 2018 as a regulatory liability and to use up to $30 million of such deferrals to offset under recovered amounts under Rate ECR. The final excess deferred tax liability for the year ended December 31, 2018 totaled approximately $69 million, of which $30 million was used to offset the Rate ECR under recovered balance. On December 3, 2019, the Alabama PSC issued an order authorizing Alabama Power to apply the remaining deferred balance of approximately $39 million to increase the balance in the NDR. See ""Rate NDR"" herein and Note 10 to the financial statements under ""Current and Deferred Income Taxes"" for additional information.Plant Greene CountyAlabama Power jointly owns Plant Greene County with an affiliate, Mississippi Power. See Note 5 to the financial statements under ""Joint Ownership Agreements"" for additional information regarding the joint ownership agreement. On December 31, 2019, Mississippi Power updated its proposed Reserve Margin Plan (RMP), originally filed in August 2018 with the Mississippi PSC. The RMP proposed a four-year acceleration of the retirement of Plant Greene County Units 1 and 2 to the third quarter 2021 and the third quarter 2022, respectively. Mississippi Power's proposed Plant Greene County unit retirements would require the completion of proposed transmission and system reliability improvements, as well as agreement by Alabama Power. Alabama Power will continue to monitor the status of Mississippi Power's proposed RMP and associated regulatory process as well as the proposed transmission and system reliability improvements. Alabama Power will review all the facts and circumstances and will evaluate all its alternatives prior to reaching a final determination on the ongoing operations of Plant Greene County. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.Rate NDRBased on an order from the Alabama PSC, Alabama Power maintains a reserve for operations and maintenance expenses to cover the cost of damages from major storms to its transmission and distribution facilities. The order approves a separate monthly Rate NDR charge to customers consisting of two components. The first component is intended to establish and maintain a reserve balance for future storms and is an on-going part of customer billing. When the reserve balance falls below $50 million, a reserve establishment charge will be activated (and the on-going reserve maintenance charge concurrently suspended) until the reserve balance reaches $75 million.The second component of the Rate NDR charge is intended to allow recovery of any existing deferred storm-related operations and maintenance costs and any future reserve deficits over a 24-month period. The Alabama PSC order gives Alabama Power authority to record a deficit balance in the NDR when costs of storm damage exceed any established reserve balance. Absent further Alabama PSC approval, the maximum total Rate NDR charge consisting of both components is $10 per month per non-residential customer account and $5 per month per residential customer account. Alabama Power has the authority, based on an order from the Alabama PSC, to accrue certain additional amounts as circumstances warrant. The order allows for reliability-related expenditures to be charged against the additional accruals when the NDR balance exceeds $75 million. Alabama Power may designate a portion of the NDR to reliability-related expenditures as a part of an annual budget process for the following year or during the current year for identified unbudgeted reliability-related expenditures that are incurred. Accruals that have not been designated can be used to offset storm charges. Additional accruals to the NDR enhance Alabama Power's ability to mitigate the financial effects of future natural disasters, promote system reliability, and offset costs retail customers would otherwise bear. As discussed herein under ""Tax Reform Accounting Order,"" in accordance with an Alabama PSC order issued on December 3, 2019, Alabama Power applied the remaining excess deferred income tax regulatory liability balance of approximately $39 million to increase the balance in the NDR. Alabama Power also accrued an additional $84 million to the NDR in December 2019 resulting in an accumulated balance of $150 million at December 31, 2019. Of this amount, Alabama Power designated $37 million to be applied to budgeted reliability-related expenditures for 2020, which is included in other regulatory liabilities, current. The remaining NDR balance of $113 million is included in other regulatory liabilities, deferred on the balance sheet.In December 2017, the reserve maintenance charge was suspended and the reserve establishment charge was activated and collected approximately $16 million annually through 2019. Effective with the March 2020 billings, the reserve establishment charge will be suspended and the reserve maintenance charge will be activated as a result of the NDR balance exceeding $75 million. Alabama Power expects to collect approximately $5 million in 2020 and $3 million annually thereafter unless the NDR balance falls below $50 million.As revenue from the Rate NDR charge is recognized, an equal amount of operations and maintenance expenses related to the NDR will also be recognized. As a result, the Rate NDR charge will not have an effect on net income but will impact operating cash flows.II-67 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2019 Annual ReportEnvironmental Accounting OrderBased on an order from the Alabama PSC (Environmental Accounting Order), Alabama Power is allowed to establish a regulatory asset to record the unrecovered investment costs, including the unrecovered plant asset balance and the unrecovered costs associated with site removal and closure associated with future unit retirements caused by environmental regulations. The regulatory asset is being amortized and recovered over the affected unit's remaining useful life, as established prior to the decision regarding early retirement through Rate CNP Compliance.On April 15, 2019, Alabama Power retired Plant Gorgas Units 8, 9, and 10 and reclassified approximately $654 million of the unrecovered asset balances to regulatory assets, which are being recovered over the units' remaining useful lives, the latest being through 2037, as established prior to the decision to retire. At December 31, 2019, the related regulatory assets totaled $649 million. Additionally, approximately $700 million of net capitalized asset retirement costs were reclassified to a regulatory asset in accordance with accounting guidance provided by the Alabama PSC. The asset retirement costs are being recovered through 2055. See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Alabama Power"" and Note 6 to the financial statements for additional information.Georgia PowerGeorgia Power's revenues from regulated retail operations are collected through various rate mechanisms subject to the oversight of the Georgia PSC. Georgia Power currently recovers its costs from the regulated retail business through an alternate rate plan, which includes traditional base tariffs, Demand-Side Management (DSM) tariffs, the ECCR tariff, and Municipal Franchise Fee (MFF) tariffs. In addition, financing costs on certified construction costs of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 are being collected through the NCCR tariff and fuel costs are collected through a separate fuel cost recovery tariff. See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Georgia Power – Rate Plans,"" "" – Fuel Cost Recovery,"" and "" – Nuclear Construction"" for additional information.Rate Plans2019 ARPOn December 17, 2019, the Georgia PSC voted to approve the 2019 ARP, under which Georgia Power increased its rates on January 1, 2020 and will increase rates annually for 2021 and 2022 as detailed below based on compliance filings to be made at least 90 days prior to the effective date. Georgia Power will recover estimated increases through its existing tariffs as follows:Tariff202020212022 (in millions)Traditional base$—$120$192ECCR(a)31855184DSM1211MFF1249Total(b)$342$181$386(a)Effective January 1, 2020, CCR AROs will be recovered through the ECCR tariff. See ""Integrated Resource Plan"" herein for additional information on recovery of compliance costs for CCR AROs.(b)Totals may not add due to rounding.Further, under the 2019 ARP, Georgia Power's retail ROE is set at 10.50%, and earnings will be evaluated against a retail ROE range of 9.50% to 12.00%. The Georgia PSC also approved an increase in the retail equity ratio to 56% from 55%. Any retail earnings above 12.00% will be shared, with 40% being applied to reduce regulatory assets, 40% directly refunded to customers, and the remaining 20% retained by Georgia Power. There will be no recovery of any earnings shortfall below 9.50% on an actual basis. However, if at any time during the term of the 2019 ARP, Georgia Power projects that its retail earnings will be below 9.50% for any calendar year, it could petition the Georgia PSC for implementation of the Interim Cost Recovery (ICR) tariff to adjust Georgia Power's retail rates to achieve a 9.50% ROE. The Georgia PSC would have 90 days to rule on Georgia Power's request. The ICR tariff would expire at the earlier of January 1, 2023 or the end of the calendar year in which the ICR tariff becomes effective. In lieu of requesting implementation of an ICR tariff, or if the Georgia PSC chooses not to implement the ICR tariff, Georgia Power may file a full rate case.Additionally, under the 2019 ARP and pursuant to the sharing mechanism approved in the 2013 ARP whereby two-thirds of any earnings above the top of the allowed ROE range are shared with Georgia Power's customers, (i) Georgia Power used 50% (approximately $50 million) of the customer share of earnings above the band in 2018 to reduce regulatory assets and 50% II-68 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2019 Annual Report(approximately $50 million) will be refunded to customers in 2020 and (ii) Georgia Power will forgo its share of 2019 earnings in excess of the earnings band so that 50% (approximately $60 million) of all earnings over the 2019 band will be refunded to customers and 50% (approximately $60 million) were used to reduce regulatory assets.Except as provided above, Georgia Power will not file for a general base rate increase while the 2019 ARP is in effect. Georgia Power is required to file a general base rate case by July 1, 2022, in response to which the Georgia PSC would be expected to determine whether the 2019 ARP should be continued, modified, or discontinued.2013 ARPPursuant to the terms and conditions of a settlement agreement related to Southern Company's acquisition of Southern Company Gas approved by the Georgia PSC in 2016, the 2013 ARP continued in effect until December 31, 2019. Furthermore, through December 31, 2019, Georgia Power retained its merger savings, net of transition costs, as defined in the settlement agreement; through December 31, 2022, such net merger savings will be shared on a 60/40 basis with customers; thereafter, all merger savings will be retained by customers.There were no changes to Georgia Power's traditional base tariffs, ECCR tariff, DSM tariffs, or MFF tariffs in 2017, 2018, or 2019.Under the 2013 ARP, Georgia Power's retail ROE was set at 10.95% and earnings were evaluated against a retail ROE range of 10.00% to 12.00%. Two-thirds of any earnings above 12.00% were to be directly refunded to customers, with the remaining one-third retained by Georgia Power. On February 5, 2019, the Georgia PSC approved a settlement between Georgia Power and the staff of the Georgia PSC under which Georgia Power's retail ROE for 2017 was stipulated to exceed 12.00% and Georgia Power reduced certain regulatory assets by approximately $4 million in lieu of providing refunds to retail customers. In 2019 and 2018, Georgia Power's retail ROE exceeded 12.00% and, under the modified sharing mechanism pursuant to the 2019 ARP, Georgia Power has reduced regulatory assets by a total of approximately $110 million and expects to refund a total of approximately $110 million to customers, subject to review and approval by the Georgia PSC. See ""2019 ARP"" and ""Integrated Resource Plan"" herein for additional information.Tax Reform Settlement AgreementIn April 2018, the Georgia PSC approved the Georgia Power Tax Reform Settlement Agreement. To reflect the federal income tax rate reduction impact of the Tax Reform Legislation, Georgia Power issued bill credits of approximately $95 million and $130 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively, and is issuing bill credits of approximately $105 million in February 2020, for a total of $330 million. In addition, Georgia Power deferred as a regulatory liability (i) the revenue equivalent of the tax expense reduction resulting from legislation lowering the Georgia state income tax rate from 6.00% to 5.75% in 2019 and (ii) the entire benefit of federal and state excess accumulated deferred income taxes. At December 31, 2019, the related regulatory liability balance totaled $659 million, which is being amortized over a three-year period ending December 31, 2022 in accordance with the 2019 ARP.To address some of the negative cash flow and credit quality impacts of the Tax Reform Legislation, the Georgia PSC also approved an increase in Georgia Power's retail equity ratio to the lower of (i) Georgia Power's actual common equity weight in its capital structure or (ii) 55%, until the Georgia PSC approved the 2019 ARP. Benefits from reduced federal income tax rates in excess of the amounts refunded to customers were retained by Georgia Power to cover the carrying costs of the incremental equity in 2018 and 2019.See ""2019 ARP"" herein for additional information.Integrated Resource PlanSee ""Environmental Matters"" herein for additional information regarding proposed and final EPA rules and regulations, including revisions to ELG for steam electric power plants and additional regulations of CCR and CO2.On July 16, 2019, the Georgia PSC voted to approve Georgia Power's modified triennial IRP (Georgia Power 2019 IRP). In the Georgia Power 2019 IRP, the Georgia PSC approved the decertification and retirement of Plant Hammond Units 1 through 4 (840 MWs) and Plant McIntosh Unit 1 (142.5 MWs) effective July 29, 2019. In accordance with the 2019 ARP, the remaining net book values at December 31, 2019 of $488 million for the Plant Hammond units are being recovered over a period equal to the respective unit's remaining useful life, which varies between 2024 and 2035, and $30 million for Plant McIntosh Unit 1 is being recovered over a three-year period ending December 31, 2022. In addition, approximately $20 million of related unusable materials and supplies inventory balances and approximately $295 million of net capitalized asset retirement costs were reclassified to a regulatory asset. In accordance with the modifications to the earnings sharing mechanism approved in the 2019 ARP, Georgia Power fully amortized the regulatory assets associated with these unusable materials and supplies inventory II-69 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2019 Annual Reportbalances as well as a regulatory asset of approximately $50 million related to costs for a future generation site in Stewart County, Georgia. See ""Rate Plans – 2019 ARP"" herein for additional information.Also in the Georgia Power 2019 IRP, the Georgia PSC approved Georgia Power's proposed environmental compliance strategy associated with ash pond and certain landfill closures and post-closure care in compliance with the CCR Rule and the related state rule. In the 2019 ARP, the Georgia PSC approved recovery of the estimated under recovered balance of these compliance costs at December 31, 2019 over a three-year period ending December 31, 2022 and recovery of estimated compliance costs for 2020, 2021, and 2022 over three-year periods ending December 31, 2022, 2023, and 2024, respectively, with recovery of construction contingency beginning in the year following actual expenditure. The under recovered balance at December 31, 2019 was $175 million and the estimated compliance costs expected to be incurred in 2020, 2021, and 2022 are $265 million, $290 million, and $390 million, respectively. The ECCR tariff is expected to be revised for actual expenditures and updated estimates through future annual compliance filings. See ""Environmental Matters – Environmental Laws and Regulations – Coal Combustion Residuals"" and FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY – ""Capital Requirements"" and ""Contractual Obligations"" herein and Note 6 to the financial statements for additional information regarding Georgia Power's AROs.On February 4, 2020, the Georgia PSC voted to deny a motion for reconsideration filed by the Sierra Club regarding the Georgia PSC's decision in the 2019 ARP allowing Georgia Power to recover compliance costs for CCR AROs.Additionally, the Georgia PSC rejected a request to certify approximately 25 MWs of capacity at Plant Scherer Unit 3 for the retail jurisdiction beginning January 1, 2020 following the expiration of a wholesale PPA. Georgia Power may offer such capacity in the wholesale market or to the retail jurisdiction in a future IRP.The Georgia PSC also approved Georgia Power to (i) issue requests for proposals (RFP) for capacity beginning in 2022 or 2023 and in 2026, 2027, or 2028; (ii) procure up to an additional 2,210 MWs of renewable resources through competitive RFPs; and (iii) invest in a portfolio of up to 80 MWs of battery energy storage technologies.Fuel Cost RecoveryGeorgia Power has established fuel cost recovery rates approved by the Georgia PSC. Georgia Power is scheduled to file its next fuel case no later than March 16, 2020, with new rates, if any, to be effective June 1, 2020. Georgia Power continues to be allowed to adjust its fuel cost recovery rates under an interim fuel rider prior to the next fuel case if the under or over recovered fuel balance exceeds $200 million. At December 31, 2019, Georgia Power's over recovered fuel balance was $73 million.Georgia Power's fuel cost recovery mechanism includes costs associated with a natural gas hedging program, as revised and approved by the Georgia PSC, allowing the use of an array of derivative instruments within a 48-month time horizon.Fuel cost recovery revenues as recorded on the financial statements are adjusted for differences in actual recoverable fuel costs and amounts billed in current regulated rates. Accordingly, changes in the billing factor will not have a significant effect on Southern Company's or Georgia Power's revenues or net income but will affect operating cash flows.Storm Damage RecoveryBeginning January 1, 2020, Georgia Power is recovering $213 million annually through December 31, 2022, as provided in the 2019 ARP, for incremental operations and maintenance costs of damage from major storms to its transmission and distribution facilities. At December 31, 2019, the balance in the regulatory asset related to storm damage was $410 million. The rate of storm damage cost recovery is expected to be adjusted in future regulatory proceedings as necessary. As a result of this regulatory treatment, costs related to storms are not expected to have a material impact on Southern Company's or Georgia Power's financial statements. See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Georgia Power – Storm Damage Recovery"" for additional information regarding Georgia Power's storm damage reserve.Mississippi PowerMississippi Power's rates and charges for service to retail customers are subject to the regulatory oversight of the Mississippi PSC. Mississippi Power's rates are a combination of base rates and several separate cost recovery clauses for specific categories of costs. These separate cost recovery clauses address such items as fuel and purchased power, energy efficiency programs, ad valorem taxes, property damage, and the costs of compliance with environmental laws and regulations. Costs not addressed through one of the specific cost recovery clauses are expected to be recovered through Mississippi Power's base rates. See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Mississippi Power"" for additional information.II-70 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2019 Annual Report2019 Base Rate CaseOn November 26, 2019, Mississippi Power filed the Mississippi Power 2019 Base Rate Case with the Mississippi PSC. The filing includes a requested annual decrease in Mississippi Power's retail rates of $5.8 million, or 0.6%, which is driven primarily by changes in the amortization rates of certain regulatory assets and liabilities and cost reductions, partially offset by an increase in Mississippi Power's requested return on investment and depreciation associated with the filing of an updated depreciation study. The revenue requirements included in the filing are based on a projected test year period of January 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020, a 53% average equity ratio, and a 7.728% return on investment. The filing reflects the elimination of separate rates for costs associated with the Kemper County energy facility and energy efficiency initiatives; those costs are proposed to be included in the PEP, ECO Plan, and ad valorem tax adjustment factor, as applicable. On December 10, 2019, the Mississippi PSC suspended the base rate case filing through no later than March 25, 2020. If no further action is taken by the Mississippi PSC, the proposed rates may be effective beginning on March 26, 2020. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.Operations ReviewIn August 2018, the Mississippi PSC began an operations review of Mississippi Power, for which the final report is expected prior to the conclusion of the Mississippi Power 2019 Base Rate Case. The review includes, but is not limited to, a comparative analysis of its costs, its cost recovery framework, and ways in which it may streamline management operations for the reasonable benefit of ratepayers. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.Reserve Margin PlanOn December 31, 2019, Mississippi Power updated its proposed RMP, originally filed in August 2018, as required by the Mississippi PSC. In 2018, Mississippi Power had proposed alternatives to reduce its reserve margin and lower or avoid operating costs, with the most economic alternatives being the two-year and seven-year acceleration of the retirement of Plant Watson Units 4 and 5, respectively, to the first quarter 2022 and the four-year acceleration of the retirement of Plant Greene County Units 1 and 2 to the third quarter 2021 and the third quarter 2022, respectively. The December 2019 update noted that Plant Daniel Units 1 and 2 currently have long-term economics similar to Plant Watson Unit 5. The Plant Greene County unit retirements would require the completion by Alabama Power of proposed transmission and system reliability improvements, as well as agreement by Alabama Power. The RMP filing also states that, in the event the Mississippi PSC ultimately approves an alternative that includes an accelerated retirement, Mississippi Power would require authorization to defer in a regulatory asset for future recovery the remaining net book value of the units at the time of retirement. A decision by the Mississippi PSC that does not include recovery of the remaining book value of any generating units retired could have a material impact on Southern Company's and Mississippi Power's financial statements. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time. See Note 3 to the financial statements under ""Other Matters – Mississippi Power"" for additional information on Plant Daniel Units 1 and 2.Performance Evaluation PlanMississippi Power's retail base rates generally are set under the PEP, a rate plan approved by the Mississippi PSC. In recognition that Mississippi Power's long-term financial success is dependent upon how well it satisfies its customers' needs, PEP includes performance indicators that directly tie customer service indicators to Mississippi Power's allowed ROE. PEP measures Mississippi Power's performance on a 10-point scale as a weighted average of results in three areas: average customer price, as compared to prices of other regional utilities (weighted at 40%); service reliability, measured in percentage of time customers had electric service (40%); and customer satisfaction, measured in a survey of residential customers (20%). Typically, two PEP filings are made for each calendar year: the PEP projected filing, which is typically filed prior to the beginning of the year based on a projected revenue requirement, and the PEP lookback filing, which is filed after the end of the year and allows for review of the actual revenue requirement compared to the projected filing.In February 2018, Mississippi Power revised its annual projected PEP filing for 2018 to reflect the impacts of the Tax Reform Legislation. The revised filing requested an increase of $26 million in annual revenues, based on a performance adjusted ROE of 9.33% and an increased equity ratio of 55%. In July 2018, Mississippi Power and the MPUS entered into a settlement agreement, which was approved by the Mississippi PSC in August 2018 (PEP Settlement Agreement). Rates under the PEP Settlement Agreement became effective with the first billing cycle of September 2018. The PEP Settlement Agreement provided for an increase of approximately $21.6 million in annual base retail revenues, which excluded certain compensation costs contested by the MPUS, as well as approximately $2 million subsequently approved for recovery through the 2018 Energy Efficiency Cost Rider. Under the PEP Settlement Agreement, Mississippi Power deferred a portion of the contested compensation costs for 2018 and 2019 as a regulatory asset, which totaled $4 million as of December 31, 2019 and is included in other regulatory assets, II-71 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2019 Annual Reportdeferred on the balance sheet. The Mississippi PSC is expected to rule on the appropriate treatment for such costs in connection with the Mississippi Power 2019 Base Rate Case. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time. Pursuant to the PEP Settlement Agreement, Mississippi Power's performance-adjusted allowed ROE is 9.31% and its allowed equity ratio is capped at 51%, pending further review by the Mississippi PSC. In lieu of the requested equity ratio increase, Mississippi Power retained $44 million of excess accumulated deferred income taxes resulting from the Tax Reform Legislation until the conclusion of the Mississippi Power 2019 Base Rate Case. Further, Mississippi Power agreed to seek equity contributions sufficient to restore its equity ratio to 50% by December 31, 2018. Since Mississippi Power's actual average equity ratio for 2018 was more than 1% lower than the 50% target, Mississippi Power deferred the corresponding difference in its revenue requirement of approximately $4 million as a regulatory liability for resolution in the Mississippi Power 2019 Base Rate Case. Pursuant to the PEP Settlement Agreement, PEP proceedings are suspended until after the conclusion of the Mississippi Power 2019 Base Rate Case and Mississippi Power was not required to make any PEP filings for regulatory years 2018, 2019, and 2020. Energy EfficiencyOn February 5, 2019, the Mississippi PSC issued an order approving Mississippi Power's Energy Efficiency Cost Rider 2019 compliance filing, which included a slight decrease in annual retail revenues, effective with the first billing cycle in March 2019.As part of the Mississippi Power 2019 Base Rate Case, Mississippi Power has proposed that the Energy Efficiency Cost Rider be eliminated and those costs be included in the PEP. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.Environmental Compliance Overview PlanIn accordance with a 2011 accounting order from the Mississippi PSC, Mississippi Power has the authority to defer in a regulatory asset for future recovery all plant retirement- or partial retirement-related costs resulting from environmental regulations. The Mississippi PSC approved $41 million and $17 million of costs that were reclassified to regulatory assets associated with the fuel conversion of Plant Watson and Plant Greene County, respectively, for amortization over five-year periods ending in July 2021 and July 2022, respectively.In August 2018, the Mississippi PSC approved an annual increase in revenues related to the ECO Plan of approximately $17 million, effective with the first billing cycle for September 2018. This increase represented the maximum 2% annual increase in revenues and primarily related to the carryforward from the prior year.The increase was the result of Mississippi PSC approval of an agreement between Mississippi Power and the MPUS to settle the 2018 ECO Plan filing (ECO Settlement Agreement) and was sufficient to recover costs through 2019, including remaining amounts deferred from prior years along with the related carrying costs. In accordance with the ECO Settlement Agreement, ECO Plan proceedings are suspended until after the conclusion of the Mississippi Power 2019 Base Rate Case and Mississippi Power was not required to make any ECO Plan filings for 2018, 2019, and 2020, with any necessary adjustments reflected in the Mississippi Power 2019 Base Rate Case. The ECO Settlement Agreement contains the same terms as the PEP Settlement Agreement described herein with respect to allowed ROE and equity ratio. At December 31, 2019, Mississippi Power has recorded $2 million in other regulatory liabilities, deferred on the balance sheet related to the actual December 31, 2018 average equity ratio differential from target applicable to the ECO Plan.On October 24, 2019, the Mississippi PSC approved Mississippi Power's July 9, 2019 request for a CPCN to complete certain environmental compliance projects, primarily associated with the Plant Daniel coal units co-owned 50% with Gulf Power. The total estimated cost is approximately $125 million, with Mississippi Power's share of approximately $66 million being proposed for recovery through its ECO Plan. Approximately $17 million of Mississippi Power's share is associated with ash pond closure and is reflected in Mississippi Power's ARO liabilities. See Note 6 to the financial statements for additional information on AROs and Note 3 to the financial statements under ""Other Matters – Mississippi Power"" for additional information on Gulf Power's ownership in Plant Daniel.Fuel Cost RecoveryMississippi Power annually establishes and is required to file for an adjustment to the retail fuel cost recovery factor that is approved by the Mississippi PSC. The Mississippi PSC approved decreases of $35 million and $24 million, effective in February 2019 and 2020, respectively. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, over recovered retail fuel costs included in other current liabilities on Southern Company's balance sheets and over recovered regulatory clause liabilities on Mississippi Power's balance sheets were approximately $23 million and $8 million, respectively.II-72 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2019 Annual ReportMississippi Power has wholesale MRA and Market Based (MB) fuel cost recovery factors. Effective with the first billing cycle for January 2019, the wholesale MRA fuel rate increased $16 million annually and the wholesale MB fuel rate decreased by an immaterial amount. Effective January 1, 2020, the wholesale MRA fuel rate increased $1 million annually and the wholesale MB fuel rate decreased by an immaterial amount. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, over recovered wholesale MRA fuel costs included in other current liabilities on Southern Company's balance sheets and over recovered regulatory clause liabilities on Mississippi Power's balance sheets were approximately $6 million. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, over/under recovered wholesale MB fuel costs included in the balance sheets were immaterial.Mississippi Power's operating revenues are adjusted for differences in actual recoverable fuel cost and amounts billed in accordance with the currently approved cost recovery rate. Accordingly, changes in the billing factor should have no significant effect on Mississippi Power's revenues or net income but will affect operating cash flows.Kemper County Energy FacilityOverviewThe Kemper County energy facility was designed to utilize IGCC technology with an expected output capacity of 582 MWs and to be fueled by locally mined lignite (an abundant, lower heating value coal) from a mine owned by Mississippi Power and situated adjacent to the Kemper County energy facility.Schedule and Cost EstimateIn 2012, the Mississippi PSC issued an order confirming the CPCN originally approved by the Mississippi PSC in 2010 authorizing the acquisition, construction, and operation of the Kemper County energy facility. The order approved a construction cost cap of up to $2.88 billion, with recovery of prudently-incurred costs subject to approval by the Mississippi PSC. The Kemper County energy facility was originally projected to be placed in service in May 2014. Mississippi Power placed the combined cycle and the associated common facilities portion of the Kemper County energy facility in service in August 2014. The combined cycle and associated common facilities portions of the Kemper County energy facility were dedicated as Plant Ratcliffe in April 2018.In June 2017, the Mississippi PSC stated its intent to issue an order, which occurred in July 2017, directing Mississippi Power to pursue a settlement under which the Kemper County energy facility would be operated as a natural gas plant, rather than an IGCC plant, and address all issues associated with the Kemper County energy facility. The order established a new docket for the purpose of pursuing a global settlement of the related costs (Kemper Settlement Docket). In June 2017, Mississippi Power notified the Mississippi PSC that it would begin a process to suspend operations and start-up activities on the gasifier portion of the Kemper County energy facility, given the uncertainty as to its future.At the time of project suspension in June 2017, the total cost estimate for the Kemper County energy facility was approximately $7.38 billion, including approximately $5.95 billion of costs subject to the construction cost cap, net of $137 million in additional grants from the DOE received in April 2016. In the aggregate, Mississippi Power had recorded charges to income of $3.07 billion ($1.89 billion after tax) as a result of changes in the cost estimate above the cost cap for the Kemper IGCC through May 2017.Given the Mississippi PSC's stated intent regarding no further rate increase for the Kemper County energy facility and the subsequent suspension, cost recovery of the gasifier portions became no longer probable; therefore, Mississippi Power recorded an additional charge to income in June 2017 of $2.8 billion ($2.0 billion after tax), which included estimated costs associated with the gasification portions of the plant and lignite mine. During the third and fourth quarters of 2017, Mississippi Power recorded charges to income of $242 million ($206 million after tax), including $164 million for ongoing project costs, estimated mine and gasifier-related costs, and certain termination costs during the suspension period prior to conclusion of the Kemper Settlement Docket, as well as the charge associated with the Kemper Settlement Agreement discussed below.In 2019, Mississippi Power recorded pre-tax and after-tax charges to income of $24 million, primarily associated with the expected close out of a related DOE contract, as well as other abandonment and related closure costs and ongoing period costs, net of salvage proceeds, for the mine and gasifier-related assets. The after-tax amount for 2019 includes an adjustment related to the tax abandonment of the Kemper IGCC following the filing of the 2018 tax return. In 2018, Mississippi Power recorded pre-tax charges to income of $37 million ($68 million benefit after tax), primarily associated with abandonment and related closure costs and ongoing period costs, net of salvage proceeds, for the mine and gasifier-related assets, as well as the impact of a change in the valuation allowance for the related state income tax NOL carryforward.Mississippi Power expects to substantially complete mine reclamation activities in 2020 and dismantlement of the abandoned gasifier-related assets and site restoration activities are expected to be completed in 2024. The additional pre-tax period costs associated with dismantlement and site restoration activities, including related costs for compliance and safety, ARO accretion, II-73 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2019 Annual Reportand property taxes, are estimated to total $17 million in 2020, $15 million to $16 million annually in 2021 through 2023, and $5 million in 2024.See Note 10 to the financial statements for additional information.Rate RecoveryIn February 2018, the Mississippi PSC voted to approve a settlement agreement related to cost recovery for the Kemper County energy facility among Mississippi Power, the MPUS, and certain intervenors (Kemper Settlement Agreement), which resolved all cost recovery issues, modified the CPCN to limit the Kemper County energy facility to natural gas combined cycle operation, and provided for an annual revenue requirement of approximately $99.3 million for costs related to the Kemper County energy facility, which included the impact of the Tax Reform Legislation. The revenue requirement was based on (i) a fixed ROE for 2018 of 8.6% excluding any performance adjustment, (ii) a ROE for 2019 calculated in accordance with PEP, excluding the performance adjustment, (iii) for future years, a performance-based ROE calculated pursuant to PEP, and (iv) amortization periods for the related regulatory assets and liabilities of eight years and six years, respectively. The revenue requirement also reflects a disallowance related to a portion of Mississippi Power's investment in the Kemper County energy facility requested for inclusion in rate base, which was recorded in the fourth quarter 2017 as an additional charge to income of approximately $78 million ($85 million net of accumulated depreciation of $7 million) pre-tax ($48 million after tax).Under the Kemper Settlement Agreement, retail customer rates were reduced by approximately $26.8 million annually, effective with the first billing cycle of April 2018, and include no recovery for costs associated with the gasifier portion of the Kemper County energy facility in 2018 or at any future date.On November 26, 2019, Mississippi Power filed the Mississippi Power 2019 Base Rate Case, which reflects the elimination of separate rates for costs associated with the Kemper County energy facility; these costs are proposed to be included in rates for PEP, ECO Plan, and ad valorem tax adjustment factor, as applicable. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.Lignite Mine and CO2 Pipeline FacilitiesMississippi Power owns the lignite mine and equipment and mineral reserves located around the Kemper County energy facility site. The mine started commercial operation in June 2013. In connection with the Kemper County energy facility construction, Mississippi Power also constructed a pipeline for the transport of captured CO2.In 2010, Mississippi Power executed a management fee contract with Liberty Fuels Company, LLC (Liberty Fuels), a wholly-owned subsidiary of The North American Coal Corporation, which developed, constructed, and is responsible for the mining operations through the end of the mine reclamation. As the mining permit holder, Liberty Fuels has a legal obligation to perform mine reclamation and Mississippi Power has a contractual obligation to fund all reclamation activities. As a result of the abandonment of the Kemper IGCC, final mine reclamation began in 2018 and is expected to be substantially completed in 2020, with monitoring expected to continue through 2027. See Note 6 to the financial statements for additional information.On December 31, 2019, Mississippi Power transferred ownership of the CO2 pipeline to an unrelated gas pipeline company, with no resulting impact on income. In conjunction with the transfer of the CO2 pipeline, the parties agreed to enter into a 15-year firm transportation agreement, which is expected to be signed by March 2020, providing for the conversion by the pipeline company of the CO2 pipeline to a natural gas pipeline to be used for the delivery of natural gas to Plant Ratcliffe. The agreement will be treated as a finance lease for accounting purposes upon commencement, which is expected to occur by August 2020. See Note 9 to the financial statements for additional information.Government GrantsIn 2010, the DOE, through a cooperative agreement with SCS, agreed to fund $270 million of the Kemper County energy facility through the grants awarded to the project by the DOE under the Clean Coal Power Initiative Round 2. In 2016, additional DOE grants in the amount of $137 million were awarded to the Kemper County energy facility. Through December 31, 2018, Mississippi Power received total DOE grants of $387 million, of which $382 million reduced the construction costs of the Kemper County energy facility and $5 million reimbursed Mississippi Power for expenses associated with DOE reporting. In December 2018, Mississippi Power filed with the DOE its request for property closeout certification under the contract related to the $387 million of grants received. Mississippi Power expects to close out the DOE contract related to the Kemper County energy facility in 2020. In connection with the DOE closeout discussions, on April 29, 2019, the Civil Division of the Department of Justice informed Southern Company and Mississippi Power of an investigation related to the Kemper County energy facility. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time; however, it could have a material impact on Southern Company's and Mississippi Power's financial statements.II-74 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2019 Annual ReportMunicipal and Rural Associations TariffMississippi Power provides wholesale electric service to Cooperative Energy, East Mississippi Electric Power Association, and the City of Collins, all located in southeastern Mississippi, under a long-term, cost-based, FERC-regulated MRA tariff.In 2017, Mississippi Power and Cooperative Energy executed, and the FERC accepted, a Shared Service Agreement (SSA), as part of the MRA tariff, under which Mississippi Power and Cooperative Energy will share in providing electricity to the Cooperative Energy delivery points under the tariff, effective January 1, 2018. The SSA may be cancelled by Cooperative Energy with 10 years notice after December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2019, Cooperative Energy has the option to decrease its use of Mississippi Power's generation services under the MRA tariff up to 2.5% annually, with required notice, up to a maximum total reduction of 11%, or approximately $9 million in cumulative annual base revenues.On May 7, 2019, the FERC accepted Mississippi Power's requested $3.7 million annual decrease in MRA base rates effective January 1, 2019, as agreed upon in the MRA Settlement Agreement, resolving all matters related to the Kemper County energy facility, similar to the retail rate settlement agreement approved by the Mississippi PSC in February 2018, and reflecting the impacts of the Tax Reform Legislation.Cooperative Energy Power Supply AgreementEffective April 1, 2018, Mississippi Power and Cooperative Energy amended and extended a previous power supply agreement through March 31, 2021, which was subsequently extended through May 31, 2021. The amendment increased the total capacity from 86 MWs to 286 MWs.Cooperative Energy also has a 10-year network integration transmission service agreement (NITSA) with SCS for transmission service to certain delivery points on Mississippi Power's transmission system through March 31, 2021. As a result of the PSA amendment, Cooperative Energy and SCS also amended the terms of the NITSA, which the FERC approved, to provide for the purchase of incremental transmission capacity from April 1, 2018 through March 31, 2021.Southern Company GasUtility Regulation and Rate DesignThe natural gas distribution utilities are subject to regulations and oversight by their respective state regulatory agencies. Rates charged to customers vary according to customer class (residential, commercial, or industrial) and rate jurisdiction. These agencies approve rates designed to provide the opportunity to generate revenues to recover all prudently-incurred costs, including a return on rate base sufficient to pay interest on debt and provide a reasonable ROE. Rate base generally consists of the original cost of the utility plant in service, working capital, and certain other assets, less accumulated depreciation on the utility plant in service and net deferred income tax liabilities, and may include certain other additions or deductions.The natural gas market for Atlanta Gas Light was deregulated in 1997. Accordingly, Marketers, rather than a traditional utility, sell natural gas to end-use customers in Georgia and handle customer billing functions. The Marketers file their rates monthly with the Georgia PSC. As a result of operating in a deregulated environment, Atlanta Gas Light's role includes:•distributing natural gas for Marketers;•constructing, operating, and maintaining the gas system infrastructure, including responding to customer service calls and leaks;•reading meters and maintaining underlying customer premise information for Marketers; and•planning and contracting for capacity on interstate transportation and storage systems.Atlanta Gas Light earns revenue by charging rates to its customers based primarily on monthly fixed charges that are set by the Georgia PSC and adjusted periodically. The Marketers add these fixed charges when billing customers. This mechanism, called a straight-fixed-variable rate design, minimizes the seasonality of Atlanta Gas Light's revenues since the monthly fixed charge is not volumetric or directly weather dependent. See ""GRAM"" and ""PRP"" herein for additional information.With the exception of Atlanta Gas Light, the earnings of the natural gas distribution utilities can be affected by customer consumption patterns that are largely a function of weather conditions and price levels for natural gas. Specifically, customer demand substantially increases during the Heating Season when natural gas is used for heating purposes. Southern Company Gas has various mechanisms, such as weather and revenue normalization mechanisms and weather derivative instruments, that limit exposure to weather changes within typical ranges in these utilities' respective service territories.With the exception of Atlanta Gas Light, the natural gas distribution utilities are authorized by the relevant regulatory agencies in the states in which they serve to use natural gas cost recovery mechanisms that adjust rates to reflect changes in the wholesale II-75 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2019 Annual Reportcost of natural gas and ensure recovery of all costs prudently incurred in purchasing natural gas for customers. Natural gas cost recovery revenues are adjusted for differences in actual recoverable natural gas costs and amounts billed in current regulated rates. Changes in the billing factor will not have a significant effect on Southern Company Gas' revenues or net income, but will affect cash flows. Since Atlanta Gas Light does not sell natural gas directly to its end-use customers, it does not utilize a traditional natural gas cost recovery mechanism. However, Atlanta Gas Light does maintain natural gas inventory for the Marketers in Georgia and recovers the cost through recovery mechanisms approved by the Georgia PSC specific to Georgia's deregulated market. In addition to natural gas recovery mechanisms, there are other cost recovery mechanisms, such as regulatory riders, which vary by utility but allow recovery of certain costs, such as those related to infrastructure replacement programs as well as environmental remediation and energy efficiency plans. In traditional rate designs, utilities recover a significant portion of the fixed customer service and pipeline infrastructure costs based on assumed natural gas volumes used by customers. The utilities, including Nicor Gas beginning in November 2019, have decoupled regulatory mechanisms that Southern Company Gas believes encourage conservation by separating the recoverable amount of these fixed costs from the amounts of natural gas used by customers. See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Southern Company Gas – Rate Proceedings"" for additional information. Also see ""Construction Programs – Southern Company Gas – Infrastructure Replacement Programs and Capital Projects"" for additional information regarding infrastructure replacement programs at certain of the natural gas distribution utilities.The following table provides regulatory information for Southern Company Gas' natural gas distribution utilities: Nicor Gas Atlanta Gas Light Virginia Natural Gas Chattanooga GasAuthorized ROE(a)9.73% 10.25% 9.50% 9.80%Authorized ROE range(a)N/A 10.05% - 10.45% 9.00% - 10.00% N/AWeather normalization mechanisms(b) ü üDecoupled, including straight-fixed-variable rates(c)ü ü ü Regulatory infrastructure program rates(d)ü ü Bad debt rider(e)ü ü üEnergy efficiency plan(f)ü ü Annual base rate adjustment mechanism(g) ü üYear of last rate decision2019 2019 2018 2018(a)Atlanta Gas Light's authorized ROE and ROE range became effective on January 1, 2020.

Various infrastructure programs previously authorized by the Georgia PSC, including the Integrated Vintage Plastic Replacement Program (i-VPR) to replace aging plastic pipe and the Integrated System Reinforcement Program (i-SRP) to upgrade Atlanta Gas Light's distribution system and LNG facilities in Georgia, continue under GRAM and the recovery of and return on the infrastructure program investments are included in annual base rate adjustments. The future expected costs to be recovered through rates related to allowed, but not incurred, costs are recognized in an unrecognized ratemaking amount that is not reflected on the balance sheets. This allowed cost is primarily the equity return on the capital investment under the infrastructure programs in place prior to GRAM. See ""Unrecognized Ratemaking Amounts"" herein for additional information. The Georgia PSC reviews Atlanta Gas Light's performance annually under GRAM. See ""Rate Proceedings"" herein for additional information.II-76 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2019 Annual ReportPursuant to the GRAM approval, Atlanta Gas Light and the staff of the Georgia PSC agreed to a variation of the Integrated Customer Growth Program to extend pipeline facilities to serve customers in areas without pipeline access and create new economic development opportunities in Georgia. As a result, a new tariff was created, effective October 10, 2017, to provide up to $15 million annually for Atlanta Gas Light to commit to strategic economic development projects. Projects under this tariff must be approved by the Georgia PSC.PRPAtlanta Gas Light previously recovered PRP costs through a PRP surcharge established in 2015 to address recovery of the under recovered PRP balance and the related carrying costs. Effective January 2018, PRP costs are being recovered through GRAM and base rates until the earlier of the full recovery of the under recovered amount or December 31, 2025. The under recovered balance at December 31, 2019 was $135 million, including $70 million of unrecognized equity return. See ""Rate Proceedings"" and ""Unrecognized Ratemaking Amounts"" herein for additional information.Rate ProceedingsNicor GasIn January 2018, the Illinois Commission approved a $137 million increase in annual base rate revenues, including $93 million related to the recovery of investments under the Investing in Illinois program, effective in February 2018, based on a ROE of 9.8%. In May 2018, the Illinois Commission approved Nicor Gas' rehearing request for revised base rates to incorporate the reduction in the federal income tax rate as a result of the Tax Reform Legislation. The resulting decrease of approximately $44 million in annual base rate revenues became effective May 5, 2018. The benefits of the Tax Reform Legislation from January 25, 2018 through May 4, 2018 were refunded to customers via bill credits and concluded in the second quarter 2019.In November 2018, Nicor Gas filed a general base rate case with the Illinois Commission. On October 2, 2019, the Illinois Commission approved a $168 million annual base rate increase effective October 8, 2019. The base rate increase included $65 million related to the recovery of program costs under the Investing in Illinois program and was based on a ROE of 9.73% and an equity ratio of 54.2%. Additionally, the Illinois Commission approved a volume balancing adjustment, a revenue decoupling mechanism for residential customers that provides a monthly benchmark level of revenue per rate class for recovery.Atlanta Gas LightOn June 3, 2019, Atlanta Gas Light filed a general base rate case with the Georgia PSC. On December 19, 2019, the Georgia PSC approved a $65 million annual base rate increase, effective January 1, 2020, based on a ROE of 10.25% and an equity ratio of 56%. Earnings will be evaluated against a ROE range of 10.05% to 10.45%, with disposition of any earnings above 10.45% to be determined by the Georgia PSC. Additionally, the Georgia PSC approved continuation of the previously authorized inclusion in base rates of the recovery of and return on the infrastructure program investments, including, but not limited to, GRAM adjustments, and a reauthorization and continuation of GRAM until terminated by the Georgia PSC. GRAM filing rate adjustments will be based on the authorized ROE of 10.25%. GRAM adjustments for 2021 may not exceed 5% of 2020 base rates. The 5% limitation does not set a precedent in any future rate proceedings by Atlanta Gas Light.On January 31, 2020, in accordance with the Georgia PSC's order for the 2019 rate case, Atlanta Gas Light filed a recommended notice of proposed rulemaking for a long-range planning tool. The proposal provides for participating natural gas utilities to file a comprehensive capacity supply and related infrastructure delivery plan for a 10-year period, including capital and related operations and maintenance expense budgets. Participating natural gas utilities would file an updated 10-year plan at least once every third year under the proposal. Related costs of implementing an approved comprehensive plan would be included in the utility's next rate case or GRAM filing. The rulemaking process is expected to be completed during 2020.Virginia Natural GasIn December 2018, the Virginia Commission approved Virginia Natural Gas' annual information form filing, which reduced annual base rates by $14 million effective January 1, 2019 due to lower tax expense as a result of the Tax Reform Legislation, along with customer refunds, via bill credits, for $14 million related to 2018 tax benefits deferred as a regulatory liability at December 31, 2018. These customer refunds were completed in the first quarter 2019.On February 3, 2020, Virginia Natural Gas filed a notice of intent with the Virginia Commission as required prior to the filing of a base rate case, which will occur between April 3, 2020 and April 30, 2020. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Southern Company Gas – Rate Proceedings"" for additional information.II-77 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2019 Annual ReportAffiliate Asset Management AgreementsWith the exception of Nicor Gas, the natural gas distribution utilities use asset management agreements with an affiliate, Sequent, for the primary purpose of reducing utility customers' gas cost recovery rates through payments to the utilities by Sequent. For Atlanta Gas Light, these payments are controlled by the Georgia PSC and are utilized for infrastructure improvements and to fund heating assistance programs, rather than as a reduction to gas cost recovery rates. Under these asset management agreements, Sequent supplies natural gas to the utility and markets available pipeline and storage capacity to improve the overall cost of supplying gas to the utility customers. Currently, the natural gas distribution utilities primarily purchase their gas from Sequent. The purchase agreements require Sequent to provide firm gas to the natural gas distribution utilities, but these natural gas distribution utilities maintain the right and ability to make their own long-term supply arrangements if they believe it is in the best interest of their customers.Each agreement provides for Sequent to make payments to the natural gas distribution utility through either an annual minimum guarantee within a profit sharing structure, a profit sharing structure without an annual minimum guarantee, or a fixed fee.Unrecognized Ratemaking AmountsThe following table illustrates Southern Company Gas' authorized ratemaking amounts that are not recognized on its balance sheets. These amounts are primarily composed of an allowed equity rate of return on assets associated with certain regulatory infrastructure programs. These amounts will be recognized as revenues in Southern Company Gas' financial statements in the periods they are billable to customers, the majority of which will be recovered by 2025.

The Southern Company system intends to continue its strategy of developing and constructing new electric generating facilities, expanding and improving the electric transmission and electric and natural gas distribution systems, and undertaking projects to comply with environmental laws and regulations.For the traditional electric operating companies, major generation construction projects are subject to state PSC approval in order to be included in retail rates. The largest construction project currently underway in the Southern Company system is Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. See ""Nuclear Construction"" herein for additional information. Also see ""Regulatory Matters – Alabama Power"" herein for information regarding Alabama Power's construction of Plant Barry Unit 8.While Southern Power generally constructs and acquires generation assets covered by long-term PPAs, any uncontracted capacity could negatively affect future earnings. See ""Southern Power"" herein, ""Acquisitions and Dispositions – Southern Power"" herein, and Note 15 to the financial statements under ""Southern Power"" for additional information about costs relating to Southern Power's acquisitions that involve construction of renewable energy facilities.Southern Company Gas is engaged in various infrastructure improvement programs designed to update or expand the natural gas distribution systems of the natural gas distribution utilities to improve reliability and meet operational flexibility and growth. The natural gas distribution utilities recover their investment and a return associated with these infrastructure programs through their regulated rates. See ""Southern Company Gas"" herein for additional information regarding infrastructure improvement programs at the natural gas distribution utilities and certain pipeline construction projects.See FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY – ""Capital Requirements"" herein for additional information regarding the Registrants' capital requirements for their construction programs, including estimated totals for each of the next five years.Nuclear ConstructionIn 2009, the Georgia PSC certified construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Georgia Power holds a 45.7% ownership interest in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. In 2012, the NRC issued the related combined construction and operating licenses, which allowed full construction of the two AP1000 nuclear units (with electric generating capacity of approximately 1,100 MWs each) and related facilities to begin. Until March 2017, construction on Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 continued under the Vogtle 3 and 4 Agreement, II-78 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2019 Annual Reportwhich was a substantially fixed price agreement. In March 2017, the EPC Contractor filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.In connection with the EPC Contractor's bankruptcy filing, Georgia Power, acting for itself and as agent for the other Vogtle Owners, entered into several transitional arrangements to allow construction to continue. In July 2017, Georgia Power, acting for itself and as agent for the other Vogtle Owners, entered into the Vogtle Services Agreement, whereby Westinghouse provides facility design and engineering services, procurement and technical support, and staff augmentation on a time and materials cost basis. The Vogtle Services Agreement provides that it will continue until the start-up and testing of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 are complete and electricity is generated and sold from both units. The Vogtle Services Agreement is terminable by the Vogtle Owners upon 30 days' written notice.In October 2017, Georgia Power, acting for itself and as agent for the other Vogtle Owners, executed the Bechtel Agreement, a cost reimbursable plus fee arrangement, whereby Bechtel is reimbursed for actual costs plus a base fee and an at-risk fee, which is subject to adjustment based on Bechtel's performance against cost and schedule targets. Each Vogtle Owner is severally (not jointly) liable for its proportionate share, based on its ownership interest, of all amounts owed to Bechtel under the Bechtel Agreement. The Vogtle Owners may terminate the Bechtel Agreement at any time for their convenience, provided that the Vogtle Owners will be required to pay amounts related to work performed prior to the termination (including the applicable portion of the base fee), certain termination-related costs, and, at certain stages of the work, the applicable portion of the at-risk fee. Bechtel may terminate the Bechtel Agreement under certain circumstances, including certain Vogtle Owner suspensions of work, certain breaches of the Bechtel Agreement by the Vogtle Owners, Vogtle Owner insolvency, and certain other events.See Note 8 to the financial statements under ""Long-term Debt – DOE Loan Guarantee Borrowings"" for information on the Amended and Restated Loan Guarantee Agreement, including applicable covenants, events of default, mandatory prepayment events, and conditions to borrowing.Cost and ScheduleGeorgia Power's approximate proportionate share of the remaining estimated capital cost to complete Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 by the expected in-service dates of November 2021 and November 2022, respectively, is as follows: (in billions)Base project capital cost forecast(a)(b)$8.2Construction contingency estimate0.2Total project capital cost forecast(a)(b)8.4Net investment as of December 31, 2019(b)(5.9)Remaining estimate to complete(a)$2.5(a)Excludes financing costs expected to be capitalized through AFUDC of approximately $300 million, of which $23 million had been accrued through December 31, 2019.(b)Net of $1.7 billion received from Toshiba under the Guarantee Settlement Agreement and approximately $188 million in related customer refunds.As of December 31, 2019, approximately $140 million of the $366 million construction contingency estimate established in the second quarter 2018 was allocated to the base capital cost forecast for cost risks including, among other factors, construction productivity; craft labor incentives; adding resources for supervision, field support, project management, initial test program, start-up, and operations and engineering support; subcontracts; and procurement. As and when construction contingency is spent, Georgia Power may request the Georgia PSC to evaluate those expenditures for rate recovery.Georgia Power estimates that its financing costs for construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 will total approximately $3.1 billion, of which $2.2 billion had been incurred through December 31, 2019.As part of its ongoing processes, Southern Nuclear continues to evaluate cost and schedule forecasts on a regular basis to incorporate current information available, particularly in the areas of commodity installation, system turnovers, and workforce statistics.In April 2019, Southern Nuclear established aggressive target values for monthly construction production and system turnover activities as part of a strategy to maintain and, where possible, build margin to the regulatory-approved in-service dates of November 2021 for Unit 3 and November 2022 for Unit 4. The project has faced challenges with the April 2019 aggressive strategy targets, including, but not limited to, electrical and pipefitting labor productivity and closure rates for work packages, which resulted in a backlog of activities and completion percentages below the April 2019 aggressive strategy targets. However, II-79 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2019 Annual ReportSouthern Nuclear and Georgia Power believe that existing productivity levels and pace of activity completion are sufficient to meet the regulatory-approved in-service dates.In February 2020, Southern Nuclear updated its cost and schedule forecast, which did not change the projected overall capital cost forecast and confirmed the expected in-service dates of November 2021 for Unit 3 and November 2022 for Unit 4. This update included initiatives to improve productivity while refining and extending system turnover plans and certain near-term milestone dates. Other milestone dates did not change. Achievement of the aggressive site work plan relies on meeting increased monthly production and activity target values during 2020. To meet these 2020 targets, existing craft, including subcontractors, construction productivity must improve and be sustained above historical average levels, appropriate levels of craft laborers, particularly electrical and pipefitter craft labor, must be maintained, and additional supervision and other field support resources must be retained. Southern Nuclear and Georgia Power continue to believe that pursuit of an aggressive site work plan is an appropriate strategy to achieve completion of the units by their regulatory-approved in-service dates.As construction, including subcontract work, continues and testing and system turnover activities increase, challenges with management of contractors and vendors; subcontractor performance; supervision of craft labor and related craft labor productivity, particularly in the installation of electrical and mechanical commodities, ability to attract and retain craft labor, and/or related cost escalation; procurement, fabrication, delivery, assembly, installation, system turnover, and the initial testing and start-up, including any required engineering changes or any remediation related thereto, of plant systems, structures, or components (some of which are based on new technology that only within the last few years began initial operation in the global nuclear industry at this scale), or regional transmission upgrades, any of which may require additional labor and/or materials; or other issues could arise and change the projected schedule and estimated cost.There have been technical and procedural challenges to the construction and licensing of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 at the federal and state level and additional challenges may arise. Processes are in place that are designed to assure compliance with the requirements specified in the Westinghouse Design Control Document and the combined construction and operating licenses, including inspections by Southern Nuclear and the NRC that occur throughout construction. As a result of such compliance processes, certain license amendment requests have been filed and approved or are pending before the NRC. Various design and other licensing-based compliance matters, including the timely submittal by Southern Nuclear of the ITAAC documentation for each unit and the related reviews and approvals by the NRC necessary to support NRC authorization to load fuel, may arise, which may result in additional license amendments or require other resolution. As part of the aggressive site work plan, in January 2020, Southern Nuclear notified the NRC of its intent to load fuel in 2020. If any license amendment requests or other licensing-based compliance issues are not resolved in a timely manner, there may be delays in the project schedule that could result in increased costs.The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time. However, any extension of the regulatory-approved project schedule is currently estimated to result in additional base capital costs of approximately $50 million per month, based on Georgia Power's ownership interests, and AFUDC of approximately $12 million per month. While Georgia Power is not precluded from seeking recovery of any future capital cost forecast increase, management will ultimately determine whether or not to seek recovery. Any further changes to the capital cost forecast that are not expected to be recoverable through regulated rates will be required to be charged to income and such charges could be material.Joint Owner ContractsIn November 2017, the Vogtle Owners entered into an amendment to their joint ownership agreements for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 to provide for, among other conditions, additional Vogtle Owner approval requirements. Effective in August 2018, the Vogtle Owners further amended the joint ownership agreements to clarify and provide procedures for certain provisions of the joint ownership agreements related to adverse events that require the vote of the holders of at least 90% of the ownership interests in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 to continue construction (as amended, and together with the November 2017 amendment, the Vogtle Joint Ownership Agreements). The Vogtle Joint Ownership Agreements also confirm that the Vogtle Owners' sole recourse against Georgia Power or Southern Nuclear for any action or inaction in connection with their performance as agent for the Vogtle Owners is limited to removal of Georgia Power and/or Southern Nuclear as agent, except in cases of willful misconduct.As a result of an increase in the total project capital cost forecast and Georgia Power's decision not to seek rate recovery of the increase in the base capital costs in conjunction with the nineteenth VCM report in 2018, the holders of at least 90% of the ownership interests in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 were required to vote to continue construction. In September 2018, the Vogtle Owners unanimously voted to continue construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4.II-80 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2019 Annual ReportAmendments to the Vogtle Joint Ownership AgreementsIn connection with the vote to continue construction, Georgia Power entered into (i) a binding term sheet (Vogtle Owner Term Sheet) with the other Vogtle Owners and MEAG Power's wholly-owned subsidiaries MEAG Power SPVJ, LLC (MEAG SPVJ), MEAG Power SPVM, LLC (MEAG SPVM), and MEAG Power SPVP, LLC (MEAG SPVP) to take certain actions which partially mitigate potential financial exposure for the other Vogtle Owners, including additional amendments to the Vogtle Joint Ownership Agreements and the purchase of PTCs from the other Vogtle Owners at pre-established prices, and (ii) a term sheet (MEAG Term Sheet) with MEAG Power and MEAG SPVJ to provide funding with respect to MEAG SPVJ's ownership interest in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 under certain circumstances. On January 14, 2019, Georgia Power, MEAG Power, and MEAG SPVJ entered into an agreement to implement the provisions of the MEAG Term Sheet. On February 18, 2019, Georgia Power, the other Vogtle Owners, and MEAG Power's wholly-owned subsidiaries MEAG SPVJ, MEAG SPVM, and MEAG SPVP entered into certain amendments to the Vogtle Joint Ownership Agreements to implement the provisions of the Vogtle Owner Term Sheet.The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.Regulatory MattersIn 2009, the Georgia PSC voted to certify construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 with a certified capital cost of $4.418 billion. In addition, in 2009 the Georgia PSC approved inclusion of the Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 related CWIP accounts in rate base, and the State of Georgia enacted the Georgia Nuclear Energy Financing Act, which allows Georgia Power to recover financing costs for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Financing costs are recovered on all applicable certified costs through annual adjustments to the NCCR tariff up to the certified capital cost of $4.418 billion. At December 31, 2019, Georgia Power had recovered approximately $2.2 billion of financing costs. Financing costs related to capital costs above $4.418 billion are being recognized through AFUDC and are expected to be recovered through retail rates over the life of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4; however, Georgia Power will not record AFUDC related to any capital costs in excess of the total deemed reasonable by the Georgia PSC (currently $7.3 billion) and not requested for rate recovery. On December 17, 2019, the Georgia PSC approved Georgia Power's request to decrease the NCCR tariff by $62 million annually, effective January 1, 2020.Georgia Power is required to file semi-annual VCM reports with the Georgia PSC by February 28 and August 31 of each year. In 2013, in connection with the eighth VCM report, the Georgia PSC approved a stipulation between Georgia Power and the staff of the Georgia PSC to waive the requirement to amend the Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 certificate in accordance with the 2009 certification order until the completion of Plant Vogtle Unit 3, or earlier if deemed appropriate by the Georgia PSC and Georgia Power.In 2016, the Georgia PSC voted to approve a settlement agreement (Vogtle Cost Settlement Agreement) resolving certain prudency matters in connection with the fifteenth VCM report. In December 2017, the Georgia PSC voted to approve (and issued its related order on January 11, 2018) Georgia Power's seventeenth VCM report and modified the Vogtle Cost Settlement Agreement. The Vogtle Cost Settlement Agreement, as modified by the January 11, 2018 order, resolved the following regulatory matters related to Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4: (i) none of the $3.3 billion of costs incurred through December 31, 2015 and reflected in the fourteenth VCM report should be disallowed from rate base on the basis of imprudence; (ii) the Contractor Settlement Agreement was reasonable and prudent and none of the amounts paid pursuant to the Contractor Settlement Agreement should be disallowed from rate base on the basis of imprudence; (iii) (a) capital costs incurred up to $5.68 billion would be presumed to be reasonable and prudent with the burden of proof on any party challenging such costs, (b) Georgia Power would have the burden to show that any capital costs above $5.68 billion were prudent, and (c) a revised capital cost forecast of $7.3 billion (after reflecting the impact of payments received under the Guarantee Settlement Agreement and related customer refunds) was found reasonable; (iv) construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 should be completed, with Southern Nuclear serving as project manager and Bechtel as primary contractor; (v) approved and deemed reasonable Georgia Power's revised schedule placing Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 in service in November 2021 and November 2022, respectively; (vi) confirmed that the revised cost forecast does not represent a cost cap and that prudence decisions on cost recovery will be made at a later date, consistent with applicable Georgia law; (vii) reduced the ROE used to calculate the NCCR tariff (a) from 10.95% (the ROE rate setting point authorized by the Georgia PSC in the 2013 ARP) to 10.00% effective January 1, 2016, (b) from 10.00% to 8.30%, effective January 1, 2020, and (c) from 8.30% to 5.30%, effective January 1, 2021 (provided that the ROE in no case will be less than Georgia Power's average cost of long-term debt); (viii) reduced the ROE used for AFUDC equity for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 from 10.00% to Georgia Power's average cost of long-term debt, effective January 1, 2018; and (ix) agreed that upon Unit 3 reaching commercial operation, retail base rates would be adjusted to include carrying costs on those capital costs deemed prudent in the Vogtle Cost Settlement Agreement. The January 11, 2018 order also stated that if Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 are not commercially operational by June 1, 2021 and June 1, 2022, respectively, the ROE used to calculate the NCCR tariff will be further reduced by 10 basis points each month (but not lower than Georgia Power's average cost of long-term debt) until the respective Unit is commercially operational. The ROE reductions negatively impacted earnings by approximately $75 million, II-81 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2019 Annual Report$100 million, and $25 million in 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively, and are estimated to have negative earnings impacts of approximately $140 million, $240 million, and $190 million in 2020, 2021, and 2022, respectively. In its January 11, 2018 order, the Georgia PSC also stated if other conditions change and assumptions upon which Georgia Power's seventeenth VCM report are based do not materialize, the Georgia PSC reserved the right to reconsider the decision to continue construction.In February 2018, Georgia Interfaith Power & Light, Inc. (GIPL) and Partnership for Southern Equity, Inc. (PSE) filed a petition appealing the Georgia PSC's January 11, 2018 order with the Fulton County Superior Court. In March 2018, Georgia Watch filed a similar appeal to the Fulton County Superior Court for judicial review of the Georgia PSC's decision and denial of Georgia Watch's motion for reconsideration. In December 2018, the Fulton County Superior Court granted Georgia Power's motion to dismiss the two appeals. On January 9, 2019, GIPL, PSE, and Georgia Watch filed an appeal of this decision with the Georgia Court of Appeals. On October 29, 2019, the Georgia Court of Appeals issued an opinion affirming the Fulton County Superior Court's ruling that the Georgia PSC's January 11, 2018 order was not a final, appealable decision. In addition, the Georgia Court of Appeals remanded the case to the Fulton County Superior Court to clarify its ruling as to whether the petitioners showed that review of the Georgia PSC's final order would not provide them an adequate remedy. Georgia Power believes the petitions have no merit; however, an adverse outcome in the litigation combined with subsequent adverse action by the Georgia PSC could have a material impact on Southern Company's and Georgia Power's results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.On February 18, 2020, the Georgia PSC approved Georgia Power's twentieth VCM report and its concurrently-filed twenty-first VCM report, including approval of (i) $1.2 billion of construction capital costs incurred from July 1, 2018 through June 30, 2019 and (ii) $21.5 million of expenditures related to Georgia Power's portion of an administrative claim filed in the Westinghouse bankruptcy proceedings (which expenditures had previously been deferred by the Georgia PSC for later approval). Through the twenty-first VCM, the Georgia PSC has approved total construction capital costs incurred through June 30, 2019 of $6.7 billion (before $1.7 billion of payments received under the Guarantee Settlement Agreement and approximately $188 million in related customer refunds). On February 19, 2020, Georgia Power filed its twenty-second VCM report with the Georgia PSC covering the period from July 1, 2019 through December 31, 2019, requesting approval of $674 million of construction capital costs incurred during that period.The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.Southern PowerDuring 2019, Southern Power completed construction of and placed in service the 385-MW Plant Mankato expansion and the Wildhorse Mountain facility, acquired and continued construction of the Skookumchuck facility, and continued construction of the Reading facility.Project FacilityResourceApproximate Nameplate Capacity (MW)LocationActual/ExpectedCODPPA CounterpartiesPPA Contract PeriodProjects Completed During the Year Ended December 31, 2019Mankato expansion(a)Natural Gas385Mankato, MNMay 2019Northern States Power Company20 yearsWildhorse Mountain (b)Wind100Pushmataha County, OKDecember 2019Arkansas Electric Cooperative Corporation20 yearsProjects Under Construction at December 31, 2019Reading(c)Wind200Osage and Lyon Counties, KSSecond quarter 2020Royal Caribbean Cruises LTD12 yearsSkookumchuck(d)Wind136Lewis and Thurston Counties, WASecond quarter 2020Puget Sound Energy20 years(a)Southern Power completed the sale of its equity interests in Plant Mankato, including the expansion, to a subsidiary of Xcel on January 17, 2020.

The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.II-82 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2019 Annual Report(d)In October 2019, Southern Power purchased 100% of the membership interests of the Skookumchuck facility pursuant to a joint development arrangement. In December 2019, Southern Power entered into a tax equity agreement as the Class B member with funding of the tax equity amounts expected to occur upon commercial operation. Shortly after commercial operation, Southern Power may sell a noncontrolling interest in these Class B membership interests to another partner. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.Total aggregate construction costs for the two projects under construction at December 31, 2019, excluding acquisition costs, are expected to be between $490 million and $535 million. At December 31, 2019, total costs of construction incurred for these projects were $417 million and are included in CWIP. The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.Southern Company GasInfrastructure Replacement Programs and Capital ProjectsSouthern Company Gas continues to focus on capital discipline and cost control while pursuing projects and initiatives that are expected to have current and future benefits to customers, provide an appropriate return on invested capital, and help ensure the safety and reliability of the utility infrastructure. In addition to capital expenditures recovered through base rates by each of the natural gas distribution utilities, Nicor Gas and Virginia Natural Gas have separate rate riders that provide timely recovery of capital expenditures for specific infrastructure replacement programs. Total capital expenditures incurred during 2019 for gas distribution operations were $1.4 billion.The following table and discussions provide updates on the infrastructure replacement programs and capital projects at the natural gas distribution utilities at December 31, 2019. These programs are risk-based and designed to update and replace cast iron, bare steel, and mid-vintage plastic materials or expand Southern Company Gas' distribution systems to improve reliability and meet operational flexibility and growth. The anticipated expenditures for these programs in 2020 are quantified in the discussion below.

Scope of program miles is an estimate and subject to change. Nicor GasIn 2013, Illinois enacted legislation that allows Nicor Gas to provide more widespread safety and reliability enhancements to its distribution system. The legislation stipulates that rate increases to customers as a result of any infrastructure investments shall not exceed a cumulative annual average of 4.0% or, in any given year, 5.5% of base rate revenues. In 2014, the Illinois Commission approved the nine-year regulatory infrastructure program, Investing in Illinois, subject to annual review. Nicor Gas expects to place into service $400 million of qualifying projects under Investing in Illinois in 2020.In conjunction with the base rate case order issued by the Illinois Commission in January 2018, Nicor Gas is recovering program costs incurred prior to December 31, 2017 through base rates. Additionally, the Illinois Commission's approval of Nicor Gas' rate case on October 2, 2019 included $65 million in annual revenues related to the recovery of program costs from January 1, 2018 through September 30, 2019 under the Investing in Illinois program. See ""Regulatory Matters – Southern Company Gas – Rate Proceedings"" herein for additional information.Virginia Natural GasIn 2012, the Virginia Commission approved the SAVE program, an accelerated infrastructure replacement program. In 2016 and on September 25, 2019, the Virginia Commission approved amendments and extensions to the SAVE program. The latest extension allows Virginia Natural Gas to continue replacing aging pipeline infrastructure through 2024 and increases its authorized investment under the previously-approved plan from $35 million to $40 million in 2019 with additional annual investments of $50 million in 2020, $60 million in 2021, $70 million in each year from 2022 through 2024, and a total potential II-83 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2019 Annual Reportvariance of up to $5 million allowed for the program, for a maximum total investment over the six-year term (2019 through 2024) of $365 million. Virginia Natural Gas expects to invest $50 million under this program in 2020.The SAVE program is subject to annual review by the Virginia Commission. In accordance with the base rate case order issued by the Virginia Commission in 2017, Virginia Natural Gas is recovering program costs incurred prior to September 1, 2017 through base rates. Program costs incurred subsequent to September 1, 2017 are currently recovered through a separate rider and are subject to future base rate case proceedings.On December 6, 2019, Virginia Natural Gas filed an application with the Virginia Commission for a 24.1-mile header improvement project to improve resiliency and increase the supply of natural gas delivered to energy suppliers, including Virginia Natural Gas. The cost of the project is expected to total $346 million. The Virginia Commission is expected to rule on this application in the second quarter 2020. Construction is expected to begin in June 2021 and the project is expected to be placed in service in the fourth quarter 2022. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.Atlanta Gas LightAs discussed under ""Regulatory Matters – Southern Company Gas – Utility Regulation and Rate Design"" herein, i-SRP and i-VPR will continue under GRAM and the recovery of and return on current and future infrastructure program capital investments will be included in base rates.Pipeline Construction ProjectsSouthern Company Gas is involved in two significant pipeline construction projects within its gas pipeline investments segment. These projects, along with Southern Company Gas' existing pipelines, are intended to provide diverse sources of natural gas supplies to customers, resolve current and long-term supply planning for new capacity, enhance system reliability, and generate economic development in the areas served.In 2014, Southern Company Gas entered into a joint venture, whereby it holds a 5% ownership interest in the Atlantic Coast Pipeline, an interstate pipeline company formed to develop and operate an approximate 605-mile natural gas pipeline in North Carolina, Virginia, and West Virginia with expected initial transportation capacity of 1.5 Bcf per day. The proposed pipeline project is expected to transport natural gas to customers in Virginia. In 2017, the Atlantic Coast Pipeline received FERC approval.The Atlantic Coast Pipeline has experienced challenges to its permits since construction began in 2018. During the third and fourth quarters 2018, a FERC stop work order, together with delays in obtaining permits necessary for construction and construction delays due to judicial actions, impacted the cost and schedule for the project. Project cost estimates are approximately $8.0 billion ($400 million for Southern Company Gas), excluding financing costs. On October 4, 2019, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear Atlantic Coast Pipeline's appeal of a lower court ruling that overturned a key permit for the project. On January 7, 2020, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit vacated another key permit. The operator of the joint venture has indicated that it currently expects to complete construction by the end of 2021 and place the project in service shortly thereafter.On February 7, 2020, Southern Company Gas entered into an agreement with Dominion Atlantic Coast Pipeline, LLC for the sale of its interest in Atlantic Coast Pipeline. The transaction is expected to be completed in the first half of 2020; however, the ultimate outcome cannot be determined at this time. See Note 15 to the financial statements under ""Southern Company Gas – Proposed Sale of Pivotal LNG and Atlantic Coast Pipeline"" for additional information.Also in 2014, Southern Company Gas entered into a partnership in which it holds a 20% ownership interest in the PennEast Pipeline, an interstate pipeline company formed to develop and operate an approximate 118-mile natural gas pipeline between New Jersey and Pennsylvania. The expected initial transportation capacity of 1.0 Bcf per day is under long-term contracts, mainly with public utilities and other market-serving entities, such as electric generation companies, in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and New York. Southern Company Gas believes this pipeline will alleviate takeaway constraints in the Marcellus region and help mitigate some of the price volatility experienced during recent winters.Expected project costs related to the PennEast Pipeline for Southern Company Gas total approximately $300 million, excluding financing costs. In January 2018, the PennEast Pipeline received initial FERC approval. Work continues with state and federal agencies to obtain the required permits to begin construction. On September 10, 2019, an appellate court ruled that the PennEast Pipeline does not have federal eminent domain authority over lands in which a state has property rights interests. On February 18, 2020, PennEast Pipeline filed a petition for a writ of certiorari to seek U.S. Supreme Court review of the appellate court decision. On December 30, 2019, PennEast Pipeline filed a two-year extension request with the FERC to complete the project by January 19, 2022.II-84 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2019 Annual ReportAdditionally, on January 30, 2020, PennEast Pipeline filed an amendment with the FERC to construct the pipeline project in two phases. The first phase would consist of 68 miles of pipe, constructed entirely within Pennsylvania, which is expected to be completed by November 2021. The second phase would include the remaining route in Pennsylvania and New Jersey and is targeted for completion in 2023. FERC approval of the amended plan is required prior to beginning the first phase.The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time; however, any work delays, whether caused by judicial or regulatory action, abnormal weather, or other conditions, may result in additional cost or schedule modifications or, ultimately, in project cancellation, any of which could result in an impairment of one or both of Southern Company Gas' investments and could have a material impact on Southern Company's and Southern Company Gas' financial statements. Southern Company Gas evaluated its investments and determined there was no impairment as of December 31, 2019.See Notes 3 and 7 to the financial statements under ""Guarantees"" and ""Southern Company Gas – Equity Method Investments,"" respectively, for additional information on these pipeline projects.Southern Power's Power Sales AgreementsGeneralSouthern Power has PPAs with some of the traditional electric operating companies, other investor-owned utilities, IPPs, municipalities, and other load-serving entities, as well as commercial and industrial customers. The PPAs are expected to provide Southern Power with a stable source of revenue during their respective terms.Many of Southern Power's PPAs have provisions that require Southern Power or the counterparty to post collateral or an acceptable substitute guarantee in the event that S&P or Moody's downgrades the credit ratings of the respective company to an unacceptable credit rating or if the counterparty is not rated or fails to maintain a minimum coverage ratio.On January 29, 2019, Pacific Gas & Electric Company (PG&E) filed petitions to reorganize under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Southern Power, together with its noncontrolling partners, owns four solar facilities where PG&E is the energy off-taker for approximately 207 MWs of capacity under long-term PPAs. PG&E is also the transmission provider for these four facilities and two of Southern Power's other solar facilities. At December 31, 2019, Southern Power had outstanding accounts receivables due from PG&E of $2 million related to the PPAs and $33 million related to the transmission interconnections (of which $27 million is classified in receivables – other and $6 million is classified in other deferred charges and assets). Subsequent to December 31, 2019, Southern Power received $15 million in accordance with a November 2019 bankruptcy court order granting payment of transmission interconnections for amounts due and owing. Southern Power continues to evaluate the recoverability of its investments in these solar facilities under various scenarios, including selling the related energy into the competitive markets, and has concluded that these solar facilities are not impaired. PG&E has continued to perform under the terms of the PPAs. Southern Power does not expect a material impact to its financial statements if, as a result of the bankruptcy proceedings, PG&E does not perform in accordance with the PPAs or the terms of the PPAs are renegotiated; however, the ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time. Southern Power is working to maintain and expand its share of the wholesale markets. During 2019, Southern Power saw an increase in the demand for energy and capacity that can be served from natural gas generating facilities, especially in the Southeast, and expects that this increase in demand will continue in the near term (2020-2022), with timing varying depending on the market. During 2019, Southern Power successfully remarketed approximately 190 to 650 MWs of annual natural gas generation capacity to load-serving entities through several PPAs extending over the next nine years. Southern Power calculates an investment coverage ratio for its generating assets, including those owned with various partners, based on the ratio of investment under contract to total investment using the respective generation facilities' net book value (or expected in-service value for facilities under construction) as the investment amount. With the inclusion of investments associated with the wind facilities currently under construction, as well as other capacity and energy contracts, and excluding Plant Mankato, which was sold on January 17, 2020, Southern Power's average investment coverage ratio at December 31, 2019 was 93% through 2024 and 90% through 2029, with an average remaining contract duration of approximately 14 years. See ""Acquisitions and Dispositions – Southern Power"" and ""Construction Programs – Southern Power"" herein for additional information.Natural GasSouthern Power's electricity sales from natural gas facilities are primarily through long-term PPAs that consist of two types of agreements. The first type, referred to as a unit or block sale, is a customer purchase from a dedicated generating unit where all or a portion of the generation from that unit is reserved for that customer. Southern Power typically has the ability to serve the unit or block sale customer from an alternate resource. The second type, referred to as requirements service, provides that Southern Power serve the customer's capacity and energy requirements from a combination of the customer's own generating units and II-85 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2019 Annual Reportfrom Southern Power resources not dedicated to serve unit or block sales. Southern Power has rights to purchase power provided by the requirements customers' resources when economically viable.As a general matter, substantially all of the PPAs provide that the purchasers are responsible for either procuring the fuel (tolling agreements) or reimbursing Southern Power for substantially all of the cost of fuel or purchased power relating to the energy delivered under such PPAs. To the extent a particular generating facility does not meet the operational requirements contemplated in the PPAs, Southern Power may be responsible for excess fuel costs. With respect to fuel transportation risk, most of Southern Power's PPAs provide that the counterparties are responsible for the availability of fuel transportation to the particular generating facility.Capacity charges that form part of the PPA payments are designed to recover fixed and variable operation and maintenance costs based on dollars-per-kilowatt year. In general, to reduce Southern Power's exposure to certain operation and maintenance costs, Southern Power has LTSAs. See Note 1 to the financial statements under ""Long-Term Service Agreements"" for additional information.Solar and WindSouthern Power's electricity sales from solar and wind (renewable) generating facilities are also primarily through long-term PPAs; however, these solar and wind PPAs do not have a capacity charge and customers either purchase the energy output of a dedicated renewable facility through an energy charge or provide Southern Power a certain fixed price for the electricity sold to the grid. As a result, Southern Power's ability to recover fixed and variable operations and maintenance expenses is dependent upon the level of energy generated from these facilities, which can be impacted by weather conditions, equipment performance, transmission constraints, and other factors. Generally, under the renewable generation PPAs, the purchasing party retains the right to keep or resell the renewable energy credits.Income Tax MattersConsolidated Income TaxesOn behalf of the Registrants, Southern Company files a consolidated federal income tax return and various state income tax returns, some of which are combined or unitary. Under a joint consolidated income tax allocation agreement, each Southern Company subsidiary's current and deferred tax expense is computed on a stand-alone basis and no subsidiary is allocated more current expense than would be paid if it filed a separate income tax return. In accordance with IRS regulations, each company is jointly and severally liable for the federal tax liability.The impact of certain tax events at Southern Company and/or its other subsidiaries can, and does, affect each Registrant's ability to utilize certain tax credits. See ""Tax Credits"" and ACCOUNTING POLICIES – ""Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates"" herein and Note 10 to the financial statements for additional information.Federal Tax Reform LegislationIn 2017, the Tax Reform Legislation was signed into law and became effective on January 1, 2018. The Tax Reform Legislation, among other things, reduced the federal corporate income tax rate to 21%, retained normalization provisions for public utility property and existing renewable energy incentives, and repealed the corporate alternative minimum tax. In addition, under the Tax Reform Legislation, NOLs generated after December 31, 2017 can no longer be carried back to previous tax years but can be carried forward indefinitely, with utilization limited to 80% of taxable income of the subsequent tax year. The projected reduction of Southern Company's consolidated income tax liability resulting from the tax rate reduction also delays the expected utilization of existing tax credit carryforwards. See ""Consolidated Income Taxes"" herein and Note 10 to the financial statements for information on Southern Company's joint consolidated income tax allocation agreement.II-86 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2019 Annual ReportBonus DepreciationUnder the Tax Reform Legislation, projects with binding contracts prior to September 28, 2017 and placed in service after September 27, 2017 remain eligible for 50% bonus depreciation for 2015 through 2017, 40% bonus depreciation for 2018, and 30% bonus depreciation for 2019 and certain long-lived assets placed in service in 2020. Based on provisional estimates, bonus depreciation is expected to result in positive cash flows for the Registrants as follows: 2019 Tax Year 2020 Tax Year (in millions)Southern Company$989 $382Alabama Power180 68Georgia Power314 56Mississippi Power7 2Southern Power(*)87 95Southern Company Gas190 58(*)Cash flows resulting from bonus depreciation for Southern Power would also be impacted by Southern Power's use of tax equity partnerships.See Note 10 to the financial statements under ""Current and Deferred Income Taxes"" for additional information. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.Tax CreditsThe Tax Reform Legislation retained solar energy incentives of 30% ITC for projects that commenced construction by December 31, 2019; 26% ITC for projects that commence construction in 2020; 22% ITC for projects that commence construction in 2021; and a permanent 10% ITC for projects that commence construction on or after January 1, 2022. In addition, the Tax Reform Legislation retained wind energy incentives of 100% PTC for projects that commenced construction in 2016; 80% PTC for projects that commenced construction in 2017; 60% PTC for projects that commenced construction in 2018; and 40% PTC for projects that commenced construction in 2019. As a result of a tax extenders bill passed in December 2019, projects that begin construction in 2020 will be entitled to 60% PTC. Projects commencing construction after 2020 will not be entitled to any PTCs. Southern Company has received ITCs and PTCs in connection with investments in solar, wind, and biomass facilities primarily at Southern Power and Georgia Power.Southern Power's ITCs relate to its investment in new solar facilities acquired or constructed and its PTCs relate to the first 10 years of energy production from its wind facilities, which have had, and may continue to have, a material impact on Southern Power's cash flows and net income. At December 31, 2019, Southern Company and Southern Power had approximately $1.8 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively, of unutilized ITCs and PTCs, which are currently expected to be fully utilized by 2024, but could be further delayed. Since 2018, Southern Power has been utilizing tax equity partnerships for wind and solar projects, where the tax partner takes significantly all of the respective federal tax benefits. These tax equity partnerships are consolidated in Southern Company's and Southern Power's financial statements using the HLBV methodology to allocate partnership gains and losses. See Note 1 to the financial statements under ""General"" for additional information on the HLBV methodology and Note 1 to the financial statements under ""Income Taxes"" and Note 10 to the financial statements under ""Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities – Tax Credit Carryforwards"" and ""Effective Tax Rate"" for additional information regarding utilization and amortization of credits and the tax benefit related to associated basis differences.General Litigation MattersThe Registrants are involved in various other matters being litigated and regulatory matters that could affect future earnings. The ultimate outcome of such pending or potential litigation or regulatory matters against each Registrant and any subsidiaries cannot be determined at this time; however, for current proceedings not specifically reported herein or in Notes 2 and 3 to the financial statements, management does not anticipate that the ultimate liabilities, if any, arising from such current proceedings would have a material effect on such Registrant's financial statements. See Notes 2 and 3 to the financial statements for a discussion of various other contingencies, regulatory matters, and other matters being litigated which may affect future earnings potential.The Registrants believe the pending legal challenges discussed below have no merit; however, the ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.II-87 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2019 Annual ReportSouthern CompanyIn January 2017, a securities class action complaint was filed against Southern Company, certain of its officers, and certain former Mississippi Power officers in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia by Monroe County Employees' Retirement System on behalf of all persons who purchased shares of Southern Company's common stock between April 25, 2012 and October 29, 2013. The complaint alleges that Southern Company, certain of its officers, and certain former Mississippi Power officers made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Kemper County energy facility in violation of certain provisions under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The complaint seeks, among other things, compensatory damages and litigation costs and attorneys' fees. In 2017, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint that provided additional detail about their claims, increased the purported class period by one day, and added certain other former Mississippi Power officers as defendants. Also in 2017, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the plaintiffs' amended complaint with prejudice, to which the plaintiffs filed an opposition. In March 2018, the court issued an order granting, in part, the defendants' motion to dismiss. The court dismissed certain claims against certain officers of Southern Company and Mississippi Power and dismissed the allegations related to a number of the statements that plaintiffs challenged as being false or misleading. In April 2018, the defendants filed a motion for reconsideration of the court's order, seeking dismissal of the remaining claims in the lawsuit. In August 2018, the court denied the motion for reconsideration and denied a motion to certify the issue for interlocutory appeal. On August 22, 2019, the court certified the plaintiffs' proposed class. On September 5, 2019, the defendants filed a petition for interlocutory appeal of the class certification order with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. On December 19, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia entered an order staying all deadlines in the case pending mediation. The stay automatically expires on March 31, 2020.In February 2017, Jean Vineyard and Judy Mesirov each filed a shareholder derivative lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia. Each of these lawsuits names as defendants Southern Company, certain of its directors, certain of its officers, and certain former Mississippi Power officers. In 2017, these two shareholder derivative lawsuits were consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia. The complaints allege that the defendants caused Southern Company to make false or misleading statements regarding the Kemper County energy facility cost and schedule. Further, the complaints allege that the defendants were unjustly enriched and caused the waste of corporate assets and also allege that the individual defendants violated their fiduciary duties. Each plaintiff seeks to recover, on behalf of Southern Company, unspecified actual damages and, on each plaintiff's own behalf, attorneys' fees and costs in bringing the lawsuit. Each plaintiff also seeks certain changes to Southern Company's corporate governance and internal processes. In April 2018, the court entered an order staying this lawsuit until 30 days after the resolution of any dispositive motions or any settlement, whichever is earlier, in the securities class action.In May 2017, Helen E. Piper Survivor's Trust filed a shareholder derivative lawsuit in the Superior Court of Gwinnett County, Georgia that names as defendants Southern Company, certain of its directors, certain of its officers, and certain former Mississippi Power officers. The complaint alleges that the individual defendants, among other things, breached their fiduciary duties in connection with schedule delays and cost overruns associated with the construction of the Kemper County energy facility. The complaint further alleges that the individual defendants authorized or failed to correct false and misleading statements regarding the Kemper County energy facility schedule and cost and failed to implement necessary internal controls to prevent harm to Southern Company. The plaintiff seeks to recover, on behalf of Southern Company, unspecified actual damages and disgorgement of profits and, on its behalf, attorneys' fees and costs in bringing the lawsuit. The plaintiff also seeks certain unspecified changes to Southern Company's corporate governance and internal processes. In May 2018, the court entered an order staying this lawsuit until 30 days after the resolution of any dispositive motions or any settlement, whichever is earlier, in the securities class action. On August 5, 2019, the court granted a motion filed by the plaintiff on July 17, 2019 to substitute a new named plaintiff, Martin J. Kobuck, in place of Helen E. Piper Survivor's Trust.Georgia PowerIn 2011, plaintiffs filed a putative class action against Georgia Power in the Superior Court of Fulton County, Georgia alleging that Georgia Power's collection in rates of amounts for municipal franchise fees (which fees are paid to municipalities) exceeded the amounts allowed in orders of the Georgia PSC and alleging certain state tort law claims. In 2016, the Georgia Court of Appeals reversed the trial court's previous dismissal of the case and remanded the case to the trial court. Georgia Power filed a petition for writ of certiorari with the Georgia Supreme Court, which was granted in 2017. In June 2018, the Georgia Supreme Court affirmed the judgment of the Georgia Court of Appeals and remanded the case to the trial court for further proceedings. Following a motion by Georgia Power, on February 13, 2019, the Superior Court of Fulton County ordered the parties to submit petitions to the Georgia PSC for a declaratory ruling to address certain terms the court previously held were ambiguous as used in the Georgia PSC's orders. The order entered by the Superior Court of Fulton County also conditionally certified the proposed class. In March 2019, Georgia Power and the plaintiffs filed petitions with the Georgia PSC seeking confirmation of the proper II-88 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2019 Annual Reportapplication of the municipal franchise fee schedule pursuant to the Georgia PSC's orders. On October 23, 2019, the Georgia PSC issued an order that found and concluded that Georgia Power has appropriately implemented the municipal franchise fee schedule. On March 6, 2019, Georgia Power filed a notice of appeal with the Georgia Court of Appeals regarding the Superior Court of Fulton County's February 2019 order. The amount of any possible losses cannot be calculated at this time because, among other factors, it is unknown whether conditional class certification will be upheld and the ultimate composition of any class and whether any losses would be subject to recovery from any municipalities.Mississippi PowerIn May 2018, Southern Company and Mississippi Power received a notice of dispute and arbitration demand filed by Martin Product Sales, LLC (Martin) based on two agreements, both related to Kemper IGCC byproducts for which Mississippi Power provided termination notices in 2017. Martin alleges breach of contract, breach of good faith and fair dealing, fraud and misrepresentation, and civil conspiracy and makes a claim for damages in the amount of approximately $143 million, as well as additional unspecified damages, attorney's fees, costs, and interest. A portion of the claim for damages was on behalf of Martin Transport, Inc. (Martin Transport), an affiliate of Martin. In the first quarter 2019, Mississippi Power and Southern Company filed motions to dismiss, which were denied by the arbitration panel on May 10, 2019. On September 27, 2019, Martin Transport filed a separate complaint against Mississippi Power in the Circuit Court of Kemper County, Mississippi alleging claims of fraud, negligent misrepresentation, promissory estoppel, and equitable estoppel, each arising out of the same alleged facts and circumstances that underlie Martin's arbitration demand. Martin Transport seeks compensatory damages of $5 million and punitive damages of $50 million. In November 2019, Martin Transport's claim was combined with the Martin arbitration case and the separate court case was dismissed. On December 16, 2019, Southern Company and Mississippi Power each filed motions for summary judgment on all claims. On February 17, 2020, the arbitration panel granted Southern Company's motion and dismissed Southern Company from the arbitration. An adverse outcome in this proceeding could have a material impact on Southern Company's and Mississippi Power's financial statements.In November 2018, Ray C. Turnage and 10 other individual plaintiffs filed a putative class action complaint against Mississippi Power and three members of the Mississippi PSC in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi. Mississippi Power received Mississippi PSC approval in 2013 to charge a mirror CWIP rate premised upon including in its rate base pre-construction and construction costs for the Kemper IGCC prior to placing the Kemper IGCC into service. The Mississippi Supreme Court reversed that approval and ordered Mississippi Power to refund the amounts paid by customers under the previously-approved mirror CWIP rate. The plaintiffs allege that the initial approval process, and the amount approved, were improper. They also allege that Mississippi Power underpaid customers by up to $23.5 million in the refund process by applying an incorrect interest rate. The plaintiffs seek to recover, on behalf of themselves and their putative class, actual damages, punitive damages, pre-judgment interest, post-judgment interest, attorney's fees, and costs. In response to Mississippi Power and the Mississippi PSC each filing a motion to dismiss, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on March 14, 2019. The amended complaint included four additional plaintiffs and additional claims for gross negligence, reckless conduct, and intentional wrongdoing. Mississippi Power and the Mississippi PSC have each filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint. An adverse outcome in this proceeding could have a material impact on Mississippi Power's financial statements.See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Kemper County Energy Facility"" for additional information.Other MattersSouthern CompanyA subsidiary of Southern Holdings has several leveraged lease agreements, with original terms ranging up to 45 years, which relate to international and domestic energy generation, distribution, and transportation assets. Southern Company receives federal income tax deductions for depreciation and amortization, as well as interest on long-term debt related to these investments. Southern Company reviews all important lease assumptions at least annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that a change in assumptions has occurred or may occur. These assumptions include the effective tax rate, the residual value, the credit quality of the lessees, and the timing of expected tax cash flows. See Note 1 to the financial statements under ""Leveraged Leases"" for additional information.The ability of the lessees to make required payments to the Southern Holdings subsidiary is dependent on the operational performance of the assets. In 2017, the financial and operational performance of one of the lessees and the associated generation assets raised significant concerns about the short-term ability of the generation assets to produce cash flows sufficient to support ongoing operations and the lessee's contractual obligations and its ability to make the remaining semi-annual lease payments through the end of the lease term in 2047. In addition, following the expiration of the existing power offtake agreement in 2032, the lessee also is exposed to remarketing risk, which encompasses the price and availability of alternative sources of generation. II-89 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2019 Annual ReportWhile all lease payments through December 31, 2019 have been paid in full due to recent operational improvements, operational and remarketing risks and the resulting cash liquidity challenges persist, and significant concerns continue regarding the lessee's ability to make the remaining semi-annual lease payments. These challenges may also impact the expected residual value of the generation assets. Southern Company has evaluated the recoverability of the lease receivable and the expected residual value of the generation assets under various scenarios. Based on current forecasts of energy prices in the years following the expiration of the existing PPA, Southern Company concluded that it is no longer probable that all of the associated rental payments will be received over the term of the lease. As a result, during the fourth quarter 2019, Southern Company revised the estimate of cash flows to be received under the leveraged lease, which resulted in an impairment charge of $17 million ($13 million after tax). If any future lease payment is not paid in full, the Southern Holdings subsidiary may be unable to make its corresponding payment to the holders of the underlying non-recourse debt related to the generation assets. Failure to make the required payment to the debtholders could represent an event of default that would give the debtholders the right to foreclose on, and take ownership of, the generation assets from the Southern Holdings subsidiary, in effect terminating the lease and resulting in the write-off of the related lease receivable, which totaled approximately $76 million at December 31, 2019. Southern Company will continue to monitor the operational performance of the underlying assets and evaluate the ability of the lessee to continue to make the required lease payments. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.Mississippi PowerIn conjunction with Southern Company's sale of Gulf Power, NextEra Energy held back $75 million of the purchase price pending Mississippi Power and Gulf Power negotiating a mutually acceptable revised operating agreement for Plant Daniel. In addition, Mississippi Power and Gulf Power committed to seek a restructuring of their 50% undivided ownership interests in Plant Daniel such that each of them would, after the restructuring, own 100% of a generating unit. On January 15, 2019, Gulf Power provided notice to Mississippi Power that Gulf Power will retire its share of the generating capacity of Plant Daniel on January 15, 2024. Mississippi Power has the option to purchase Gulf Power's ownership interest for $1 on January 15, 2024, provided that Mississippi Power exercises the option no later than 120 days prior to that date. Mississippi Power is assessing the potential operational and economic effects of Gulf Power's notice. The ultimate outcome of these matters remains subject to completion of Mississippi Power's evaluations and applicable regulatory approvals, including by the FERC and the Mississippi PSC, and cannot be determined at this time. See Note 15 to the financial statements under ""Southern Company"" for information regarding the sale of Gulf Power.Southern Company GasA wholly-owned subsidiary of Southern Company Gas owns and operates a natural gas storage facility consisting of two salt dome caverns in Louisiana. Periodic integrity tests are required in accordance with rules of the Louisiana Department of Natural Resources (DNR). In 2017, in connection with an ongoing integrity project, updated seismic mapping indicated the proximity of one of the caverns to the edge of the salt dome may be less than the required minimum and could result in Southern Company Gas retiring the cavern early.In the third quarter 2019, management determined that it no longer planned to obtain the core samples during 2020 that are necessary to determine the composition of the sheath surrounding the edge of the salt dome. Core sampling is a requirement of the Louisiana DNR to put the cavern back in service; as a result, the cavern will not return to service by 2021. This change in plan, which affects the future operation of the entire storage facility, resulted in a pre-tax impairment charge of $91 million ($69 million after-tax) recorded by Southern Company Gas in 2019. Southern Company Gas continues to monitor the pressure and overall structural integrity of the entire facility pending any future decisions regarding decommissioning.Southern Company Gas has two other natural gas storage facilities located in California and Texas, which could be impacted by ongoing changes in the U.S. natural gas storage market. Recent sales of natural gas storage facilities have resulted in losses for the sellers and may imply an impact on future rates and/or asset values. Sustained diminished natural gas storage values could trigger impairment of either or both of these natural gas storage facilities, which have a combined net book value of $326 million at December 31, 2019.The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time, but could have a material impact on the financial statements of Southern Company and Southern Company Gas.ACCOUNTING POLICIESApplication of Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesThe Registrants prepare their financial statements in accordance with GAAP. Significant accounting policies are described in the notes to the financial statements. In the application of these policies, certain estimates are made that may have a material impact II-90 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2019 Annual Reporton the results of operations and related disclosures of the applicable Registrants (as indicated in the section descriptions herein). Different assumptions and measurements could produce estimates that are significantly different from those recorded in the financial statements. Senior management has reviewed and discussed the following critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of Southern Company's Board of Directors.Utility Regulation (Southern Company, Alabama Power, Georgia Power, Mississippi Power, and Southern Company Gas)The traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities are subject to retail regulation by their respective state PSCs or other applicable state regulatory agencies and wholesale regulation by the FERC. These regulatory agencies set the rates the traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities are permitted to charge customers based on allowable costs, including a reasonable ROE. As a result, the traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities apply accounting standards which require the financial statements to reflect the effects of rate regulation. Through the ratemaking process, the regulators may require the inclusion of costs or revenues in periods different than when they would be recognized by a non-regulated company. This treatment may result in the deferral of expenses and the recording of related regulatory assets based on anticipated future recovery through rates or the deferral of gains or creation of liabilities and the recording of related regulatory liabilities. The application of the accounting standards for rate regulated entities also impacts their financial statements as a result of the estimates of allowable costs used in the ratemaking process. These estimates may differ from those actually incurred by the traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities; therefore, the accounting estimates inherent in specific costs such as depreciation, AROs, and pension and other postretirement benefits have less of a direct impact on the results of operations and financial condition of the applicable Registrants than they would on a non-regulated company.Revenues related to regulated utility operations as a percentage of total operating revenues in 2019 for the applicable Registrants were as follows: 87% for Southern Company, 99% for Alabama Power, 97% for Georgia Power, 100% for Mississippi Power, and 80% for Southern Company Gas.As reflected in Note 2 to the financial statements, significant regulatory assets and liabilities have been recorded. Management reviews the ultimate recoverability of these regulatory assets and any requirement to refund these regulatory liabilities based on applicable regulatory guidelines and GAAP. However, adverse legislative, judicial, or regulatory actions could materially impact the amounts of such regulatory assets and liabilities and could adversely impact the financial statements of the applicable Registrants.Estimated Cost, Schedule, and Rate Recovery for the Construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4(Southern Company and Georgia Power)In 2016, the Georgia PSC approved the Vogtle Cost Settlement Agreement, which resolved certain prudency matters in connection with Georgia Power's fifteenth VCM report. In 2017, the Georgia PSC approved Georgia Power's seventeenth VCM report, which included a recommendation to continue construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, with Southern Nuclear serving as project manager and Bechtel serving as the primary construction contractor, as well as a modification of the Vogtle Cost Settlement Agreement. The Georgia PSC's related order stated that under the modified Vogtle Cost Settlement Agreement, (i) none of the $3.3 billion of costs incurred through December 31, 2015 should be disallowed as imprudent; (ii) capital costs incurred up to $5.68 billion would be presumed to be reasonable and prudent with the burden of proof on any party challenging such costs; (iii) Georgia Power would have the burden of proof to show that any capital costs above $5.68 billion were prudent; (iv) Georgia Power's total project capital cost forecast of $7.3 billion (net of $1.7 billion received under the Guarantee Settlement Agreement and approximately $188 million in related customer refunds) was found reasonable and did not represent a cost cap; and (v) prudence decisions would be made subsequent to achieving fuel load for Unit 4.In its order, the Georgia PSC also stated if other conditions change and assumptions upon which Georgia Power's seventeenth VCM report are based do not materialize, the Georgia PSC reserved the right to reconsider the decision to continue construction.In the second quarter 2018, Georgia Power revised its base cost forecast and estimated contingency to complete construction and start-up of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 to $8.0 billion and $0.4 billion, respectively, for a total project capital cost forecast of $8.4 billion (net of $1.7 billion received under the Guarantee Settlement Agreement and approximately $188 million in related customer refunds). Although Georgia Power believes these incremental costs are reasonable and necessary to complete the project and the Georgia PSC's order in the seventeenth VCM proceeding specifically states that the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 is not subject to a cost cap, Georgia Power did not seek rate recovery for the $0.7 billion increase in costs included in the base capital cost forecast in the nineteenth VCM report. After considering the significant level of uncertainty that exists regarding the future recoverability of costs included in the construction contingency estimate since the ultimate outcome of these matters is subject to the outcome of future assessments by management, as well as Georgia PSC decisions in these future regulatory II-91 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2019 Annual Reportproceedings, Georgia Power recorded a total pre-tax charge to income of $1.1 billion ($0.8 billion after tax) in the second quarter 2018.Georgia Power's revised cost estimate reflects an expected in-service date of November 2021 for Unit 3 and November 2022 for Unit 4.As of December 31, 2019, approximately $140 million of the $366 million construction contingency estimate established in the second quarter 2018 was allocated to the base capital cost forecast for cost risks including, among other factors, construction productivity; craft labor incentives; adding resources for supervision, field support, project management, initial test program, start-up, and operations and engineering support; subcontracts; and procurement. As and when construction contingency is spent, Georgia Power may request the Georgia PSC to evaluate those expenditures for rate recovery.As part of its ongoing processes, Southern Nuclear continues to evaluate cost and schedule forecasts on a regular basis to incorporate current information available, particularly in the areas of commodity installation, system turnovers, and workforce statistics.In April 2019, Southern Nuclear established aggressive target values for monthly construction production and system turnover activities as part of a strategy to maintain and, where possible, build margin to the regulatory-approved in-service dates of November 2021 for Unit 3 and November 2022 for Unit 4. The project has faced challenges with the April 2019 aggressive strategy targets, including, but not limited to, electrical and pipefitting labor productivity and closure rates for work packages, which resulted in a backlog of activities and completion percentages below the April 2019 aggressive strategy targets. However, Southern Nuclear and Georgia Power believe that existing productivity levels and pace of activity completion are sufficient to meet the regulatory-approved in-service dates.In February 2020, Southern Nuclear updated its cost and schedule forecast, which did not change the projected overall capital cost forecast and confirmed the expected in-service dates of November 2021 for Unit 3 and November 2022 for Unit 4. This update included initiatives to improve productivity while refining and extending system turnover plans and certain near-term milestone dates. Other milestone dates did not change. Achievement of the aggressive site work plan relies on meeting increased monthly production and activity target values during 2020. To meet these 2020 targets, existing craft, including subcontractors, construction productivity must improve and be sustained above historical average levels, appropriate levels of craft laborers, particularly electrical and pipefitter craft labor, must be maintained, and additional supervision and other field support resources must be retained. Southern Nuclear and Georgia Power continue to believe that pursuit of an aggressive site work plan is an appropriate strategy to achieve completion of the units by their regulatory-approved in-service dates.As construction, including subcontract work, continues and testing and system turnover activities increase, challenges with management of contractors and vendors; subcontractor performance; supervision of craft labor and related craft labor productivity, particularly in the installation of electrical and mechanical commodities, ability to attract and retain craft labor, and/or related cost escalation; procurement, fabrication, delivery, assembly, installation, system turnover, and the initial testing and start-up, including any required engineering changes or any remediation related thereto, of plant systems, structures, or components (some of which are based on new technology that only within the last few years began initial operation in the global nuclear industry at this scale), or regional transmission upgrades, any of which may require additional labor and/or materials; or other issues could arise and change the projected schedule and estimated cost.There have been technical and procedural challenges to the construction and licensing of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 at the federal and state level and additional challenges may arise. Processes are in place that are designed to assure compliance with the requirements specified in the Westinghouse Design Control Document and the combined construction and operating licenses, including inspections by Southern Nuclear and the NRC that occur throughout construction. As a result of such compliance processes, certain license amendment requests have been filed and approved or are pending before the NRC. Various design and other licensing-based compliance matters, including the timely submittal by Southern Nuclear of the ITAAC documentation for each unit and the related reviews and approvals by the NRC necessary to support NRC authorization to load fuel, may arise, which may result in additional license amendments or require other resolution. As part of the aggressive site work plan, in January 2020, Southern Nuclear notified the NRC of its intent to load fuel in 2020. If any license amendment requests or other licensing-based compliance issues are not resolved in a timely manner, there may be delays in the project schedule that could result in increased costs.The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time. However, any extension of the regulatory-approved project schedule is currently estimated to result in additional base capital costs of approximately $50 million per month, based on Georgia Power's ownership interests, and AFUDC of approximately $12 million per month. While Georgia Power is not precluded from seeking recovery of any future capital cost forecast increase, management will ultimately determine whether or II-92 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2019 Annual Reportnot to seek recovery. Any further changes to the capital cost forecast that are not expected to be recoverable through regulated rates will be required to be charged to income and such charges could be material.Given the significant complexity involved in estimating the future costs to complete construction and start-up of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 and the significant management judgment necessary to assess the related uncertainties surrounding future rate recovery of any projected cost increases, as well as the potential impact on results of operations and cash flows, Southern Company and Georgia Power consider these items to be critical accounting estimates. See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Georgia Power – Nuclear Construction"" for additional information.Accounting for Income Taxes (Southern Company, Mississippi Power, Southern Power, and Southern Company Gas)The consolidated income tax provision and deferred income tax assets and liabilities, as well as any unrecognized tax benefits and valuation allowances, require significant judgment and estimates. These estimates are supported by historical tax return data, reasonable projections of taxable income, and interpretations of applicable tax laws and regulations across multiple taxing jurisdictions. The effective tax rate reflects the statutory tax rates and calculated apportionments for the various states in which the Southern Company system operates.On behalf of its subsidiaries, Southern Company files a consolidated federal income tax return and various state income tax returns, some of which are combined or unitary. Under a joint consolidated income tax allocation agreement, each Southern Company subsidiary's current and deferred tax expense is computed on a stand-alone basis and no subsidiary is allocated more current expense than would be paid if it filed a separate income tax return. Certain deductions and credits can be limited or utilized at the consolidated or combined level resulting in NOL and tax credit carryforwards that would not otherwise result on a stand-alone basis. Utilization of NOL and tax credit carryforwards and the assessment of valuation allowances are based on significant judgment and extensive analysis of Southern Company's and its subsidiaries' current financial position and results of operations, including currently available information about future years, to estimate when future taxable income will be realized.Current and deferred state income tax liabilities and assets are estimated based on laws of multiple states that determine the income to be apportioned to their jurisdictions. States utilize various formulas to calculate the apportionment of taxable income, primarily using sales, assets, or payroll within the jurisdiction compared to the consolidated totals. In addition, each state varies as to whether a stand-alone, combined, or unitary filing methodology is required. The calculation of deferred state taxes considers apportionment factors and filing methodologies that are expected to apply in future years. The apportionments and methodologies which are ultimately finalized in a manner inconsistent with expectations could have a material effect on the financial statements of the applicable Registrants.Given the significant judgment involved in estimating NOL and tax credit carryforwards and multi-state apportionments for all subsidiaries, the applicable Registrants consider deferred income tax liabilities and assets to be critical accounting estimates.Asset Retirement Obligations (Southern Company, Alabama Power, Georgia Power, Mississippi Power, and Southern Company Gas)AROs are computed as the present value of the estimated costs for an asset's future retirement and are recorded in the period in which the liability is incurred. The estimated costs are capitalized as part of the related long-lived asset and depreciated over the asset's useful life. In the absence of quoted market prices, AROs are estimated using present value techniques in which estimates of future cash outlays associated with the asset retirements are discounted using a credit-adjusted risk-free rate. Estimates of the timing and amounts of future cash outlays are based on projections of when and how the assets will be retired and the cost of future removal activities.The ARO liabilities for the traditional electric operating companies primarily relate to facilities that are subject to the CCR Rule and the related state rules, principally ash ponds. In addition, Alabama Power and Georgia Power have retirement obligations related to the decommissioning of nuclear facilities (Alabama Power's Plant Farley and Georgia Power's ownership interests in Plant Hatch and Plant Vogtle Units 1 and 2). The traditional electric operating companies also have AROs related to various landfill sites, asbestos removal, and underground storage tanks, as well as, for Alabama Power, disposal of polychlorinated biphenyls in certain transformers and sulfur hexafluoride gas in certain substation breakers, for Georgia Power, gypsum cells and restoration of land at the end of long-term land leases for solar facilities, and for Mississippi Power, mine reclamation and water wells.The traditional electric operating companies and Southern Company Gas also have identified other retirement obligations, such as obligations related to certain electric transmission and distribution facilities, certain asbestos-containing material within long-term assets not subject to ongoing repair and maintenance activities, certain wireless communication towers, the disposal of polychlorinated biphenyls in certain transformers, leasehold improvements, equipment on customer property, and property associated with the Southern Company system's rail lines and natural gas pipelines. However, liabilities for the removal of these II-93 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2019 Annual Reportassets have not been recorded because the settlement timing for certain retirement obligations related to these assets is indeterminable and, therefore, the fair value of the retirement obligations cannot be reasonably estimated. A liability for these retirement obligations will be recognized when sufficient information becomes available to support a reasonable estimation of the ARO.The cost estimates for AROs related to the disposal of CCR are based on information using various assumptions related to closure and post-closure costs, timing of future cash outlays, inflation and discount rates, and the potential methods for complying with the CCR Rule and the related state rules. The traditional electric operating companies expect to update their ARO cost estimates periodically as additional information related to these assumptions becomes available. See Note 6 to the financial statements for additional information, including increases to AROs related to ash ponds recorded during 2019 by certain Registrants.Given the significant judgment involved in estimating AROs, the applicable Registrants consider the liabilities for AROs to be critical accounting estimates.Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits (Southern Company, Alabama Power, Georgia Power, Mississippi Power, and Southern Company Gas)The applicable Registrants' calculations of pension and other postretirement benefits expense are dependent on a number of assumptions. These assumptions include discount rates, healthcare cost trend rates, expected long-term rate of return (LRR) on plan assets, mortality rates, expected salary and wage increases, and other factors. Components of pension and other postretirement benefits expense include interest and service cost on the pension and other postretirement benefit plans, expected return on plan assets, and amortization of certain unrecognized costs and obligations. Actual results that differ from the assumptions utilized are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, generally affect recognized expense and the recorded obligation in future periods. While the applicable Registrants believe the assumptions used are appropriate, differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions would affect their pension and other postretirement benefit costs and obligations.Key elements in determining the applicable Registrants' pension and other postretirement benefit expense are the LRR and the discount rate used to measure the benefit plan obligations and the periodic benefit plan expense for future periods. For purposes of determining the applicable Registrants' liabilities related to the pension and other postretirement benefit plans, Southern Company discounts the future related cash flows using a single-point discount rate for each plan developed from the weighted average of market-observed yields for high quality fixed income securities with maturities that correspond to expected benefit payments. The discount rate assumption impacts both the service cost and non-service costs components of net periodic benefit costs as well as the projected benefit obligations.The LRR on pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets is based on Southern Company's investment strategy, historical experience, and expectations that consider external actuarial advice, and represents the average rate of earnings expected over the long term on the assets invested to provide for anticipated future benefit payments. Southern Company determines the amount of the expected return on plan assets component of non-service costs by applying the LRR of various asset classes to Southern Company's target asset allocation. The LRR only impacts the non-service costs component of net periodic benefit costs for the following year and is set annually at the beginning of the year.For 2019, the LRR assumption for qualified pension plan assets was reduced from 7.95% to 7.75% for purposes of determining net periodic pension expense as a result of changes in the economic outlook used in estimating the expected returns as of December 31, 2018. As a result of the decrease in the LRR, the non-service costs component of net periodic pension expense increased by $24 million for the Southern Company system in 2019. See the table below for the impact on each Registrant.II-94 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2019 Annual ReportFor 2020, net periodic pension expense will be impacted by two factors: a change in the approach used to determine the LRR assumption and cash contributions totaling $1.1 billion to the qualified pension plan made in December 2019. Historically, Southern Company has set the LRR assumption using asset return modeling based on geometric returns that reflect the compound average returns for dependent annual periods. Beginning in 2020, Southern Company will set the LRR assumption using an arithmetic mean which represents the expected simple average return to be earned by the pension plan assets over any one year. Southern Company believes the use of the arithmetic mean is more compatible with the LRR's function of estimating a single year's investment return. Excluding the additional pension contribution in December 2019, the change in the LRR assumption will reduce the non-service costs component of net periodic pension expense by $78 million for the Southern Company system in 2020. See the table below for the impact on each Registrant. The contributions in 2019 will further reduce expense by $88 million for the Southern Company system in 2020.

The applicable Registrants have recognized goodwill as of the date of their acquisitions, as a residual over the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis in the fourth quarter of the year as well as on an interim basis as events and changes in circumstances occur, including, but not limited to, a significant change in operating performance, the business climate, legal or regulatory factors, or a planned sale or disposition of a significant portion of the business. A reporting unit is the operating segment, or a business one level below the operating segment (a component), if discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by management. Components are aggregated if they have similar economic characteristics.As part of the impairment tests, the applicable Registrant may perform an initial qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit is less than its carrying amount before applying the quantitative goodwill impairment test. If the applicable Registrant elects to perform the qualitative assessment, it evaluates relevant events and circumstances, including but not limited to, macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, cost factors, financial performance, entity specific events, and events specific to each reporting unit. If the applicable Registrant determines that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, or it elects not to perform a qualitative assessment, it compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value to determine if the fair value is greater than its carrying value.Goodwill for Southern Company and Southern Company Gas was $5.3 billion and $5.0 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2019. For its 2019 and 2018 annual impairment tests, Southern Company Gas performed the qualitative assessment and determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of all of its reporting units with goodwill exceeded their carrying amounts, and therefore no quantitative analysis was required. For its 2017 annual impairment test, Southern Company Gas performed the quantitative assessment, which resulted in the fair value of all of its reporting units that have goodwill exceeding their carrying value. For its annual impairment tests for PowerSecure, Southern Company performed the quantitative assessment, which resulted in the fair value of goodwill at PowerSecure exceeding its carrying value in all years presented. However, Southern Company recorded goodwill impairment charges totaling $34 million in 2019 as a result of its decision to sell certain PowerSecure business units. See Note 15 to the financial statements under ""Southern Company"" for additional information.The judgments made in determining the estimated fair value assigned to each class of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as well as asset lives, can significantly impact the applicable Registrant's results of operations. Fair values and useful lives are determined based on, among other factors, the expected future period of benefit of the asset, the various characteristics of the asset, and projected cash flows. As the determination of an asset's fair value and useful life involves management making certain estimates and because these estimates form the basis for the determination of whether or not an impairment charge should be recorded, the applicable Registrants consider these estimates to be critical accounting estimates.See Note 1 to the financial statements under ""Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets and Liabilities"" for additional information regarding the applicable Registrants' goodwill.Long-Lived Assets (Southern Company, Southern Power, and Southern Company Gas)Impairments of long-lived assets of the traditional electric utilities and natural gas distribution utilities are generally related to specific regulatory disallowances. The applicable Registrants assess their other long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset's carrying amount may not be recoverable. If an indicator exists, the asset is tested for recoverability by comparing the asset carrying value to the sum of the undiscounted expected future cash flows directly attributable to the asset's use and eventual disposition. If the estimate of undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset, the fair value of the asset is determined and a loss is recorded equal to the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the asset. In addition, when assets are identified as held for sale, an impairment loss is recognized to the extent the carrying value of the assets or asset group exceeds their fair value less cost to sell. A high degree of judgment is required in developing estimates related to these evaluations, which are based on projections of various factors, some of which have been quite volatile in recent years.Southern Power's investments in long-lived assets are primarily generation assets, whether in service or under construction. Excluding the natural gas distribution utilities, Southern Company Gas' investments in long-lived assets are primarily natural gas transportation and storage facility assets, whether in service or under construction. In addition, exclusive of the traditional electric operating companies and natural gas distribution utilities, Southern Company's investments in long-lived assets also include investments in leveraged leases.II-96 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2019 Annual ReportFor Southern Power, examples of impairment indicators could include significant changes in construction schedules, current period losses combined with a history of losses or a projection of continuing losses, a significant decrease in market prices, the inability to remarket generating capacity for an extended period, the unplanned termination of a customer contract or the inability of a customer to perform under the terms of the contract, or the inability to deploy wind turbine equipment to a development project. For Southern Company Gas, examples of impairment indicators could include, but are not limited to, significant changes in the U.S. natural gas storage market, construction schedules, current period losses combined with a history of losses or a projection of continuing losses, a significant decrease in market prices, the inability to renew or extend customer contracts or the inability of a customer to perform under the terms of the contract, attrition rates, or the inability to deploy a development project. For Southern Company's investments in leveraged leases, impairment indicators include changes in estimates of future rental payments to be received under the lease as well as the residual value of the leased asset at the end of the lease.As the determination of the expected future cash flows generated from an asset, an asset's fair value, and useful life involves management making certain estimates and because these estimates form the basis for the determination of whether or not an impairment charge should be recorded, the applicable Registrants consider these estimates to be critical accounting estimates.See Note 3 to the financial statements under ""Other Matters"" and Note 15 to the financial statements for information on certain assets recently evaluated for impairment.Derivatives and Hedging Activities (Southern Company and Southern Company Gas)Determining whether a contract meets the definition of a derivative instrument, contains an embedded derivative requiring bifurcation, or qualifies for hedge accounting treatment is complex. The treatment of a single contract may vary from period to period depending upon accounting elections, changes in the applicable Registrant's assessment of the likelihood of future hedged transactions, or new interpretations of accounting guidance. As a result, judgment is required in determining the appropriate accounting treatment. In addition, the estimated fair value of derivative instruments may change significantly from period to period depending upon market conditions, and changes in hedge effectiveness may impact the accounting treatment.Derivative instruments (including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts) are recorded on the balance sheets as either assets or liabilities measured at their fair value. If the transaction qualifies for, and is designated as, a normal purchase or normal sale, it is exempt from fair value accounting treatment and is, instead, subject to traditional accrual accounting. The applicable Registrant utilizes market data or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the derivative asset or liability, including assumptions about risk and the risks inherent in the inputs of the valuation technique.Changes in the derivatives' fair value are recognized concurrently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met. If the derivatives meet those criteria, derivative gains and losses offset related results of the hedged item in the income statement in the case of a fair value hedge, or gains and losses are deferred in OCI on the balance sheets until the hedged transaction affects earnings in the case of a cash flow hedge. Additionally, a company is required to formally designate a derivative as a hedge as well as document and assess the effectiveness of derivatives associated with transactions that receive hedge accounting treatment.Southern Company Gas uses derivative instruments primarily to reduce the impact to its results of operations due to the risk of changes in the price of natural gas and, to a lesser extent, Southern Company Gas hedges against warmer-than-normal weather and interest rates. The fair value of natural gas derivative instruments used to manage exposure to changing natural gas prices reflects the estimated amounts that Southern Company Gas would receive or pay to terminate or close the contracts at the reporting date, taking into account the current unrealized gains or losses on open contracts. For derivatives utilized at gas marketing services and wholesale gas services that are not designated as accounting hedges, changes in fair value are reported as gains or losses in results of operations in the period of change. Gas marketing services records derivative gains or losses arising from cash flow hedges in OCI and reclassifies them into earnings in the same period that the underlying hedged item is recognized in earnings.Derivative assets and liabilities are classified based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment and may affect the valuation of fair value assets and liabilities and their placement within the fair value hierarchy. The determination of the fair value of the derivative instruments incorporates various required factors. These factors include:•the creditworthiness of the counterparties involved and the impact of credit enhancements (such as cash deposits and letters of credit);•events specific to a given counterparty; and•the impact of nonperformance risk on liabilities.A significant change in the underlying market prices or pricing assumptions used in pricing derivative assets or liabilities may result in a significant financial statement impact.II-97 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2019 Annual ReportGiven the assumptions used in pricing the derivative asset or liability, Southern Company and Southern Company Gas consider the valuation of derivative assets and liabilities a critical accounting estimate. See FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY – ""Market Price Risk"" herein and Note 14 to the financial statements for more information.Revenue Recognition (Southern Power)Southern Power's power sale transactions, which include PPAs, are classified in one of four general categories: leases, non-derivatives or normal sale derivatives, derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, and derivatives not designated as hedges, as described further below. For more information on derivative transactions, see FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY – ""Market Price Risk"" herein and Notes 1 and 14 to the financial statements. Southern Power's revenues are dependent upon significant judgments used to determine the appropriate transaction classification, which must be documented upon the inception of each contract.Lease TransactionsSouthern Power considers the following factors to determine whether the sales contract is a lease:•Assessing whether specific property is explicitly or implicitly identified in the agreement;•Determining whether the fulfillment of the arrangement is dependent on the use of the identified property; and•Assessing whether the arrangement conveys to the counterparty substantially all of the economic benefits and the right to direct the use of the asset.If the contract meets the above criteria for a lease, Southern Power performs further analysis as to whether the lease is classified as operating, financing, or sales-type. All of Southern Power's power sales contracts that are determined to be leases are accounted for as operating leases and the capacity revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract and is included in Southern Power's operating revenues. Energy revenues and other contingent revenues are recognized in the period the energy is delivered or the service is rendered. See Note 9 to the financial statements for additional information.Non-Derivative and Normal Sale Derivative TransactionsIf the power sales contract is not classified as a lease, Southern Power further considers the following factors to determine proper classification:•Assessing whether the contract meets the definition of a derivative;•Assessing whether the contract meets the definition of a capacity contract;•Assessing the probability at inception and throughout the term of the individual contract that the contract will result in physical delivery; and•Ensuring that the contract quantities do not exceed available generating capacity (including purchased capacity).Contracts that do not meet the definition of a derivative or are designated as normal sales (i.e. capacity contracts which provide for the sale of electricity that involve physical delivery in quantities within Southern Power's available generating capacity) are accounted for as executory contracts. For contracts that have a capacity charge, the revenue is generally recognized in the period that it becomes billable. Revenues related to energy and ancillary services are recognized in the period the energy is delivered or the service is rendered. See Note 4 to the financial statements for additional information.Cash Flow Hedge TransactionsSouthern Power further considers the following in designating other derivative contracts for the sale of electricity as cash flow hedges of anticipated sale transactions:•Identifying the hedging instrument, the forecasted hedged transaction, and the nature of the risk being hedged; and•Assessing hedge effectiveness at inception and throughout the contract term. These contracts are accounted for on a fair value basis and are recorded in AOCI over the life of the contract. Realized gains and losses are then recognized in operating revenues as incurred.Derivative (Non-Hedge) TransactionsContracts for sales of electricity, which meet the definition of a derivative and that either do not qualify or are not designated as normal sales or as cash flow hedges, are accounted for on a fair value basis and are recorded in operating revenues.II-98 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2019 Annual ReportAcquisition Accounting (Southern Power)Southern Power may acquire generation assets as part of its overall growth strategy. At the time of an acquisition, Southern Power will assess if these assets and activities meet the definition of a business. For acquisitions that meet the definition of a business, the purchase price, including any contingent consideration, is allocated based on the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed (including any intangible assets, primarily related to acquired PPAs). Assets acquired that do not meet the definition of a business are accounted for as an asset acquisition. The purchase price of each asset acquisition is allocated based on the relative fair value of assets acquired. Determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management judgment and Southern Power may engage independent valuation experts to assist in this process. Fair values are determined by using market participant assumptions, and typically include the timing and amounts of future cash flows, incurred construction costs, the nature of acquired contracts, discount rates, power market prices, and expected asset lives. Any due diligence or transition costs incurred by Southern Power for potential or successful acquisitions are expensed as incurred.Contingent consideration primarily relates to fixed amounts due to the seller once the facility is placed in service. For contingent consideration with variable payments, Southern Power fair values the arrangement with any changes recorded in the consolidated statements of income. See Note 13 to the financial statements for additional fair value information and Note 15 to the financial statements for additional information on recent acquisitions.Variable Interest Entities (Southern Power)Southern Power enters into partnerships with varying ownership structures. Upon entering into such arrangements, membership interests and other variable interests are evaluated to determine if the legal entity is a VIE. If the legal entity is a VIE, Southern Power will assess if it has both the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE, making it the primary beneficiary. Making this determination may require significant management judgment.If Southern Power is the primary beneficiary, the assets, liabilities, and results of operations of the entity are consolidated. If Southern Power is not the primary beneficiary, the legal entity is generally accounted for under the equity method of accounting. Southern Power reconsiders its conclusions as to whether the legal entity is a VIE and whether it is the primary beneficiary for events that impact the rights of variable interests, such as ownership changes in membership interests.Southern Power has partial ownership in certain legal entities for which the contractual provisions represent profit-sharing arrangements because the allocations of cash distributions and tax benefits are not based on fixed ownership percentages. For these arrangements, the noncontrolling interest is accounted for under a balance sheet approach utilizing the HLBV method. The HLBV method calculates each partner's share of income based on the change in net equity the partner can legally claim in a HLBV at the end of the period compared to the beginning of the period.Contingent Obligations (All Registrants)The Registrants are subject to a number of federal and state laws and regulations, as well as other factors and conditions that subject them to environmental, litigation, and other risks. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL herein and Notes 2 and 3 to the financial statements for more information regarding certain of these contingencies. The Registrants periodically evaluate their exposure to such risks and record reserves for those matters where a non-tax-related loss is considered probable and reasonably estimable. The adequacy of reserves can be significantly affected by external events or conditions that can be unpredictable; thus, the ultimate outcome of such matters could materially affect the results of operations, cash flows, or financial condition of the Registrants.Recently Issued Accounting StandardsSee Note 1 to the financial statements under ""Recently Adopted Accounting Standards"" for additional information.In 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) (ASU 2016-02). ASU 2016-02 requires lessees to recognize on the balance sheet a lease liability and a right-of-use asset for all leases. ASU 2016-02 also changes the recognition, measurement, and presentation of expense associated with leases and provides clarification regarding the identification of certain components of contracts that would represent a lease. The accounting required by lessors is relatively unchanged and there is no change to the accounting for existing leveraged leases. The Registrants adopted the new standard effective January 1, 2019. See Note 9 to the financial statements for additional information and related disclosures.II-99 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2019 Annual ReportFINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITYOverviewThe financial condition of each Registrant remained stable at December 31, 2019. The Registrants' cash requirements primarily consist of funding ongoing operations, including unconsolidated subsidiaries, as well as common stock dividends, capital expenditures, and debt maturities. Southern Power's cash requirements also include distributions to noncontrolling interests. Capital expenditures and other investing activities for the traditional electric operating companies include investments to meet projected long-term demand requirements, including to build new generation facilities, to maintain existing generation facilities, to comply with environmental regulations including adding environmental modifications to certain existing generating units and closures of ash ponds, to expand and improve transmission and distribution facilities, and for restoration following major storms. Southern Power's capital expenditures and other investing activities may include acquisitions or new construction associated with its overall growth strategy and to maintain its existing generation fleet's performance. Southern Company Gas' capital expenditures and other investing activities include investments to meet projected long-term demand requirements, to maintain existing natural gas distribution systems as well as to update and expand these systems, and to comply with environmental regulations.Operating cash flows provide a substantial portion of the Registrants' cash needs. During 2019, Southern Power utilized tax credits, which provided $734 million in operating cash flows. For the three-year period from 2020 through 2022, each Registrant's projected stock dividends, capital expenditures, and debt maturities, as well as distributions to noncontrolling interests for Southern Power, are expected to exceed its operating cash flows. Southern Company plans to finance future cash needs in excess of its operating cash flows primarily by accessing borrowings from financial institutions and issuing debt and hybrid securities in the capital markets. Each Subsidiary Registrant plans to finance its future cash needs in excess of its operating cash flows primarily through external securities issuances, borrowings from financial institutions, and equity contributions from Southern Company. In addition, Georgia Power plans to utilize borrowings through the FFB and Southern Power plans to utilize tax equity partnership contributions. The Registrants plan to use commercial paper to manage seasonal variations in operating cash flows and for other working capital needs and continue to monitor their access to short-term and long-term capital markets as well as their bank credit arrangements to meet future capital and liquidity needs. See ""Sources of Capital,"" ""Financing Activities,"" ""Capital Requirements,"" and ""Contractual Obligations"" herein for additional information.The Registrants' investments in their qualified pension plans and Alabama Power's and Georgia Power's investments in their nuclear decommissioning trust funds increased in value at December 31, 2019 as compared to December 31, 2018. In December 2019, the Registrants voluntarily contributed the following amounts to the qualified pension plan: Southern CompanyAlabama PowerGeorgia PowerMississippi PowerSouthern PowerSouthern Company Gas (in millions)Contributions to qualified pension plan$1,136$362$200$54$24$145No mandatory contributions to the qualified pension plans are anticipated during 2020.

At December 31, 2019, Southern Power had $1.4 billion of unutilized ITCs and PTCs which are expected to be fully utilized by 2024. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – ""Income Tax Matters – Tax Credits"" herein for additional information.The net cash used for investing activities in 2019 was primarily due to Southern Power's investment in DSGP and ongoing construction activities, largely offset by proceeds from the sales of Plant Nacogdoches and certain wind turbine equipment. The net cash used for investing activities in 2018 was primarily due to the construction of generating facilities and payments for renewable acquisitions, partially offset by proceeds from the disposition of the Florida Plants. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – ""Acquisitions and Dispositions"" and ""Construction Programs"" herein and Note 15 to the financial statements for additional information.The net cash used for financing activities in 2019 was primarily due to returns of capital to Southern Company, the repayment at maturity of senior notes, payments of common stock dividends, and distributions to noncontrolling interests, partially offset by proceeds from net issuances of commercial paper. The net cash used for financing activities in 2018 was primarily due to returns of capital to Southern Company, payments of common stock dividends, and distributions to noncontrolling interests, partially offset by capital contributions from noncontrolling interests.Southern Company GasNet cash provided from operating activities increased $303 million in 2019 as compared to 2018 primarily due to the timing of collection of customer receivables and lower income tax payments, partially offset by the timing of vendor payments and the voluntary contribution to the qualified pension plan.The net cash used for investing activities in 2019 was primarily due to gross property additions related to utility capital expenditures and infrastructure investments recovered through replacement programs at gas distribution operations and capital contributed to equity method pipeline investments, partially offset by proceeds from the sale of Triton and capital distributions in excess of earnings from equity method pipeline investments.

Equity capital can be provided from any combination of Southern Company's stock plans, private placements, or public offerings. Southern Company does not expect to issue any equity in the capital markets through 2024.The Subsidiary Registrants plan to obtain the funds to meet their future capital needs from sources similar to those they used in the past, which were primarily from operating cash flows, external securities issuances, borrowings from financial institutions, and equity contributions from Southern Company. In addition, Georgia Power plans to utilize borrowings from the FFB, as discussed further in Note 8 to the financial statements under ""Long-term Debt – DOE Loan Guarantee Borrowings,"" Southern Power plans to utilize tax equity partnership contributions, as discussed further herein, and Southern Company Gas plans to utilize proceeds from the pending sale of its interests in Pivotal LNG and Atlantic Coast Pipeline, as discussed further in Note 15 to the financial statements under ""Southern Company Gas – Proposed Sale of Pivotal LNG and Atlantic Coast Pipeline.""The amount, type, and timing of any financings in 2020, as well as in subsequent years, will be contingent on investment opportunities and the Registrants' capital requirements and will depend upon prevailing market conditions, regulatory approvals (for the Subsidiary Registrants), and other factors. See ""Capital Requirements"" herein for additional information.Southern Power utilizes tax equity partnerships as one of its financing sources, where the tax partner takes significantly all of the federal tax benefits. These tax equity partnerships are consolidated in Southern Power's financial statements and are accounted for using HLBV methodology to allocate partnership gains and losses. During 2019, Southern Power obtained tax equity funding for the Wildhorse Mountain wind project and received proceeds of $97 million. See Notes 1 and 15 to the financial statements under ""General"" and ""Southern Power,"" respectively, for additional information.The issuance of securities by the traditional electric operating companies and Nicor Gas is generally subject to the approval of the applicable state PSC or other applicable state regulatory agency. The issuance of all securities by Mississippi Power and short-term securities by Georgia Power is generally subject to regulatory approval by the FERC. Additionally, with respect to the public offering of securities, Southern Company, the traditional electric operating companies, and Southern Power (excluding its subsidiaries), Southern Company Gas Capital, and Southern Company Gas (excluding its other subsidiaries) file registration statements with the SEC under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (1933 Act). The amounts of securities authorized by the appropriate regulatory authorities, as well as the securities registered under the 1933 Act, are closely monitored and appropriate filings are made to ensure flexibility in the capital markets.The Registrants generally obtain financing separately without credit support from any affiliate. See Note 8 to the financial statements under ""Bank Credit Arrangements"" for additional information. The Southern Company system does not maintain a centralized cash or money pool. Therefore, funds of each company are not commingled with funds of any other company in the Southern Company system, except in the case of Southern Company Gas, as described below.The traditional electric operating companies and SEGCO may utilize a Southern Company subsidiary organized to issue and sell commercial paper at their request and for their benefit. Proceeds from such issuances for the benefit of an individual company are loaned directly to that company. The obligations of each traditional electric operating company and SEGCO under these arrangements are several and there is no cross-affiliate credit support. Alabama Power also maintains its own separate commercial paper program.Southern Company Gas Capital obtains external financing for Southern Company Gas and its subsidiaries, other than Nicor Gas, which obtains financing separately without credit support from any affiliates. Southern Company Gas maintains commercial II-105 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2019 Annual Reportpaper programs at Southern Company Gas Capital and Nicor Gas. Nicor Gas' commercial paper program supports its working capital needs as Nicor Gas is not permitted to make money pool loans to affiliates. All of the other Southern Company Gas subsidiaries benefit from Southern Company Gas Capital's commercial paper program.By regulation, Nicor Gas is restricted, to the extent of its retained earnings balance, in the amount it can dividend or loan to affiliates and is not permitted to make money pool loans to affiliates. At December 31, 2019, the amount of subsidiary retained earnings restricted to dividend totaled $951 million. This restriction did not impact Southern Company Gas' ability to meet its cash obligations, nor does management expect such restriction to materially impact Southern Company Gas' ability to meet its currently anticipated cash obligations.The Registrants' current liabilities frequently exceed their current assets because of long-term debt maturities and the periodic use of short-term debt as a funding source, as well as significant seasonal fluctuations in cash needs. See Note 8 to the financial statements for additional information. Also see ""Financing Activities"" herein for information on issuances of long-term debt subsequent to December 31, 2019. At December 31, 2019, the following Registrants' current liabilities exceeded their current assets, primarily as a result of securities due within one year and notes payable, as shown in the table below:At December 31, 2019Southern Company(*)GeorgiaPowerMississippi PowerSouthern Power (in millions)Current liabilities in excess of current assets$2,729$1,902$125$945Securities due within one year2,9891,025281824Notes payable2,055365—549(*)Includes $600 million and $465 million of securities due within one year and notes payable, respectively, at the parent company.The Registrants believe the need for working capital can be adequately met by utilizing operating cash flows, as well as commercial paper, lines of credit, and short-term bank notes, as market conditions permit. In addition, under certain circumstances, the Subsidiary Registrants may utilize equity contributions and/or loans from Southern Company.Bank Credit ArrangementsAt December 31, 2019, the Registrants' unused committed credit arrangements with banks were as follows:At December 31, 2019SouthernCompanyparentAlabama PowerGeorgiaPowerMississippi PowerSouthern Power(a)Southern Company Gas(b)SEGCOSouthernCompany (in millions)Unused committed credit$1,999$1,328$1,733$150$591$1,745$30$7,576(a)At December 31, 2019, Southern Power also had a continuing letter of credit facility for standby letters of credit, of which $23 million was unused.

Southern Power's subsidiaries are not parties to its bank credit arrangement or to the letter of credit facilities.(b)Includes $1.245 billion and $500 million at Southern Company Gas Capital and Nicor Gas, respectively.Subject to applicable market conditions, the Registrants, Nicor Gas, and SEGCO expect to renew or replace their bank credit arrangements as needed, prior to expiration. In connection therewith, the Registrants, Nicor Gas, and SEGCO may extend the maturity dates and/or increase or decrease the lending commitments thereunder. A portion of the unused credit with banks is allocated to provide liquidity support to the revenue bonds of the traditional electric operating companies and the commercial paper programs of the Registrants, Nicor Gas, and SEGCO. See Note 8 to the financial statements under ""Bank Credit Arrangements"" for additional information.Short-term BorrowingsThe Registrants, Nicor Gas, and SEGCO make short-term borrowings primarily through commercial paper programs that have the liquidity support of the committed bank credit arrangements described above. Southern Power's subsidiaries are not issuers or obligors under its commercial paper program. Commercial paper and short-term bank term loans are included in notes payable in the balance sheets.

Subsequent to December 31, 2019, Southern Power repaid the bank loan.Southern Company GasIn July 2019, Nicor Gas repaid at maturity $50 million aggregate principal amount of its 4.7% first mortgage bonds.In August 2019, Southern Company Gas Capital repaid at maturity $300 million aggregate principal amount of its 5.25% Senior Notes.In August and October 2019, Nicor Gas issued $200 million and $100 million, respectively, aggregate principal amount of first mortgage bonds in a private placement.Credit Rating RiskAt December 31, 2019, the Registrants did not have any credit arrangements that would require material changes in payment schedules or terminations as a result of a credit rating downgrade.There are certain contracts that could require collateral, but not accelerated payment, in the event of a credit rating change of certain Registrants to BBB and/or Baa2 or below. These contracts are primarily for physical electricity and natural gas purchases and sales, fuel purchases, fuel transportation and storage, energy price risk management, transmission, interest rate management, and, for Georgia Power, construction of new generation at Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4.The maximum potential collateral requirements under these contracts at December 31, 2019 were as follows:Credit RatingsSouthern Company(*)Alabama PowerGeorgia PowerMississippi PowerSouthernPower(*)Southern Company Gas (in millions)At BBB and/or Baa2$36$1$—$—$35$—At BBB- and/or Baa3472186—385—At BB+ and/or Ba1 or below2,0403221,0202671,17418(*)Excludes amounts related to Plant Mankato, which was sold on January 17, 2020. Southern Power has PPAs that could require collateral, but not accelerated payment, in the event of a downgrade of Southern Power's credit. The PPAs require credit assurances without stating a specific credit rating. The amount of collateral required would depend upon actual losses resulting from a credit downgrade. Southern Power had $104 million of cash collateral posted related to PPA requirements at December 31, 2019. The potential collateral requirement amounts in the previous table for the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power include certain agreements that could require collateral in the event that either Alabama Power or Georgia Power has a credit rating change to below investment grade. Generally, collateral may be provided by a Southern Company guaranty, letter of credit, or cash. Additionally, a credit rating downgrade could impact the ability of the Registrants to access capital markets and would be likely to impact the cost at which they do so.Mississippi Power and its largest retail customer, Chevron, have agreements under which Mississippi Power continues to provide retail service to the Chevron refinery in Pascagoula, Mississippi through 2038. The agreements grant Chevron a security interest in the co-generation assets located at the refinery that is exercisable upon the occurrence of (i) certain bankruptcy events or (ii) other events of default coupled with specific reductions in steam output at the facility and a downgrade of Mississippi Power's credit rating to below investment grade by two of the three rating agencies.On August 1, 2019, Moody's upgraded Mississippi Power's senior unsecured long-term debt rating to Baa2 from Baa3 and maintained the positive rating outlook.On September 12, 2019, S&P upgraded the senior unsecured long-term debt rating of Alabama Power to A from A-, the long-term issuer rating of Nicor Gas to A from A-, and the senior secured debt rating of Nicor Gas to A+ from A. The ratings outlooks remained negative.II-110 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2019 Annual ReportMarket Price RiskThe Registrants are exposed to market risks, including commodity price risk, interest rate risk, weather risk, and occasionally foreign currency exchange rate risk. To manage the volatility attributable to these exposures, the applicable company nets the exposures, where possible, to take advantage of natural offsets and enters into various derivative transactions for the remaining exposures pursuant to the applicable company's policies in areas such as counterparty exposure and risk management practices. Southern Company Gas' wholesale gas operations uses various contracts in its commercial activities that generally meet the definition of derivatives. For the traditional electric operating companies, Southern Power, and Southern Company Gas' other businesses, each company's policy is that derivatives are to be used primarily for hedging purposes and mandates strict adherence to all applicable risk management policies. Derivative positions are monitored using techniques including, but not limited to, market valuation, value at risk, stress testing, and sensitivity analysis.Due to cost-based rate regulation and other various cost recovery mechanisms, the traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities that sell natural gas directly to end-use customers continue to have limited exposure to market volatility in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, commodity fuel prices, and prices of electricity. The traditional electric operating companies and certain of the natural gas distribution utilities manage fuel-hedging programs implemented per the guidelines of their respective state PSCs or other applicable state regulatory agencies to hedge the impact of market fluctuations in natural gas prices for customers. Mississippi Power also manages wholesale fuel-hedging programs under agreements with its wholesale customers. Because energy from Southern Power's facilities is primarily sold under long-term PPAs with tolling agreements and provisions shifting substantially all of the responsibility for fuel cost to the counterparties, Southern Power's exposure to market volatility in commodity fuel prices and prices of electricity is generally limited. However, Southern Power has been and may continue to be exposed to market volatility in energy-related commodity prices as a result of uncontracted generating capacity. To mitigate residual risks relative to movements in electricity prices, the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power may enter into physical fixed-price contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity through the wholesale electricity market and, to a lesser extent, financial hedge contracts for natural gas purchases; however, a significant portion of contracts are priced at market.Certain of Southern Company Gas' non-regulated operations routinely utilize various types of derivative instruments to economically hedge certain commodity price and weather risks inherent in the natural gas industry. These instruments include a variety of exchange-traded and OTC energy contracts, such as forward contracts, futures contracts, options contracts, and swap agreements. Southern Company Gas' gas marketing services and wholesale gas services businesses also actively manage storage positions through a variety of hedging transactions for the purpose of managing exposures arising from changing natural gas prices. These hedging instruments are used to substantially protect economic margins (as spreads between wholesale and retail natural gas prices widen between periods) and thereby minimize exposure to declining operating margins. Some of these economic hedge activities may not qualify, or may not be designated, for hedge accounting treatment.The Registrants had no material change in market risk exposure for the year ended December 31, 2019 when compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. See Note 1 to the financial statements under ""Financial Instruments"" and Note 14 to the financial statements for additional information.The Registrants may enter into interest rate derivatives designated as hedges, which are intended to mitigate interest rate volatility related to forecasted debt financings and existing fixed and floating rate obligations. Outstanding interest rate derivatives at December 31, 2019 are as follows:At December 31, 2019Southern Company(*)GeorgiaPowerSouthern CompanyGas (in millions)Hedges of forecasted debt$700$500$200Hedges of existing debt1,800——Total$2,500$500$200(*)Includes $1.8 billion of hedges of existing debt at the Southern Company parent.II-111 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2019 Annual ReportThe following table provides information related to variable interest rate exposure on long-term debt (including amounts due within one year) at December 31, 2019 for the applicable Registrants:At December 31, 2019Southern Company(*)AlabamaPowerGeorgiaPowerMississippiPowerSouthernPower (in millions, except percentages)Long-term variable interest rate exposure$4,063$1,079$550$308$525Weighted average interest rate on long-term variable interest rate exposure2.38%2.35%1.74%2.51%2.46%Impact on annualized interest expense of 100 basis point change in interest rates$41$11$6$3$5(*)Includes $1.5 billion of long-term variable interest rate exposure at the Southern Company parent entity.Southern Power Company had foreign currency denominated debt of €1.1 billion at December 31, 2019. Southern Power Company has mitigated its exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk through the use of foreign currency swaps converting all interest and principal payments to fixed-rate U.S. dollars.The changes in fair value of energy-related derivative contracts for Southern Company and Southern Company Gas for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 are provided in the table below.

Current period changes also include the changes in fair value of new contracts entered into during the period, if any.The net hedge volumes of energy-related derivative contracts for natural gas purchased (sold) at December 31, 2019 and 2018 for Southern Company and Southern Company Gas were as follows: Southern CompanySouthern Company Gas mmBtu Volume (in millions)At December 31, 2019: Commodity – Natural gas swaps327—Commodity – Natural gas options262218Total hedge volume589218 At December 31, 2018: Commodity – Natural gas swaps287—Commodity – Natural gas options144120Total hedge volume431120II-112 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2019 Annual ReportSouthern Company Gas' derivative contracts are comprised of both long and short natural gas positions. A long position is a contract to purchase natural gas, and a short position is a contract to sell natural gas. The volumes presented above for Southern Company Gas represent the net of long natural gas positions of 4.10 billion mmBtu and short natural gas positions of 3.88 billion mmBtu at December 31, 2019 and the net of long natural gas positions of 4.16 billion mmBtu and short natural gas positions of 4.04 billion mmBtu at December 31, 2018.For the Southern Company system, the weighted average swap contract cost above market prices was approximately $0.28 and $0.12 per mmBtu at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The change in option fair value is primarily attributable to the volatility of the market and the underlying change in the natural gas price. Substantially all of the traditional electric operating companies' natural gas hedge gains and losses are recovered through their respective fuel cost recovery clauses.At December 31, 2019 and 2018, substantially all of the traditional electric operating companies' and certain of the natural gas distribution utilities' energy-related derivative contracts were designated as regulatory hedges and were related to the applicable company's fuel-hedging program. Gains and losses associated with regulatory hedges are initially recorded as regulatory liabilities and assets, respectively, and then are included in fuel expense/cost of natural gas as they are recovered through their respective cost recovery clause. Gains and losses on energy-related derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, which are used to hedge anticipated purchases and sales, are initially deferred in AOCI before being recognized in income in the same period as the hedged transaction. Gains and losses on energy-related derivative contracts that are not designated or fail to qualify as hedges are recognized in the statements of income as incurred. See Note 14 to the financial statements for additional information.Some energy-related derivative contracts require physical delivery as opposed to financial settlement, and this type of derivative is both common and prevalent within the electric and natural gas industries. When an energy-related derivative contract is settled physically, any cumulative unrealized gain or loss is reversed and the contract price is recognized in the respective line item representing the actual price of the underlying goods being delivered.The Registrants use over-the-counter contracts that are not exchange traded but are fair valued using prices which are market observable, and thus fall into Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. In addition, Southern Company Gas uses exchange-traded market-observable contracts, which are categorized as Level 1, and contracts that include a combination of observable and unobservable components, which are categorized as Level 3. See Note 13 to the financial statements for further discussion of fair value measurements. The maturities of the energy-related derivative contracts for Southern Company and Southern Company Gas at December 31, 2019 were as follows: Fair Value Measurements of Contracts at December 31, 2019 TotalFair Value Maturity Year 1 Years 2&3 Years 4&5 (in millions)Southern Company Level 1(a)$(53) $(19) $(37) $3Level 2(b)18 42 (25) 1Level 314 10 1 3Southern Company total(c)$(21) $33 $(61) $7 Southern Company Gas Level 1(a)$(53) $(19) $(37) $3Level 2(b)111 98 11 2Level 314 10 1 3Southern Company Gas total(c)$72 $89 $(25) $8(a)Valued using NYMEX futures prices.(b)Level 2 amounts for Southern Company Gas are valued using basis transactions that represent the cost to transport natural gas from a NYMEX delivery point to the contract delivery point.

The Registrants only enter into agreements and material transactions with counterparties that have II-113 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2019 Annual Reportinvestment grade credit ratings by Moody's and S&P, or with counterparties who have posted collateral to cover potential credit exposure. Therefore, the Registrants do not anticipate market risk exposure from nonperformance by the counterparties. For additional information, see Note 1 to the financial statements under ""Financial Instruments"" and Note 14 to the financial statements.Southern Company performs periodic reviews of its leveraged lease transactions, both domestic and international, and the creditworthiness of the lessees, including a review of the value of the underlying leased assets and the credit ratings of the lessees. Southern Company's domestic lease transactions generally do not have any credit enhancement mechanisms; however, the lessees in its international lease transactions have pledged various deposits as additional security to secure the obligations. The lessees in Southern Company's international lease transactions are also required to provide additional collateral in the event of a credit downgrade below a certain level. See Notes 1 and 3 to the financial statements under ""Leveraged Leases"" and ""Other Matters – Southern Company,"" respectively, for additional information.Southern Company Gas Value at Risk (VaR)VaR is the maximum potential loss in portfolio value over a specified time period that is not expected to be exceeded within a given degree of probability. Southern Company Gas' VaR may not be comparable to that of other companies due to differences in the factors used to calculate VaR. Southern Company Gas' VaR is determined on a 95% confidence interval and a one-day holding period, which means that 95% of the time, the risk of loss in a day from a portfolio of positions is expected to be less than or equal to the amount of VaR calculated. The open exposure of Southern Company Gas is managed in accordance with established policies that limit market risk and require daily reporting of potential financial exposure to senior management. Because Southern Company Gas generally manages physical gas assets and economically protects its positions by hedging in the futures markets, Southern Company Gas' open exposure is generally mitigated. Southern Company Gas employs daily risk testing, using both VaR and stress testing, to evaluate the risk of its positions.Southern Company Gas actively monitors open commodity positions and the resulting VaR and maintains a relatively small risk exposure as total buy volume is close to sell volume, with minimal open natural gas price risk. Based on a 95% confidence interval and employing a one-day holding period, SouthStar's portfolio of positions for all periods presented was immaterial. Southern Company Gas' wholesale gas services segment had the following VaRs at December 31: 201920182017 (in millions)Period end(*)$2.6$6.4$4.8Average3.43.72.0High(*)7.011.74.8Low2.11.21.0(*)The increase in VaR at December 31, 2018 reflects significant natural gas price increases in Sequent's key markets driven by an industry-wide lower-than-normal natural gas storage inventory position and colder-than-normal weather in the middle of fourth quarter 2018. As weather and natural gas prices moderated subsequent to December 31, 2018, VaR reduced.Credit RiskSouthern Company (except as discussed herein), the traditional electric operating companies, and Southern Power are not exposed to any concentrations of credit risk. Southern Company Gas' exposure to concentrations of credit risk is discussed herein.Southern Company GasGas Distribution OperationsConcentration of credit risk occurs at Atlanta Gas Light for amounts billed for services and other costs to its customers, which consist of 16 Marketers in Georgia. The credit risk exposure to Marketers varies seasonally, with the lowest exposure in the non-peak summer months and the highest exposure in the peak winter months. Marketers are responsible for the retail sale of natural gas to end-use customers in Georgia. The provisions of Atlanta Gas Light's tariff allow Atlanta Gas Light to obtain credit security support in an amount equal to a minimum of two times a Marketer's highest month's estimated bill from Atlanta Gas Light. For 2019, the four largest Marketers based on customer count, which includes SouthStar, accounted for 21% of Southern Company Gas' adjusted operating margin and 27% of adjusted operating margin for Southern Company Gas' gas distribution operations segment.II-114 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2019 Annual ReportSeveral factors are designed to mitigate Southern Company Gas' risks from the increased concentration of credit that has resulted from deregulation. In addition to the security support described above, Atlanta Gas Light bills intrastate delivery service to Marketers in advance rather than in arrears. Atlanta Gas Light accepts credit support in the form of cash deposits, letters of credit/surety bonds from acceptable issuers, and corporate guarantees from investment-grade entities. Southern Company Gas reviews the adequacy of credit support coverage, credit rating profiles of credit support providers, and payment status of each Marketer. Southern Company Gas believes that adequate policies and procedures are in place to properly quantify, manage, and report on Atlanta Gas Light's credit risk exposure to Marketers.Atlanta Gas Light also faces potential credit risk in connection with assignments of interstate pipeline transportation and storage capacity to Marketers. Although Atlanta Gas Light assigns this capacity to Marketers, in the event that a Marketer fails to pay the interstate pipelines for the capacity, the interstate pipelines would likely seek repayment from Atlanta Gas Light.Wholesale Gas ServicesSouthern Company Gas has established credit policies to determine and monitor the creditworthiness of counterparties, as well as the quality of pledged collateral. Southern Company Gas also utilizes netting agreements whenever possible to mitigate exposure to counterparty credit risk. When Southern Company Gas is engaged in more than one outstanding derivative transaction with the same counterparty and also has a legally enforceable netting agreement with that counterparty, the ""net"" mark-to-market exposure represents the netting of the positive and negative exposures with that counterparty and a reasonable measure of Southern Company Gas' credit risk. Southern Company Gas also uses other netting agreements with certain counterparties with whom it conducts significant transactions. Netting agreements enable Southern Company Gas to net certain assets and liabilities by counterparty. Southern Company Gas also nets across product lines and against cash collateral, provided the netting and cash collateral agreements include such provisions.Southern Company Gas may require counterparties to pledge additional collateral when deemed necessary. Southern Company Gas conducts credit evaluations and obtains appropriate internal approvals for a counterparty's line of credit before any transaction with the counterparty is executed. In most cases, the counterparty must have an investment grade rating, which includes a minimum long-term debt rating of Baa3 from Moody's and BBB- from S&P. Generally, Southern Company Gas requires credit enhancements by way of a guaranty, cash deposit, or letter of credit for transaction counterparties that do not have investment grade ratings. Certain of Southern Company Gas' derivative instruments contain credit-risk-related or other contingent features that could increase the payments for collateral it posts in the normal course of business when its financial instruments are in net liability positions. At December 31, 2019, for agreements with such features, Southern Company Gas' derivative instruments with liability fair values were immaterial and Southern Company Gas had no collateral posted with derivatives counterparties to satisfy these arrangements.Southern Company Gas has a concentration of credit risk as measured by its 30-day receivable exposure plus forward exposure. At December 31, 2019, the top 20 counterparties of Southern Company Gas' wholesale gas services segment represented approximately 59%, or $218 million, of its total counterparty exposure and had a weighted average S&P equivalent credit rating of A-, all of which is consistent with the prior year. The S&P equivalent credit rating is determined by a process of converting the lower of the S&P or Moody's ratings to an internal rating ranging from 9 to 1, with 9 being equivalent to AAA/Aaa by S&P and Moody's, respectively, and 1 being D / Default by S&P and Moody's, respectively. A counterparty that does not have an external rating is assigned an internal rating based on the strength of the financial ratios of that counterparty. To arrive at the weighted average credit rating, each counterparty is assigned an internal ratio, which is multiplied by their credit exposure and summed for all counterparties. The sum is divided by the aggregate total counterparties' exposures, and this numeric value is then converted to a S&P equivalent.II-115 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2019 Annual ReportThe following table provides credit risk information related to Southern Company Gas' third-party natural gas contracts receivable and payable positions at December 31: Gross Receivables Gross Payables 2019 2018 2019 2018 (in millions) (in millions)Netting agreements in place: Counterparty is investment grade$238 $461 $127 $255Counterparty is non-investment grade1 5 43 95Counterparty has no external rating175 314 272 505No netting agreements in place: Counterparty is investment grade14 19 — 1Counterparty has no external rating— 2 — —Amount recorded in balance sheets$428 $801 $442 $856Gas Marketing ServicesSouthern Company Gas obtains credit scores for its firm residential and small commercial customers using a national credit reporting agency, enrolling only those customers that meet or exceed Southern Company Gas' credit threshold. Southern Company Gas considers potential interruptible and large commercial customers based on reviews of publicly available financial statements and commercially available credit reports. Prior to entering into a physical transaction, Southern Company Gas also assigns physical wholesale counterparties an internal credit rating and credit limit based on the counterparties' Moody's, S&P, and Fitch ratings, commercially available credit reports, and audited financial statements.Capital RequirementsTotal estimated capital expenditures for the Registrants through 2024 based on their current construction programs are as follows: 20202021202220232024 (in billions)Southern Company(a)(b)(c)(d)$8.7$7.3$6.8$6.8$6.2Alabama Power(b)2.11.81.81.81.6Georgia Power(c)4.13.43.02.82.7Mississippi Power0.30.20.20.30.2Southern Power(d)0.30.20.10.10.1Southern Company Gas1.81.61.61.71.6(a)Includes the Subsidiary Registrants, as well the other subsidiaries.(b)Includes amounts contingent upon approval by the Alabama PSC related to Alabama Power's September 6, 2019 CCN filing totaling $0.5 billion for 2020, $0.2 billion for 2021, $0.3 billion for 2022, and $0.1 billion for 2023.

See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – ""Environmental Matters"" herein for additional information. These amounts also include capital expenditures related to contractual purchase commitments for nuclear fuel (for Southern Company, Alabama Power, and Georgia Power) and capital expenditures covered under LTSAs.The traditional electric operating companies also anticipate costs associated with closure and monitoring of ash ponds and landfills in accordance with the CCR Rule and the related state rules, which are reflected in the applicable Registrants' ARO liabilities. Alabama Power's cost estimates are based on closure-in-place for all of its ash ponds. The cost estimates for Georgia II-116 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2019 Annual ReportPower and Mississippi Power are based on a combination of closure-in-place for some ash ponds and closure by removal for others. These anticipated costs are likely to change, and could change materially, as assumptions and details pertaining to closure are refined and compliance activities continue. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – ""Environmental Matters – Environmental Laws and Regulations – Coal Combustion Residuals"" herein and Note 6 to the financial statements for additional information.

These factors include: changes in business conditions; changes in load projections; changes in environmental laws and regulations; the outcome of any legal challenges to environmental rules; changes in electric generating plants, including unit retirements and replacements and adding or changing fuel sources at existing electric generating units, to meet regulatory requirements; changes in FERC rules and regulations; state regulatory agency approvals; changes in the expected environmental compliance program; changes in legislation; the cost and efficiency of construction labor, equipment, and materials; project scope and design changes; abnormal weather; delays in construction due to judicial or regulatory action; storm impacts; and the cost of capital. In addition, there can be no assurance that costs related to capital expenditures will be fully recovered. Additionally, Southern Power's planned expenditures for plant acquisitions may vary due to market opportunities and Southern Power's ability to execute its growth strategy. See Note 15 to the financial statements under ""Southern Power"" for additional information regarding Southern Power's plant acquisitions and construction projects.The construction program of Georgia Power also includes Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, which includes components based on new technology that only within the last few years began initial operation in the global nuclear industry at this scale and which may be subject to additional revised cost estimates during construction.

Also see Notes 13 and 14 to the financial statements in Item 8 herein.II-2 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISSouthern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2020 Annual ReportOVERVIEWBusiness ActivitiesSouthern Company is a holding company that owns all of the common stock of three traditional electric operating companies, as well as Southern Power and Southern Company Gas, and owns other direct and indirect subsidiaries. The primary businesses of the Southern Company system are electricity sales by the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power and the distribution of natural gas by Southern Company Gas. Southern Company's reportable segments are the sale of electricity by the traditional electric operating companies, the sale of electricity in the competitive wholesale market by Southern Power, and the sale of natural gas and other complementary products and services by Southern Company Gas. See Note 16 to the financial statements for additional information.•The traditional electric operating companies – Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and Mississippi Power – are vertically integrated utilities providing electric service to retail customers in three Southeastern states in addition to wholesale customers in the Southeast.•Southern Power develops, constructs, acquires, owns, and manages power generation assets, including renewable energy and battery energy storage projects, and sells electricity at market-based rates in the wholesale market. Southern Power continually seeks opportunities to execute its strategy to create value through various transactions including acquisitions, dispositions, and sales of partnership interests, development and construction of new generating facilities, and entry into PPAs primarily with investor-owned utilities, IPPs, municipalities, electric cooperatives, and other load-serving entities, as well as commercial and industrial customers. In general, Southern Power commits to the construction or acquisition of new generating capacity only after entering into or assuming long-term PPAs for the new facilities.•Southern Company Gas is an energy services holding company whose primary business is the distribution of natural gas. Southern Company Gas owns natural gas distribution utilities in four states – Illinois, Georgia, Virginia, and Tennessee – and is also involved in several other complementary businesses. Southern Company Gas manages its business through four reportable segments – gas distribution operations, gas pipeline investments, wholesale gas services, which includes Sequent, a natural gas asset optimization company, and gas marketing services, which includes SouthStar, a Marketer and provider of energy-related products and services to natural gas markets – and one non-reportable segment, all other. See Notes 7 and 16 to the financial statements for additional information.Many factors affect the opportunities, challenges, and risks of the Southern Company system's electric service and natural gas businesses. These factors include the ability to maintain constructive regulatory environments, to maintain and grow sales and customers, and to effectively manage and secure timely recovery of prudently-incurred costs. These costs include those related to projected long-term demand growth; stringent environmental standards, including CCR rules; safety; system reliability and resilience; fuel; natural gas; restoration following major storms; and capital expenditures, including constructing new electric generating plants and expanding and improving the electric transmission and electric and natural gas distribution systems.The traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities have various regulatory mechanisms that address cost recovery. Effectively operating pursuant to these regulatory mechanisms and appropriately balancing required costs and capital expenditures with customer prices will continue to challenge the Southern Company system for the foreseeable future. See Note 2 to the financial statements for additional information.Southern Power's future earnings will depend upon the parameters of the wholesale market and the efficient operation of its wholesale generating assets, as well as Southern Power's ability to execute its growth strategy and to develop and construct generating facilities. In addition, Southern Power's future earnings will depend upon the availability of federal and state ITCs and PTCs on its renewable energy projects, which could be impacted by future tax legislation. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – ""Income Tax Matters"" herein and Notes 10 and 15 to the financial statements for additional information.Southern Company's other business activities include providing energy solutions to electric utilities and their customers in the areas of distributed generation, energy storage and renewables, and energy efficiency. Other business activities also include investments in telecommunications, leveraged lease projects, and gas storage facilities. Management continues to evaluate the contribution of each of these activities to total shareholder return and may pursue acquisitions, dispositions, and other strategic ventures or investments accordingly.II-3 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2020 Annual ReportRecent DevelopmentsCOVID-19During March 2020, COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and has spread globally, including throughout the United States. The Southern Company system provides an essential service to its customers; therefore, it is critical that Southern Company system employees are able to continue to perform their essential duties safely and effectively. The Southern Company system has implemented applicable business continuity plans, including teleworking, canceling non-essential business travel, increasing cleaning frequency at business locations, implementing applicable safety and health guidelines issued by federal and state officials, and establishing protocols for required work on customer premises. To date, these procedures have been effective in maintaining the Southern Company system's critical operations. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, there have been economic disruptions in the Registrants' operating territories. The traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities temporarily suspended disconnections for non-payment by customers and waived late fees for certain periods. See Note 2 to the financial statements for information regarding deferral of certain incremental COVID-19-related costs, including bad debt, to a regulatory asset by certain of the traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted productivity and the pace of activity completion at Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, as discussed further herein. Additional information regarding the COVID-19 pandemic and its past and potential future impacts on the Registrants is provided throughout Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and in Item 1A herein.Alabama PowerOn August 14, 2020, the Alabama PSC issued an order granting Alabama Power a CCN to procure additional capacity, and, on August 31, 2020, Alabama Power completed its acquisition of the Central Alabama Generating Station.In October 2020, Alabama Power reduced its over-collected fuel balance by $94.3 million in accordance with an August 7, 2020 Alabama PSC order authorizing Alabama Power to reduce its over-collected fuel balance by $100 million and return that amount to customers in the form of bill credits, with any undistributed amount remaining in the regulatory liability for the benefit of customers.For the year ended December 31, 2020, Alabama Power's weighted common equity return exceeded 6.15%, resulting in Alabama Power establishing a current regulatory liability of $50 million for Rate RSE refunds, which will be refunded to customers through bill credits in April 2021.During 2020, Alabama Power recorded $51 million and $67 million against the NDR for damages incurred to its transmission and distribution facilities from Hurricane Sally and Hurricane Zeta, respectively. Alabama Power made an additional accrual of $100 million to the NDR in December 2020.Effective for the billing month of January 2021, Alabama Power's Rate RSE increased 4.09%, or approximately $228 million annually, and Alabama Power's Rate ECR decreased 1.84%, or approximately $103 million annually, as approved by the Alabama PSC.See Notes 2 and 15 to the financial statements under ""Alabama Power"" for additional information.Georgia PowerRate PlansOn December 15, 2020, in accordance with the terms of the 2019 ARP, the Georgia PSC approved tariff adjustments effective January 1, 2021 as follows: (i) increased traditional base tariffs by approximately $120 million; (ii) increased the Environmental Compliance Cost Recovery (ECCR) tariff by approximately $2 million; (iii) decreased Demand-Side Management tariffs by approximately $15 million; and (iv) increased Municipal Franchise Fee tariffs by approximately $4 million, for a total net increase in annual base revenues of approximately $111 million. Georgia Power expects to submit a compliance filing in the third quarter 2021 to request tariff adjustments approved pursuant to the 2019 ARP effective January 1, 2022. The amounts requested in the 2019 ARP were as follows: (i) increase traditional base tariffs by approximately $192 million; (ii) increase the ECCR tariff by approximately $184 million; (iii) increase Demand-Side Management tariffs by approximately $1 million; and (iv) increase Municipal Franchise Fee tariffs by approximately $9 million, for a total increase in annual base revenues of approximately $386 million. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time. See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Georgia Power – Rate Plans – 2019 ARP"" for additional information.II-4 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2020 Annual ReportPlant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 StatusConstruction continues on Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 (with electric generating capacity of approximately 1,100 MWs each), in which Georgia Power holds a 45.7% ownership interest. Georgia Power's share of the total project capital cost forecast is $8.7 billion, with expected in-service dates of November 2021 for Unit 3 and November 2022 for Unit 4.As of June 30, 2020, assignments of contingency to the base capital cost forecast exceeded the remaining balance of the construction contingency originally established in the second quarter 2018 and Georgia Power established $115 million of additional construction contingency. During the third and fourth quarters 2020, this construction contingency, plus an additional $5 million, was fully assigned to the base capital cost forecast. Assignment of contingency during 2020 addressed cost risks related to construction productivity, including the April 2020 reduction in workforce designed to mitigate impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic described below; other COVID-19 impacts; craft labor incentives; additional resources for supervision, field support, project management, initial test program, start-up, engineering support, and operations and maintenance support; subcontracts; and procurement, among other factors. These factors continue to represent further potential cost risk to the project; therefore, Georgia Power established $171 million of additional contingency as of December 31, 2020.After considering the significant level of uncertainty that exists regarding the future recoverability of these costs since the ultimate outcome of these matters is subject to the outcome of future assessments by management, as well as Georgia PSC decisions in future regulatory proceedings, Georgia Power recorded total pre-tax charges to income of $149 million ($111 million after tax) and $176 million ($131 million after tax) for the increases in the total project capital cost forecast as of June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2020, respectively. As and when these amounts are spent, Georgia Power may request the Georgia PSC to evaluate those expenditures for rate recovery.In mid-March 2020, Southern Nuclear began implementing policies and procedures designed to mitigate the risk of transmission of COVID-19 at the construction site. In April 2020, Georgia Power, acting for itself and as agent for the other Vogtle Owners, announced a reduction in workforce at Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 and began reducing the then-existing site workforce by approximately 20%. This workforce reduction lowered absenteeism, providing an improvement in operational efficiency and allowing for increased social distancing. Since April 2020, the number of active cases at the site has fluctuated and has continued to impact productivity levels and pace of activity completion.From November 2020 through January 2021, the number of active COVID-19 cases at the site increased significantly, consistent with a national rise in cases, and the project continued to face challenges. As a result, overall production levels were not achieved at the levels anticipated, contributing to the December 31, 2020 allocation of construction contingency and increase in total project capital cost forecast. Also, after considering these factors, Southern Nuclear has further extended certain milestone dates, including the start of hot functional testing and fuel load for Unit 3, from those established in October 2020. These updated milestone dates are expected to support the regulatory-approved in-service dates of November 2021 and November 2022 for Units 3 and 4, respectively. With minimal schedule margin remaining, the Unit 3 schedule is challenged, and any further extension of the hot functional testing or fuel load milestones, or other delays from the challenges described in Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Georgia Power – Nuclear Construction,"" could impact the ability to achieve the November 2021 in-service date.The continuing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic could further disrupt or delay construction and testing activities at Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Georgia Power's proportionate share of the estimated incremental cost associated with COVID-19 mitigation actions and impacts on construction productivity is currently estimated to be between $150 million and $190 million and is included in the total project capital cost. The ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and other factors on the construction schedule and budget for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 cannot be determined at this time.See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Georgia Power – Nuclear Construction"" for additional information.Mississippi PowerOn March 17, 2020, the Mississippi PSC approved a settlement agreement between Mississippi Power and the Mississippi Public Utilities Staff related to Mississippi Power's base rate case filed in November 2019 (Mississippi Power Rate Case Settlement Agreement). Under the terms of the Mississippi Power Rate Case Settlement Agreement, annual retail rates decreased approximately $16.7 million, or 1.85%, effective for the first billing cycle of April 2020.During 2020, Mississippi Power substantially completed mine reclamation activities at the Kemper County energy facility. On September 3, 2020, Mississippi Power and Southern Company executed an agreement with the DOE completing Mississippi Power's 2018 request for property closeout certification under the contract related to DOE grants received for the Kemper County energy facility, which enabled Mississippi Power to proceed with full dismantlement of the abandoned gasifier-related assets and II-5 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2020 Annual Reportsite restoration activities. These activities are expected to be completed by 2026. See Note 3 to the financial statements under ""Other Matters – Mississippi Power – Kemper County Energy Facility"" for additional information.On February 12, 2021, Mississippi Power submitted its 2021 ECO Plan filing to the Mississippi PSC, which requested an annual decrease in revenues of approximately $9 million, as well as its ad valorem tax adjustment filing for 2021, which requested an annual increase in revenues of approximately $28 million. Mississippi Power plans to submit its 2021 PEP filing in March 2021.On December 17, 2020, the Mississippi PSC issued an order concluding the RMP docket and requiring Mississippi Power to incorporate into its 2021 IRP a schedule of early or anticipated retirement of 950 MWs of fossil-steam generation by year-end 2027 to reduce Mississippi Power's excess reserve margin. Mississippi Power's IRP is scheduled to be filed in April 2021.See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Mississippi Power"" for additional information. The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.Southern PowerDuring 2020, Southern Power completed construction of and placed in service the 200-MW Reading and 136-MW Skookumchuck wind facilities, commenced construction of the 88-MW Garland and 72-MW Tranquillity battery energy storage facilities, and acquired and commenced construction of the 118-MW Glass Sands wind facility.In January 2020, Southern Power completed the sale of its equity interests in Plant Mankato (including the 385-MW expansion unit completed in May 2019) to a subsidiary of Xcel for a purchase price of approximately $663 million, including final working capital adjustments.In March 2020, Southern Power entered into an agreement to acquire a controlling membership interest in an approximately 300-MW wind facility located in South Dakota. The acquisition is subject to certain customary conditions to closing, including commercial operation of the facility, which is expected to occur in the first quarter 2021. Subsequent to the acquisition, Southern Power expects to complete a tax equity transaction. The facility's output is contracted under two long-term PPAs. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.In May 2020, Southern Power purchased a controlling interest in the 56-MW Beech Ridge II wind facility located in West Virginia from Invenergy Renewables LLC. The facility's output is contracted under a 12-year PPA.Southern Power calculates an investment coverage ratio for its generating assets, including those owned with various partners, based on the ratio of investment under contract to total investment using the respective generation facilities' net book value (or expected in-service value for facilities under construction) as the investment amount. With the inclusion of investments associated with the facilities currently under construction, as well as other capacity and energy contracts, Southern Power's average investment coverage ratio at December 31, 2020 was 94% through 2025 and 91% through 2030, with an average remaining contract duration of approximately 14 years.See Note 15 to the financial statements under ""Southern Power"" for additional information.Southern Company GasOn March 24, 2020, Southern Company Gas completed the sale of its interests in Pivotal LNG and Atlantic Coast Pipeline with aggregate proceeds of $178 million, including final working capital adjustments. On December 1, 2020, Southern Company Gas completed the sale of Jefferson Island for a purchase price of $33 million, including estimated working capital adjustments. See Note 15 to the financial statements under ""Southern Company Gas"" for additional information.On June 1, 2020, Virginia Natural Gas filed a general rate case with the Virginia Commission seeking an increase in annual base revenues of $49.6 million based on a ROE of 10.35% and an equity ratio of 54%.

These indicators include, but are not limited to, customer satisfaction, plant availability, electric and natural gas system reliability, and execution of major construction projects. In addition, Southern Company and the Subsidiary Registrants focus on earnings per share (EPS) and net income, respectively, as a key performance indicator. See RESULTS OF OPERATIONS herein for information on the Registrants' financial performance. See RESULTS OF OPERATIONS – ""Southern Company Gas – Operating Metrics"" for additional information on Southern Company Gas' operating metrics, including Heating Degree Days, customer count, and volumes of natural gas sold.The financial success of the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Company Gas is directly tied to customer satisfaction. Key elements of ensuring customer satisfaction include outstanding service, high reliability, and competitive prices. The traditional electric operating companies use customer satisfaction surveys to evaluate their results and generally target the top quartile of these surveys in measuring performance. Reliability indicators are also used to evaluate results. See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Alabama Power – Rate RSE"" and "" – Mississippi Power – Performance Evaluation Plan"" for additional information on Alabama Power's Rate RSE and Mississippi Power's PEP rate plan, respectively, both of which contain mechanisms that directly tie customer service indicators to the allowed equity return.Southern Power continues to focus on several key performance indicators, including, but not limited to, the equivalent forced outage rate and contract availability to evaluate operating results and help ensure its ability to meet its contractual commitments to customers.RESULTS OF OPERATIONSSouthern CompanyConsolidated net income attributable to Southern Company was $3.1 billion in 2020, a decrease of $1.6 billion, or 34.2%, from the prior year. The decrease was primarily due to the $2.6 billion ($1.4 billion after tax) gain on the sale of Gulf Power in 2019 and after-tax charges totaling $242 million in 2020 related to Georgia Power's construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. See Notes 2 and 15 to the financial statements under ""Georgia Power – Nuclear Construction"" and ""Southern Company,"" respectively, for additional information.Basic EPS was $2.95 in 2020 and $4.53 in 2019. Diluted EPS, which factors in additional shares related to stock-based compensation, was $2.93 in 2020 and $4.50 in 2019. EPS for 2020 and 2019 was negatively impacted by $0.03 and $0.11 per share, respectively, as a result of increases in the average shares outstanding. See Note 8 to the financial statements under ""Outstanding Classes of Capital Stock – Southern Company"" for additional information.Dividends paid per share of common stock were $2.54 in 2020 and $2.46 in 2019. In January 2021, Southern Company declared a quarterly dividend of 64 cents per share. For 2020, the dividend payout ratio was 86% compared to 54% for 2019. The increase was due to the decrease in earnings in 2020.Discussion of Southern Company's results of operations is divided into three parts – the Southern Company system's primary business of electricity sales, its gas business, and its other business activities.20202019(in millions)Electricity business$3,115 $3,268 Gas business590 585 Other business activities(586)886 Net Income$3,119 $4,739 II-7 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2020 Annual ReportElectricity BusinessSouthern Company's electric utilities generate and sell electricity to retail and wholesale customers.

Details of electric operating revenues were as follows: 20202019 (in millions)Retail electric — prior year$14,084 Estimated change resulting from —Rates and pricing484 Sales decline(132)Weather(288)Fuel and other cost recovery(505)Retail electric — current year$13,643 $14,084 Wholesale electric revenues1,945 2,152 Other electric revenues672 636 Other revenues237 223 Electric operating revenues$16,497 $17,095 Percent change(3.5)%(7.9)%Retail electric revenues decreased $441 million, or 3.1%, in 2020 as compared to the prior year. The significant factors driving this change are shown in the preceding table. The increase in rates and pricing in 2020 was primarily due to Georgia Power's recovery of environmental compliance costs and the impacts of accruals for customer refunds in 2019 related to the Tax Reform Legislation and earnings in excess of the allowed retail ROE range as well as the rate pricing effects of decreased customer usage throughout 2020. The increase was also due to customer bill credits at Alabama Power in 2019 related to the Tax Reform Legislation. These increases were partially offset by lower contributions from commercial and industrial customers with variable demand-driven pricing at Georgia Power.Electric rates for the traditional electric operating companies include provisions to adjust billings for fluctuations in fuel costs, including the energy component of purchased power costs. Under these provisions, fuel revenues generally equal fuel expenses, including the energy component of PPA costs, and do not affect net income. The traditional electric operating companies each have one or more regulatory mechanisms to recover other costs such as environmental and other compliance costs, storm damage, new plants, and PPA capacity costs.See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Alabama Power"" and ""Georgia Power"" for additional information. Also see ""Energy Sales"" herein for a discussion of changes in the volume of energy sold, including changes related to sales growth (decline) and weather.Wholesale electric revenues consist of PPAs and short-term opportunity sales. Wholesale electric revenues from PPAs (other than solar and wind PPAs) have both capacity and energy components. Capacity revenues generally represent the greatest contribution to net income and are designed to provide recovery of fixed costs plus a return on investment. Energy revenues will vary depending on fuel prices, the market prices of wholesale energy compared to the Southern Company system's generation, demand for energy within the Southern Company system's electric service territory, and the availability of the Southern Company system's generation. Increases and decreases in energy revenues that are driven by fuel prices are accompanied by an increase or decrease in fuel costs and do not have a significant impact on net income. Energy sales from solar and wind PPAs do not have a capacity charge and customers either purchase the energy output of a dedicated renewable facility through an energy charge or through a fixed price related to the energy. As a result, the ability to recover fixed and variable operations and maintenance expenses is dependent upon the level of energy generated from these facilities, which can be impacted by weather conditions, equipment performance, transmission constraints, and other factors. Wholesale electric revenues at Mississippi Power include FERC-regulated MRA sales as well as market-based sales. Short-term opportunity sales are made at market-based rates that generally provide a margin above the Southern Company system's variable cost to produce the energy.II-9 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2020 Annual ReportWholesale electric revenues from power sales were as follows:20202019 (in millions)Capacity and other$476 $529 Energy1,469 1,623Total$1,945 $2,152 In 2020, wholesale electric revenues decreased $207 million, or 9.6%, as compared to the prior year due to decreases of $154 million in energy revenues and $53 million in capacity revenues. Energy revenues decreased $98 million at Southern Power and $56 million at the traditional electric operating companies. The decrease at Southern Power primarily resulted from a net decrease in the volume of KWHs sold due to decreased demand and lower natural gas prices, partially offset by increases in sales from solar facilities, wind facilities, and fuel cell generation. The decrease at the traditional electric operating companies was primarily due to lower energy prices. The decrease in capacity revenues was primarily related to the sales of Southern Power's Plant Mankato in the first quarter 2020 and Southern Power's Plant Nacogdoches in the second quarter 2019. See Note 15 to the financial statements for additional information.Other Electric RevenuesOther electric revenues increased $36 million, or 5.7%, in 2020 as compared to the prior year. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $23 million in transmission revenues, an increase of $15 million from outdoor lighting at Georgia Power, and an increase of $10 million in energy service revenues at Alabama Power, as well as an increase of $6 million from pole attachment agreements at Alabama Power and Georgia Power. These increases were partially offset by a reduction of $26 million largely resulting from the temporary suspension of customer disconnections and late fees related to the COVID-19 pandemic.Energy SalesChanges in revenues are influenced heavily by the change in the volume of energy sold from year to year. KWH sales for 2020 and the percent change from the prior year were as follows:2020TotalKWHsTotal KWHPercent ChangeWeather-AdjustedPercent Change(*)(in billions)Residential47.4 (2.2)%3.1 %Commercial45.4 (7.5)(5.7)Industrial47.0 (6.2)(6.2)Other0.7 (9.5)(9.3)Total retail140.5 (5.3)(3.0)%Wholesale45.7 (4.9)Total energy sales186.2 (5.2)%(*)Weather-adjusted KWH sales are estimated by removing from KWH sales the effect of deviations from normal temperature conditions, based on statistical models of the historical relationship between temperatures and energy sales. Normal temperature conditions are defined as those experienced in the applicable service territory over a specified historical period. This metric is useful because it allows trends in historical operations to be evaluated apart from the influence of weather conditions. Management also considers this metric in developing long-term capital and financial plans.Changes in retail energy sales are generally the result of changes in electricity usage by customers, weather, and the number of customers. Weather-adjusted retail energy sales decreased 4.4 billion KWHs in 2020 as compared to the prior year largely due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Weather-adjusted residential usage increases are primarily due to customer growth and an increase in average customer usage, primarily due to work-from-home policies. Weather-adjusted commercial usage decreases are primarily due to lower customer usage resulting from changes in consumer and business behavior in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Industrial usage decreases are primarily a result of disruptions in supply chain and business operations related to the COVID-19 pandemic and the overall decrease in business activity due to the resulting recession.See ""Electric Operating Revenues"" above for a discussion of significant changes in wholesale revenues related to changes in price and KWH sales.II-10 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2020 Annual ReportOther RevenuesOther revenues increased $14 million, or 6.3%, in 2020 as compared to the prior year. The increase was primarily due to increases in unregulated sales of products and services of $9 million at Georgia Power and $5 million at Alabama Power.Fuel and Purchased Power ExpensesThe mix of fuel sources for the generation of electricity is determined primarily by demand, the unit cost of fuel consumed, and the availability of generating units. Additionally, the electric utilities purchase a portion of their electricity needs from the wholesale market.Details of the Southern Company system's generation and purchased power were as follows:20202019Total generation (in billions of KWHs)176 187 Total purchased power (in billions of KWHs)18 18 Sources of generation (percent) —Gas53 52 Coal18 22 Nuclear17 16 Hydro4 3 Wind, Solar, and Other8 7 Cost of fuel, generated (in cents per net KWH) —Gas2.00 2.36 Coal2.91 2.87 Nuclear0.78 0.79 Average cost of fuel, generated (in cents per net KWH)1.95 2.20 Average cost of purchased power (in cents per net KWH)(*)4.65 4.66 (*)Average cost of purchased power includes fuel purchased by the Southern Company system for tolling agreements where power is generated by the provider.In 2020, total fuel and purchased power expenses were $3.8 billion, a decrease of $672 million, or 15.1%, as compared to the prior year. The decrease was primarily the result of a $363 million decrease in the volume of KWHs generated and purchased and a $309 million decrease primarily in the average cost of fuel.Fuel and purchased power energy transactions at the traditional electric operating companies are generally offset by fuel revenues and do not have a significant impact on net income. See Note 2 to the financial statements for additional information. Fuel expenses incurred under Southern Power's PPAs are generally the responsibility of the counterparties and do not significantly impact net income.FuelIn 2020, fuel expense was $3.0 billion, a decrease of $655 million, or 18.1%, as compared to the prior year. The decrease was primarily due to a 23.9% decrease in the volume of KWHs generated by coal, a 15.3% decrease in the average cost of natural gas per KWH generated, and a 2.5% decrease in the volume of KWHs generated by natural gas, partially offset by a 1.4% increase in the average cost of coal per KWH generated.Purchased PowerIn 2020, purchased power expense was $799 million, a decrease of $17 million, or 2.1%, as compared to the prior year. The decrease was primarily due to a 2.7% decrease in the volume of KWHs purchased.Energy purchases will vary depending on demand for energy within the Southern Company system's electric service territory, the market prices of wholesale energy as compared to the cost of the Southern Company system's generation, and the availability of the Southern Company system's generation.II-11 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2020 Annual ReportOther Operations and Maintenance ExpensesOther operations and maintenance expenses decreased $253 million, or 5.6%, in 2020 as compared to the prior year. The decrease reflects the impacts of cost containment activities implemented in 2020 to help offset the effects of the recessionary economy resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. The decrease primarily results from decreases of $195 million in transmission and distribution expenses at the traditional electric operating companies, including $37 million of increases in reliability NDR credits at Alabama Power, $180 million in scheduled generation outage and maintenance expenses, and $32 million in compliance and environmental expenses at the traditional electric operating companies, partially offset by a $183 million increase in storm damage recovery at Georgia Power as authorized in the 2019 ARP and a $45 million increase in employee compensation and benefit expenses. The decrease also reflects a $32 million increase in nuclear property insurance refunds at Alabama Power and Georgia Power. See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Alabama Power – Rate NDR"" and ""Georgia Power – Storm Damage Recovery"" for additional information.Depreciation and AmortizationDepreciation and amortization increased $469 million, or 19.0%, in 2020 as compared to the prior year. The increase was due to increased amortization of regulatory assets related to CCR AROs of $203 million and higher depreciation of $178 million as authorized in Georgia Power's 2019 ARP, as well as an increase of $104 million in depreciation associated with additional plant in service. See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Georgia Power – Rate Plans"" for additional information.Estimated Loss on Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4In the second and fourth quarters 2020, estimated probable losses of $149 million and $176 million, respectively, were recorded to reflect Georgia Power's revised total project capital cost forecast to complete construction and start-up of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Georgia Power – Nuclear Construction"" for additional information.(Gain) Loss on Dispositions, NetGain on dispositions, net increased $21 million in 2020 as compared to the prior year primarily related to the sale of Plant Mankato in the first quarter 2020 and the sale of Plant Nacogdoches in the second quarter 2019. See Note 15 to the financial statements under ""Southern Power – Sales of Natural Gas and Biomass Plants"" for additional information.Allowance for Equity Funds Used During ConstructionAllowance for equity funds used during construction increased $17 million, or 14.0%, in 2020 as compared to the prior year primarily associated with the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 at Georgia Power. See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Georgia Power – Nuclear Construction – Regulatory Matters"" for additional information.Other Income (Expense), NetOther income (expense), net increased $81 million, or 34.6%, in 2020 as compared to the prior year primarily related to a $131 million increase in non-service cost-related retirement benefits income, partially offset by a $24 million net decrease associated with a 2019 litigation settlement at Southern Power and a $21 million increase in charitable donations, primarily at Georgia Power. See Note 11 to the financial statements for additional information.Income TaxesIncome taxes decreased $191 million, or 27.0%, in 2020 as compared to the prior year. The decrease was primarily due to $208 million of flowback of excess deferred income taxes in 2020 as authorized in Georgia Power's 2019 ARP and a $90 million decrease associated with lower pre-tax earnings, primarily from charges associated with the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 at Georgia Power, partially offset by a $75 million income tax benefit in 2019 resulting from ITCs recognized upon the sale of Plant Nacogdoches and a $24 million net increase related to the application of an accounting order associated with the Tax Reform Legislation in the prior year at Alabama Power. See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Georgia Power – Rate Plans"" and – ""Nuclear Construction"" for additional information.Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Noncontrolling InterestsSubstantially all noncontrolling interests relate to renewable projects at Southern Power. Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests increased $21 million in 2020 as compared to the prior year. The increased loss was primarily due to an allocation to the noncontrolling interest partner of approximately $26 million of income related to a litigation settlement at Southern Power in 2019.II-12 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2020 Annual ReportGas BusinessSouthern Company Gas distributes natural gas through utilities in four states and is involved in several other complementary businesses including gas pipeline investments, wholesale gas services, and gas marketing services.A condensed statement of income for the gas business follows: 2020Increase (Decrease) from 2019 (in millions)Operating revenues$3,434 $(358)Cost of natural gas972 (347)Other operations and maintenance966 78 Depreciation and amortization500 13 Taxes other than income taxes206 (7)Impairment charges— (115)(Gain) loss on dispositions, net(22)(22)Total operating expenses2,622 (400)Operating income812 42 Earnings from equity method investments141 (16)Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized231 (1)Other income (expense), net41 21 Income taxes173 43 Net income$590 $5 Seasonality of ResultsDuring the period from November through March when natural gas usage and operating revenues are generally higher (Heating Season), more customers are connected to Southern Company Gas' distribution systems and natural gas usage is higher in periods of colder weather. Occasionally in the summer, operating revenues are impacted due to peak usage by power generators in response to summer energy demands. Southern Company Gas' base operating expenses, excluding cost of natural gas, bad debt expense, and certain incentive compensation costs, are incurred relatively equally over any given year. Thus, operating results can vary significantly from quarter to quarter as a result of seasonality. For 2020, the percentage of operating revenues and net income generated during the Heating Season (January through March and November through December) were 67.6% and 85.6%, respectively. For 2019, the percentage of operating revenues and net income generated during the Heating Season were 68.7% and 86.8%, respectively.II-13 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2020 Annual ReportOperating RevenuesOperating revenues in 2020 were $3.4 billion, a $358 million decrease compared to 2019. Details of operating revenues were as follows:2020(in millions)Operating revenues – prior year$3,792 Estimated change resulting from –Infrastructure replacement programs and base rate changes186 Gas costs and other cost recovery(319)Wholesale gas services(220)Other(5)Operating revenues – current year$3,434 Percent change(9.4)%Revenues at the natural gas distribution utilities increased in 2020 compared to the prior year due to base rate increases and continued investments recovered through infrastructure replacement programs, including increases of $107 million at Nicor Gas and $68 million at Atlanta Gas Light. See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Southern Company Gas"" for additional information.Revenues associated with gas costs and other cost recovery decreased in 2020 compared to the prior year primarily due to lower natural gas prices and lower sales volumes as a result of warmer weather. The natural gas distribution utilities have weather or revenue normalization mechanisms that mitigate revenue fluctuations from customer consumption changes. Natural gas distribution rates include provisions to adjust billings for fluctuations in natural gas costs. Therefore, gas costs recovered through natural gas revenues generally equal the amount expensed in cost of natural gas and do not affect net income from the natural gas distribution utilities. See ""Cost of Natural Gas"" herein for additional information.Revenues from wholesale gas services decreased in 2020 primarily due to lower derivative gains and decreased commercial activity as a result of warmer weather.Southern Company Gas hedged its exposure to warmer-than-normal weather in Illinois for gas distribution operations and in Illinois and Georgia for gas marketing services. The remaining impacts of weather on earnings were immaterial.Cost of Natural GasExcluding Atlanta Gas Light, which does not sell natural gas to end-use customers, the natural gas distribution utilities charge their utility customers for natural gas consumed using natural gas cost recovery mechanisms set by the applicable state regulatory agencies. Under these mechanisms, all prudently-incurred natural gas costs are passed through to customers without markup, subject to regulatory review. The natural gas distribution utilities defer or accrue the difference between the actual cost of natural gas and the amount of commodity revenue earned in a given period. The deferred or accrued amount is either billed or refunded to customers prospectively through adjustments to the commodity rate. Deferred natural gas costs are reflected as regulatory assets and accrued natural gas costs are reflected as regulatory liabilities. Therefore, gas costs recovered through natural gas revenues generally equal the amount expensed in cost of natural gas and do not affect net income from the natural gas distribution utilities. Cost of natural gas at the natural gas distribution utilities represented 88.3% of the total cost of natural gas for 2020.Gas marketing services customers are charged for actual and estimated natural gas consumed. Cost of natural gas includes the cost of fuel and associated transportation costs, lost and unaccounted for gas, adjustments to reduce the value of inventories to market value, if applicable, and gains and losses associated with certain derivatives.Cost of natural gas was $1.0 billion, a decrease of $347 million, or 26.3%, in 2020 compared to the prior year, which reflects a 23.6% decrease in natural gas prices compared to 2019 and decreased volumes primarily as a result of warmer weather.Other Operations and Maintenance ExpensesOther operations and maintenance expenses increased $78 million, or 8.8%, in 2020 compared to the prior year. The increase was primarily due to increases of $40 million in compensation and benefit expenses, $10 million in charitable donations, $12 million II-14 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2020 Annual Reportin pipeline repair, compliance, and maintenance activities, and $19 million in expenses passed through directly to customers primarily related to bad debt.Depreciation and AmortizationDepreciation and amortization increased $13 million, or 2.7%, in 2020 compared to the prior year. This increase was primarily due to continued infrastructure investments at the natural gas distribution utilities. See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Southern Company Gas – Infrastructure Replacement Programs and Capital Projects"" for additional information.Impairment ChargesIn 2019, Southern Company Gas recorded impairment charges of $91 million related to Jefferson Island and $24 million in contemplation of the sale of its interests in Pivotal LNG and Atlantic Coast Pipeline. See Notes 3 and 15 to the financial statements under ""Other Matters – Southern Company Gas"" and ""Southern Company Gas,"" respectively, for additional information.(Gain) Loss on Dispositions, NetIn 2020, gain on dispositions, net was $22 million resulting from the sale of Jefferson Island. See Note 15 to the financial statements under ""Southern Company Gas"" for additional information.Earnings from Equity Method InvestmentsEarnings from equity method investments decreased $16 million, or 10.2%, in 2020 compared to the prior year. This decrease was primarily due to a $12 million decrease in earnings from SNG as a result of lower demand and firm revenues and a $9 million decrease in earnings as a result of the sale of Atlantic Coast Pipeline in the first quarter 2020, partially offset by a $6 million pre-tax loss on the sale of Triton in May 2019. See Notes 7 and 15 to the financial statements under ""Southern Company Gas"" for additional information.Other Income (Expense), NetOther income (expense), net increased $21 million in 2020 compared to the prior year. This increase primarily resulted from an increase in non-service cost-related retirement benefits income. See Note 11 to the financial statements for additional information.Income TaxesIncome taxes increased $43 million, or 33.1%, in 2020 compared to the prior year. This increase was primarily due to the reversal of a federal income tax valuation allowance in connection with the sale of Triton in 2019, a decrease in the flowback of excess deferred income taxes in 2020 at Atlanta Gas Light as previously authorized by the Georgia PSC, and higher pre-tax earnings. See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Southern Company Gas,"" Note 10 to the financial statements, and Note 15 to the financial statements under ""Southern Company Gas"" for additional information.Other Business ActivitiesSouthern Company's other business activities primarily include the parent company (which does not allocate operating expenses to business units); PowerSecure, a provider of energy solutions to electric utilities and their customers in the areas of distributed generation, energy storage and renewables, and energy efficiency; Southern Holdings, which invests in various projects, including leveraged lease projects; and Southern Linc, which provides digital wireless communications for use by the Southern Company system and also markets these services to the public and provides fiber optics services within the Southeast.II-15 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2020 Annual ReportA condensed statement of income for Southern Company's other business activities follows:2020Increase (Decrease) from 2019(in millions)Operating revenues$444 $(88)Cost of other sales234 (125)Other operations and maintenance196 (35)Depreciation and amortization77 (3)Taxes other than income taxes4 (2)Impairment charges— (50)(Gain) loss on dispositions, net(1)2,547 Total operating expenses510 2,332 Operating income (loss)(66)(2,420)Interest expense614 97 Impairment of leveraged leases206 206 Other income (expense), net3 (6)Income taxes (benefit)(297)(1,257)Net income (loss)$(586)$(1,472)Operating RevenuesSouthern Company's operating revenues for these other business activities decreased $88 million, or 16.5%, in 2020 as compared to the prior year primarily from the sales of PowerSecure's utility infrastructure services business in July 2019 and its lighting business in December 2019, as well as the wind-down of a segment of PowerSecure's distributed infrastructure business in the first quarter 2020. These decreases were partially offset by PowerSecure's continued growth in the core distributed infrastructure business and an increase at Southern Linc related to a contract for the design and construction of a fiber optic system. See Note 15 to the financial statements under ""Southern Company"" for additional information.Cost of Other SalesCost of other sales for these other business activities decreased $125 million, or 34.8%, in 2020 as compared to the prior year primarily from the sales of PowerSecure's utility infrastructure services business in July 2019 and its lighting business in December 2019, as well as the wind-down of a segment of PowerSecure's distributed infrastructure business in the first quarter 2020. These decreases were partially offset by PowerSecure's continued growth in the core distributed infrastructure business. See Note 15 to the financial statements under ""Southern Company"" for additional information.Other Operations and Maintenance ExpensesOther operations and maintenance expenses for these other business activities decreased $35 million, or 15.2%, in 2020 as compared to the prior year. The decrease was primarily due to the sales of PowerSecure's utility infrastructure services business in July 2019 and its lighting business in December 2019, partially offset by an increase at Southern Linc related to the design and construction of a fiber optic system. See Note 15 to the financial statements under ""Southern Company"" for additional information.Impairment ChargesIn 2019, goodwill and asset impairment charges totaling $50 million were recorded related to the sale of PowerSecure's utility infrastructure services business and in contemplation of the sale of its lighting business.

These revenues decreased $288 million, or 5.2%, in 2020 as compared to the prior year. The decrease in 2020 was primarily due to fuel and other cost recovery driven by decreases in generation and the average cost of fuel, milder weather in 2020 when compared to 2019, and a decline in commercial and industrial sales due to social distancing and safer-at-home guidelines related to the COVID-19 pandemic. These decreases were partially offset by customer bill credits issued in 2019 related to the Tax Reform Legislation and an increase in Rate CNP Compliance revenue in 2020.See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Alabama Power – Rate RSE"" and "" – Rate CNP Compliance"" for additional information. See ""Energy Sales"" herein for a discussion of changes in the volume of energy sold, including changes related to sales decline and weather. Electric rates include provisions to recognize the recovery of fuel costs, purchased power costs, PPAs certificated by the Alabama PSC, and costs associated with the NDR. Under these provisions, fuel and other cost recovery revenues generally equal fuel and other cost recovery expenses and do not affect net income. See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Alabama Power – Rate ECR"" for additional information.Wholesale revenues from power sales to non-affiliated utilities were as follows:20202019(in millions)Capacity and other$127 $102 Energy142 156 Total non-affiliated$269 $258 Wholesale revenues from sales to non-affiliates will vary depending on fuel prices, the market prices of wholesale energy compared to the cost of Alabama Power's and the Southern Company system's generation, demand for energy within the Southern Company system's electric service territory, and availability of the Southern Company system's generation. Increases and decreases in energy revenues that are driven by fuel prices are accompanied by an increase or decrease in fuel costs and do not affect net income. Short-term opportunity energy sales are also included in wholesale energy sales to non-affiliates. These opportunity sales are made at market-based rates that generally provide a margin above Alabama Power's variable cost to produce the energy.In 2020, wholesale revenues from sales to non-affiliates increased $11 million, or 4.3%, as compared to the prior year primarily due to a $25 million increase in non-affiliated capacity revenues as a result of a new power sales agreement which began in II-18 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2020 Annual ReportSeptember 2020, partially offset by a 17% decrease in the price of energy due to lower natural gas prices. See Notes 2 and 15 to the financial statements under ""Alabama Power – Petition for Certificate of Convenience and Necessity"" and ""Alabama Power,"" respectively, for additional information.Wholesale revenues from sales to affiliated companies will vary depending on demand and the availability and cost of generating resources at each company. These affiliate sales and purchases are made in accordance with the IIC, as approved by the FERC. These transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings since this energy is generally sold at marginal cost and energy purchases are generally offset by energy revenues through Alabama Power's energy cost recovery clause.In 2020, wholesale revenues from sales to affiliates decreased $35 million, or 43.2%, as compared to the prior year. In 2020, KWH sales decreased 30% due to decreased generation related to lower demand and the price of energy decreased 18.4% as a result of lower natural gas prices.In 2020, other operating revenues increased $17 million, or 6.0%, as compared to the prior year primarily due to increases in transmission and energy service revenues and unregulated sales of products and services, partially offset by decreased revenues resulting from the temporary suspension of customer disconnections and late fees related to the COVID-19 pandemic.Energy SalesChanges in revenues are influenced heavily by the change in the volume of energy sold from year to year.

Revenues attributable to changes in sales decreased in 2020 when compared to 2019 largely due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2020, weather-adjusted residential KWH sales were 2.7% higher compared to 2019 primarily due to COVID-19 pandemic impacts. Weather-adjusted commercial KWH sales decreased 6.3% primarily due to lower customer usage resulting from social distancing and safer-at-home guidelines related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Industrial KWH sales decreased 8.0% primarily as a result of disruptions in supply chain and business operations related to the COVID-19 pandemic.See ""Operating Revenues"" above for a discussion of significant changes in wholesale revenues from sales to non-affiliates and wholesale revenues from sales to affiliated companies related to changes in price and KWH sales.Fuel and Purchased Power ExpensesThe mix of fuel sources for generation of electricity is determined primarily by the unit cost of fuel consumed, demand, and the availability of generating units. Additionally, Alabama Power purchases a portion of its electricity needs from the wholesale market.II-19 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2020 Annual ReportDetails of Alabama Power's generation and purchased power were as follows:20202019Total generation (in billions of KWHs)55.256.9 Total purchased power (in billions of KWHs)6.99.5 Sources of generation (percent) —Coal39 45 Nuclear27 25 Gas24 21 Hydro10 9 Cost of fuel, generated (in cents per net KWH) —Coal2.74 2.69 Nuclear0.75 0.77 Gas1.90 2.47 Average cost of fuel, generated (in cents per net KWH)(a)1.92 2.11 Average cost of purchased power (in cents per net KWH)(b)4.82 4.39 (a)KWHs generated by hydro are excluded from the average cost of fuel, generated.(b)Average cost of purchased power includes fuel, energy, and transmission purchased by Alabama Power for tolling agreements where power is generated by the provider.Fuel and purchased power expenses were $1.3 billion in 2020, a decrease of $226 million, or 14.9%, compared to 2019. The decrease was primarily due to a $189 million decrease related to the volume of KWHs purchased and generated and a $37 million net decrease in the average cost of fuel and purchased power.Fuel and purchased power energy transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings, since energy expenses are generally offset by energy revenues through Alabama Power's energy cost recovery clause. Alabama Power, along with the Alabama PSC, continuously monitors the under/over recovered balance to determine whether adjustments to billing rates are required. See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Alabama Power – Rate ECR"" for additional information.FuelFuel expenses were $970 million in 2020, a decrease of $142 million, or 12.8%, compared to 2019. The decrease was primarily due to a 23.1% decrease in the average cost of KWHs generated by natural gas, which excludes tolling agreements, a 15.6% decrease in the volume of KWHs generated by coal, and a 14.2% increase in the volume of KWHs generated by hydro.Purchased Power – Non-AffiliatesPurchased power expense from non-affiliates was $191 million in 2020, a decrease of $12 million, or 5.9%, compared to 2019. This decrease was primarily due to a 6.4% decrease in the amount of energy purchased as a result of milder weather during 2020 as compared to 2019, partially offset by a 1.9% increase in the average cost per KWH purchased due to decreased generation from PPAs.Energy purchases from non-affiliates will vary depending on the market prices of wholesale energy as compared to the cost of the Southern Company system's generation, demand for energy within the Southern Company system's service territory, and the availability of the Southern Company system's generation.Purchased Power – AffiliatesPurchased power expense from affiliates was $128 million in 2020, a decrease of $72 million, or 36.0%, compared to 2019. This decrease was primarily due to a 41.9% decrease in the amount of energy purchased primarily related to milder weather during 2020 as compared to 2019. This decrease was partially offset by a 10.3% increase in the average cost per KWH purchased due to decreased generation from PPAs.Energy purchases from affiliates will vary depending on demand for energy and the availability and cost of generating resources at each company within the Southern Company system. These purchases are made in accordance with the IIC or other contractual agreements, as approved by the FERC.II-20 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2020 Annual ReportOther Operations and Maintenance ExpensesIn 2020, other operations and maintenance expenses decreased $202 million, or 11.1%, as compared to the prior year. The decrease reflects the impact of cost containment activities implemented to help offset the effects of the recessionary economy resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. The decrease was primarily due to decreases of $88 million in generation expenses, $27 million in vegetation management costs, $27 million in accruals to the NDR, and $20 million in Rate CNP Compliance-related expenses, as well as a $37 million increase in reliability NDR credits. See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Alabama Power – Rate NDR"" and "" – Rate CNP Compliance"" for additional information.Other Income (Expense), NetOther income (expense), net increased $54 million, or 117.4%, in 2020 as compared to the prior year primarily due to an increase in non-service cost-related retirements benefits income. See Note 11 to the financial statements for additional information.Income Taxes Income taxes increased $67 million, or 24.8%, in 2020 as compared to the prior year primarily due to an increase in pre-tax net income and the application in 2019 of an Alabama PSC accounting order related to the Tax Reform Legislation. See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Alabama Power – Tax Reform Accounting Order"" for additional information.Georgia PowerGeorgia Power's 2020 net income was $1.6 billion, representing a $145 million, or 8.4%, decrease from the previous year. The decrease was primarily due to after-tax charges totaling $242 million in 2020 related to the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, as well as lower retail revenues associated with milder weather as compared to 2019 and decreased customer usage resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by related cost containment activities and the impacts of accruals in 2019 for customer refunds.

The significant factors driving this change are shown in the preceding table. The increase in rates and pricing was primarily due to an increase in revenue recognized under the ECCR tariff effective January 1, 2020 as authorized in the 2019 ARP and the impacts of accruals in 2019 for customer refunds related to the Tax Reform Legislation and earnings in excess of the allowed retail ROE range, as well as the rate pricing effects of decreased customer usage throughout 2020 in the commercial and industrial classes. Partially offsetting these increases were lower contributions from commercial and industrial customers with variable demand-driven pricing. See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Georgia Power – Rate Plans"" for additional information.See ""Energy Sales"" below for a discussion of changes in the volume of energy sold, including changes related to the sales decline in 2020.Electric rates include provisions to adjust billings for fluctuations in fuel costs, including the energy component of purchased power costs.

See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Mississippi Power – Fuel Cost Recovery"" for additional information.Wholesale revenues from power sales to non-affiliated utilities, including FERC-regulated MRA sales as well as market-based sales, were as follows:20202019(in millions)Capacity and other$3 $3 Energy212 234 Total non-affiliated$215 $237 Wholesale revenues from sales to non-affiliates will vary depending on fuel prices, the market prices of wholesale energy compared to the cost of Mississippi Power's and the Southern Company system's generation, demand for energy within the Southern Company system's electric service territory, and the availability of the Southern Company system's generation. Increases and decreases in energy revenues that are driven by fuel prices are accompanied by an increase or decrease in fuel costs and do not have a significant impact on net income. In addition, Mississippi Power provides service under long-term contracts with rural electric cooperative associations and a municipality located in southeastern Mississippi under full requirements cost-based electric tariffs which are subject to regulation by the FERC. The contracts with these wholesale customers represented 15.3% of Mississippi Power's total operating revenues in 2020 and are generally subject to 10-year rolling cancellation notices. Historically, these wholesale customers have acted as a group and any changes in contractual relationships for one customer are likely to be followed by the other wholesale customers. Short-term opportunity energy sales are also included in sales for resale to non-affiliates. These opportunity sales are made at market-based rates that generally provide a margin above Mississippi Power's variable cost to produce the energy.Wholesale revenues from sales to non-affiliates decreased $22 million, or 9.3%, compared to 2019. This decrease was primarily due to decreases in revenue from MRA customers as a result of lower fuel costs, milder weather, decreased customer usage as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and fewer opportunity sales.Wholesale revenues from sales to affiliates will vary depending on demand and the availability and cost of generating resources at each company. These affiliate sales are made in accordance with the IIC, as approved by the FERC. These transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings since this energy is generally sold at marginal cost.Wholesale revenues from sales to affiliates decreased $21 million, or 15.9%, in 2020 compared to 2019. This decrease was primarily due to a $34 million decrease associated with lower natural gas prices, partially offset by a $13 million increase associated with higher KWH sales due to the dispatch of Mississippi Power's generation resources to serve the Southern Company system's territorial load.Other operating revenues increased $7 million, or 38.9%, in 2020 as compared to the prior year primarily due to an increase in open access transmission tariff revenues.II-27 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2020 Annual ReportEnergy SalesChanges in revenues are influenced heavily by the change in the volume of energy sold from year to year. KWH sales for 2020 and the percent change from the prior year were as follows:2020TotalKWHsTotal KWHPercent ChangeWeather-Adjusted Percent Change(in millions)Residential2,023 (1.9)%3.3 %Commercial2,513 (7.4)(7.0)Industrial4,558 (4.9)(4.9)Other35 (3.3)(3.3)Total retail9,129 (5.0)(3.8)%WholesaleNon-affiliated3,784 (4.6)Affiliated5,226 9.8 Total wholesale9,010 3.3 Total energy sales18,139 (1.1)%Changes in retail energy sales are generally the result of changes in electricity usage by customers, weather, and the number of customers. Revenues attributable to changes in sales decreased in 2020 when compared to 2019 largely due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Weather-adjusted residential KWH sales increased 3.3% compared to 2019 primarily due to an increase in average customer usage as a result of changes in customer behavior and work-from-home policies in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Weather-adjusted commercial KWH sales decreased 7.0% primarily due to lower customer usage resulting from changes in consumer and business behavior, including the temporary closure of casinos, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Industrial KWH sales decreased 4.9% primarily as a result of disruptions in supply chain and business operations driven by the COVID-19 pandemic and the overall decrease in business activity due to the resulting recession. See ""Operating Revenues"" above for a discussion of significant changes in wholesale revenues to affiliated companies.Fuel and Purchased Power ExpensesThe mix of fuel sources for generation of electricity is determined primarily by demand, the unit cost of fuel consumed, and the availability of generating units. Additionally, Mississippi Power purchases a portion of its electricity needs from the wholesale market.Details of Mississippi Power's generation and purchased power were as follows:20202019Total generation (in millions of KWHs)17,833 18,269 Total purchased power (in millions of KWHs)688 529 Sources of generation (percent) –Gas94 94 Coal6 6 Cost of fuel, generated (in cents per net KWH) –Gas1.97 2.26 Coal3.62 4.05 Average cost of fuel, generated (in cents per net KWH)2.08 2.37 Average cost of purchased power (in cents per net KWH)3.27 3.71 Fuel and purchased power expenses were $372 million in 2020, a decrease of $55 million, or 12.9%, as compared to the prior year. The decrease was primarily due to the lower average cost of natural gas.II-28 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2020 Annual ReportFuel and purchased power energy transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings, since energy expenses are generally offset by energy revenues through Mississippi Power's fuel cost recovery clauses. See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Mississippi Power – Fuel Cost Recovery and Note 1 to the financial statements under ""Fuel Costs"" for additional information.FuelFuel expense decreased $57 million, or 14.0%, in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to a 12.6% decrease in the average cost of natural gas per KWH generated, a 10.7% decrease in the average cost of coal per KWH generated, and a 3.0% decrease in the volume of KWHs generated by natural gas.Purchased Power Purchased power expense increased $2 million, or 10.0%, in 2020 compared to 2019. The increase was primarily the result of a 30.2% increase in the volume of KWHs purchased, partially offset by an 11.9% decrease in the average cost per KWH purchased.Energy purchases will vary depending on the market prices of wholesale energy as compared to the cost of the Southern Company system's generation, demand for energy within the Southern Company system's service territory, and the availability of the Southern Company system's generation. These purchases are made in accordance with the IIC or other contractual agreements, as approved by the FERC.Other Operations and Maintenance ExpensesOther operations and maintenance expenses decreased $23 million, or 7.5%, in 2020 compared to the prior year. The decrease primarily reflects the impacts of a $23 million accrual in 2019 for the closeout of a DOE contract related to the Kemper County energy facility. See Note 3 to the financial statements under ""Other Matters – Mississippi Power – Kemper County Energy Facility"" for additional information.Depreciation and AmortizationDepreciation and amortization decreased $9 million, or 4.7%, in 2020 compared to 2019. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in regulatory asset amortization of $21 million primarily as a result of completing amortization of the ECO Plan regulatory asset in 2019. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in depreciation of $12 million related to additional plant in service and an increase in depreciation rates in accordance with the Mississippi Power Rate Case Settlement Agreement. See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Mississippi Power – 2019 Base Rate Case"" and "" – Environmental Compliance Overview Plan"" for additional information.Taxes Other Than Income TaxesTaxes other than income taxes increased $11 million, or 9.7%, in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to an increase in ad valorem taxes.Interest Expense, Net of Amounts CapitalizedInterest expense, net of amounts capitalized decreased $9 million, or 13.0%, in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily as the result of a decrease in outstanding long-term borrowings. See Note 8 to the financial statements for additional information.Income Taxes (Benefit)Income tax expense decreased $16 million, or 53.3%, in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to the flowback of excess deferred income taxes as a result of the Mississippi Power Rate Case Settlement Agreement. See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Mississippi Power – 2019 Base Rate Case"" and Note 10 to the financial statements for additional information.Southern PowerNet income attributable to Southern Power for 2020 was $238 million, a $101 million decrease from 2019, primarily due to the $88 million after-tax gain on the sale of Plant Nacogdoches in the second quarter 2019, partially offset by the $23 million after-tax gain on the sale of Plant Mankato in the first quarter 2020. In addition, the decrease reflects the reduced net income resulting from these dispositions. See Note 15 to the financial statements under ""Southern Power – Sales of Natural Gas and Biomass Plants"" for additional information.II-29 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2020 Annual ReportA condensed statement of income follows:2020Increase(Decrease)from 2019(in millions)Operating revenues$1,733 $(205)Fuel470 (107)Purchased power74 (34)Other operations and maintenance353 (6)Depreciation and amortization494 15 Taxes other than income taxes39 (1)Asset impairment— (3)(Gain) loss on dispositions, net(39)(16)Total operating expenses1,391 (152)Operating income342 (53)Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized151 (18)Other income (expense), net19 (28)Income taxes (benefit)3 59 Net income207 (122)Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests(31)(21)Net income attributable to Southern Power$238 $(101)Operating RevenuesTotal operating revenues include PPA capacity revenues, which are derived primarily from long-term contracts involving natural gas facilities and a biomass generating facility (through the second quarter 2019 sale of Plant Nacogdoches), and PPA energy revenues from Southern Power's generation facilities. To the extent Southern Power has capacity not contracted under a PPA, it may sell power into an accessible wholesale market, or, to the extent those generation assets are part of the FERC-approved IIC, it may sell power into the Southern Company power pool.Natural Gas and Biomass Capacity and Energy RevenueCapacity revenues generally represent the greatest contribution to operating income and are designed to provide recovery of fixed costs plus a return on investment.Energy is generally sold at variable cost or is indexed to published natural gas indices. Energy revenues will vary depending on the energy demand of Southern Power's customers and their generation capacity, as well as the market prices of wholesale energy compared to the cost of Southern Power's energy. Energy revenues also include fees for support services, fuel storage, and unit start charges. Increases and decreases in energy revenues under PPAs that are driven by fuel or purchased power prices are accompanied by an increase or decrease in fuel and purchased power costs and do not have a significant impact on net income.Solar and Wind Energy RevenueSouthern Power's energy sales from solar and wind generating facilities are predominantly through long-term PPAs that do not have capacity revenue. Customers either purchase the energy output of a dedicated renewable facility through an energy charge or pay a fixed price related to the energy generated from the respective facility and sold to the grid. As a result, Southern Power's ability to recover fixed and variable operations and maintenance expenses is dependent upon the level of energy generated from these facilities, which can be impacted by weather conditions, equipment performance, transmission constraints, and other factors. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – ""Southern Power's Power Sales Agreements"" herein for additional information regarding Southern Power's PPAs.II-30 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2020 Annual ReportOperating Revenues DetailsDetails of Southern Power's operating revenues were as follows:20202019(in millions)PPA capacity revenues $384 $482 PPA energy revenues 1,019 1,081 Total PPA revenues1,403 1,563 Non-PPA revenues 316 363 Other revenues14 12 Total operating revenues$1,733 $1,938 Operating revenues for 2020 were $1.7 billion, a $205 million, or 11%, decrease from 2019. The decrease in operating revenues was primarily due to the following:•PPA capacity revenues decreased $98 million, or 20%, primarily due to decreases of $72 million related to the dispositions of Plant Nacogdoches in the second quarter 2019 and Plant Mankato in the first quarter 2020 and $24 million from the contractual expiration of an affiliate natural gas PPA.•PPA energy revenues decreased $62 million, or 6%, primarily due to a $125 million decrease in sales from natural gas facilities resulting from an $89 million decrease in the volume of KWHs sold due to decreased demand and a $36 million decrease in the price of fuel and purchased power. This decrease was partially offset by increases of $33 million in sales primarily driven by the volume of KWHs generated by solar and wind facilities and $30 million in sales from fuel cell generation acquired in 2019.•Non-PPA revenues decreased $47 million, or 13%, due to a $99 million decrease in the market price of energy, partially offset by a $52 million increase in the volume of KWHs sold through short-term sales.Fuel and Purchased Power ExpensesDetails of Southern Power's generation and purchased power were as follows:TotalKWHsTotal KWH % ChangeTotalKWHs20202019(in billions of KWHs)Generation4447Purchased power33Total generation and purchased power47(6)%50Total generation and purchased power (excluding solar, wind, and tolling agreements)28(3)%29Southern Power's PPAs for natural gas generation generally provide that the purchasers are responsible for either procuring the fuel (tolling agreements) or reimbursing Southern Power for substantially all of the cost of fuel relating to the energy delivered under such PPAs. Consequently, changes in such fuel costs are generally accompanied by a corresponding change in related fuel revenues and do not have a significant impact on net income. Southern Power is responsible for the cost of fuel for generating units that are not covered under PPAs. Power from these generating units is sold into the wholesale market or into the Southern Company power pool for capacity owned directly by Southern Power.Purchased power expenses will vary depending on demand, availability, and the cost of generating resources throughout the Southern Company system and other contract resources. Load requirements are submitted to the Southern Company power pool on an hourly basis and are fulfilled with the lowest cost alternative, whether that is generation owned by Southern Power, an affiliate company, or external parties. Such purchased power costs are generally recovered through PPA revenues.II-31 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2020 Annual ReportDetails of Southern Power's fuel and purchased power expenses were as follows:20202019(in millions)Fuel$470 $577 Purchased power74 108 Total fuel and purchased power expenses$544 $685 In 2020, total fuel and purchased power expenses decreased $141 million, or 21%, compared to 2019. Fuel expense decreased $107 million, or 19%, due to an $82 million decrease in the average cost of fuel per KWH generated and a $25 million decrease associated with the volume of KWHs generated. Purchased power expense decreased $34 million, or 31%, due to a $21 million decrease associated with the average cost of purchased power and a $13 million decrease associated with the volume of KWHs purchased.(Gain) Loss on Dispositions, NetIn 2020, gain on dispositions, net increased $16 million, or 70%, compared to 2019 reflecting the sale of Plant Mankato in the first quarter 2020 and the sale of Plant Nacogdoches in the second quarter 2019. See Note 15 to the financial statements under ""Southern Power – Sales of Natural Gas and Biomass Plants"" for additional information.Interest Expense, Net of Amounts CapitalizedIn 2020, interest expense, net of amounts capitalized decreased $18 million, or 11%, compared to 2019, primarily due to a decrease in the amount of outstanding debt. See Note 8 to the financial statements for additional information.Other Income (Expense), NetIn 2020, other income (expense), net decreased $28 million, or 60%, compared to 2019 primarily due to a $36 million gain arising from a litigation settlement in 2019, partially offset by the resolution of certain related contingencies in the third quarter 2020.Income Taxes (Benefit)In 2020, income tax expense was $3 million compared to a $56 million benefit for 2019, a change of $59 million, primarily due to a $75 million income tax benefit in 2019 resulting from ITCs recognized upon the sale of Plant Nacogdoches, partially offset by a decrease in income tax expense as a result of lower pre-tax earnings in 2020. See Notes 1, 10, and 15 to the financial statements under ""Income Taxes,"" ""Effective Tax Rate,"" and ""Southern Power,"" respectively, for additional information.Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Noncontrolling InterestsIn 2020, net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests increased $21 million compared to 2019. The increased loss was primarily due to an allocation to the noncontrolling interest partner of approximately $26 million of income related to a litigation settlement in 2019.Southern Company GasOperating MetricsSouthern Company Gas continues to focus on several operating metrics, including Heating Degree Days, customer count, and volumes of natural gas sold.Southern Company Gas measures weather and the effect on its business using Heating Degree Days. Generally, increased Heating Degree Days result in higher demand for natural gas on Southern Company Gas' distribution system. Southern Company Gas has various regulatory mechanisms, such as weather and revenue normalization and straight-fixed-variable rate design, which limit its exposure to weather changes within typical ranges in each of its utility's respective service territory, including Nicor Gas following the approval of a revenue decoupling mechanism for residential customers in its base rate case that concluded in 2019. Southern Company Gas also utilizes weather hedges to limit the negative income impacts in the event of warmer-than-normal weather.The number of customers served by gas distribution operations and gas marketing services can be impacted by natural gas prices, economic conditions, and competition from alternative fuels. Gas distribution operations and gas marketing services' customers are primarily located in Georgia and Illinois.II-32 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2020 Annual ReportSouthern Company Gas' natural gas volume metrics for gas distribution operations and gas marketing services illustrate the effects of weather and customer demand for natural gas. Wholesale gas services' physical sales volumes represent the daily average natural gas volumes sold to its customers.Seasonality of ResultsDuring the Heating Season, natural gas usage and operating revenues are generally higher as more customers are connected to the gas distribution systems and natural gas usage is higher in periods of colder weather. Occasionally in the summer, wholesale gas services' operating revenues are impacted due to peak usage by power generators in response to summer energy demands. Southern Company Gas' base operating expenses, excluding cost of natural gas, bad debt expense, and certain incentive compensation costs, are incurred relatively evenly throughout the year. Seasonality also affects the comparison of certain balance sheet items across quarters, including receivables, unbilled revenues, natural gas for sale, and notes payable. However, these items are comparable when reviewing Southern Company Gas' annual results. Thus, Southern Company Gas' operating results can vary significantly from quarter to quarter as a result of seasonality, which is illustrated in the table below.Percent Generated DuringHeating SeasonOperating RevenuesNetIncome202067.6 %85.6 %201968.7 %86.8 %Net IncomeNet income attributable to Southern Company Gas in 2020 was $590 million, an increase of $5 million, or 0.9%, compared to the prior year. This increase was primarily due to impairment charges in 2019 of $69 million related to Jefferson Island and $17 million in contemplation of the sale of interests in Pivotal LNG and Atlantic Coast Pipeline, a $16 million gain in 2020 related to the sale of Jefferson Island, and a $53 million increase at gas distribution operations primarily due to base rate increases for all of the natural gas distribution utilities and continued investment in infrastructure replacement programs, partially offset by reduced flowback of excess deferred income taxes at Atlanta Gas Light in 2020. These increases were partially offset by a $149 million decrease at wholesale gas services in 2020 primarily due to lower commercial activity and lower derivative gains. See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Southern Company Gas"" for additional information.A condensed income statement for Southern Company Gas follows:2020Increase (Decrease) from 2019(in millions)Operating revenues$3,434 $(358)Cost of natural gas972 (347)Other operations and maintenance966 78 Depreciation and amortization500 13 Taxes other than income taxes206 (7)Impairment charges— (115)(Gain) loss on dispositions, net (22)(22)Total operating expenses2,622 (400)Operating income812 42 Earnings from equity method investments141 (16)Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized231 (1)Other income (expense), net41 21 Income taxes173 43 Net Income$590 $5 II-33 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2020 Annual ReportOperating RevenuesOperating revenues in 2020 were $3.4 billion, a $358 million decrease compared to 2019. Details of operating revenues were as follows:2020(in millions)Operating revenues – prior year$3,792 Estimated change resulting from –Infrastructure replacement programs and base rate changes186 Gas costs and other cost recovery(319)Wholesale gas services(220)Other(5)Operating revenues – current year$3,434 Percent change(9.4)%Revenues at the natural gas distribution utilities increased in 2020 compared to the prior year due to base rate increases and continued investments recovered through infrastructure replacement programs, including increases of $107 million at Nicor Gas and $68 million at Atlanta Gas Light. See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Southern Company Gas"" for additional information.Revenues associated with gas costs and other cost recovery decreased in 2020 compared to the prior year primarily due to lower natural gas prices and lower sales volumes as a result of warmer weather. The natural gas distribution utilities have weather or revenue normalization mechanisms that mitigate revenue fluctuations from customer consumption changes. Natural gas distribution rates include provisions to adjust billings for fluctuations in natural gas costs. Therefore, gas costs recovered through natural gas revenues generally equal the amount expensed in cost of natural gas and do not affect net income from gas distribution operations. See ""Cost of Natural Gas"" herein for additional information.Revenues from wholesale gas services decreased in 2020 primarily due to lower derivative gains and decreased commercial activity as a result of warmer weather. See ""Segment Information – Wholesale Gas Services"" herein for additional information.Heating Degree Days During Heating Season, natural gas usage and operating revenues are generally higher. Weather typically does not have a significant net income impact other than during the Heating Season. The following table presents Heating Degree Days information for Illinois and Georgia, the primary locations where Southern Company Gas' operations are impacted by weather.Years Ended December 31,2020 vs. normal2020 vs. 2019Normal(a)20202019(warmer)(warmer)(in thousands)Illinois(b)5,777 5,477 6,136 (5.2)%(10.7)%Georgia2,483 2,122 2,157 (14.5)%(1.6)%(a)Normal represents the 10-year average from January 1, 2010 through December 31, 2019 for Illinois at Chicago Midway International Airport and for Georgia at Atlanta Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport, based on information obtained from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, National Climatic Data Center.(b)Heating Degree Days in Illinois had a limited financial impact in 2020 and the impact is expected to be limited in future years. In October 2019, Nicor Gas received approval for a volume balancing adjustment, a revenue decoupling mechanism for residential customers that provides a monthly benchmark level of revenue per rate class for recovery.Southern Company Gas hedged its exposure to warmer-than-normal weather in Illinois for gas distribution operations and in Illinois and Georgia for gas marketing services. The remaining impacts of weather on earnings were immaterial.II-34 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2020 Annual ReportCustomer Count The following table provides the number of customers served by Southern Company Gas at December 31, 2020 and 2019:20202019(in thousands, except market share %)Gas distribution operations4,308 4,277 Gas marketing servicesEnergy customers(*)666 631 Market share of energy customers in Georgia28.9 %28.9 %(*)Gas marketing services' customers are primarily located in Georgia and Illinois. December 31, 2020 also includes approximately 50,000 customers in Ohio contracted through an annual auction process to serve for 12 months beginning April 1, 2020.Southern Company Gas anticipates continued customer growth as it expects continued low natural gas prices. Southern Company Gas uses a variety of targeted marketing programs to attract new customers and to retain existing customers.Cost of Natural Gas Excluding Atlanta Gas Light, which does not sell natural gas to end-use customers, gas distribution operations charges its utility customers for natural gas consumed using natural gas cost recovery mechanisms set by the applicable state regulatory agencies. Under these mechanisms, all prudently-incurred natural gas costs are passed through to customers without markup, subject to regulatory review. Gas distribution operations defers or accrues the difference between the actual cost of natural gas and the amount of commodity revenue earned in a given period. The deferred or accrued amount is either billed or refunded to customers prospectively through adjustments to the commodity rate. Deferred natural gas costs are reflected as regulatory assets and accrued natural gas costs are reflected as regulatory liabilities. Therefore, gas costs recovered through natural gas revenues generally equal the amount expensed in cost of natural gas and do not affect net income from gas distribution operations. Cost of natural gas at gas distribution operations represented 88.3% of the total cost of natural gas for 2020.Gas marketing services customers are charged for actual and estimated natural gas consumed. Cost of natural gas includes the cost of fuel and associated transportation costs, lost and unaccounted for gas, adjustments to reduce the value of inventories to market value, if applicable, and gains and losses associated with certain derivatives.In 2020, cost of natural gas was $1.0 billion, a decrease of $347 million, or 26.3%, compared to the prior year, which reflects a 23.6% decrease in natural gas prices compared to 2019 and decreased volumes primarily as a result of warmer weather.Volumes of Natural Gas SoldThe following table details the volumes of natural gas sold during all periods presented.2020 vs. 201920202019% ChangeGas distribution operations (mmBtu in millions)Firm623 677 (8.0)%Interruptible92 92 — %Total715 769 (7.0)%Wholesale gas services (mmBtu in millions/day)Daily physical sales6.9 6.4 7.8 %Gas marketing services (mmBtu in millions)Firm:Georgia33 33 — %Illinois9 12 (25.0)%Other 13 15 (13.3)%Interruptible large commercial and industrial14 14 — %Total69 74 (6.8)%II-35 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2020 Annual ReportOther Operations and Maintenance ExpensesIn 2020, other operations and maintenance expenses increased $78 million, or 8.8%, compared to the prior year. The increase was primarily due to increases of $40 million in compensation and benefit expenses, $10 million in charitable donations, $12 million in pipeline repair, compliance, and maintenance activities, and $19 million in expenses passed through directly to customers primarily related to bad debt.Depreciation and AmortizationIn 2020, depreciation and amortization increased $13 million, or 2.7%, compared to the prior year. This increase was primarily due to continued infrastructure investments at gas distribution operations. See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Southern Company Gas – Infrastructure Replacement Programs and Capital Projects"" for additional information.Impairment ChargesIn 2019, Southern Company Gas recorded impairment charges of $91 million related to Jefferson Island and $24 million in contemplation of the sale of its interests in Pivotal LNG and Atlantic Coast Pipeline. See Notes 3 and 15 to the financial statements under ""Other Matters – Southern Company Gas"" and ""Southern Company Gas,"" respectively, for additional information.(Gain) Loss on Dispositions, NetIn 2020, gain on dispositions, net was $22 million resulting from the sale of Jefferson Island. See Note 15 to the financial statements under ""Southern Company Gas"" for additional information.Earnings from Equity Method InvestmentsIn 2020, earnings from equity method investments decreased $16 million, or 10.2%, compared to the prior year. This decrease was primarily due to a $12 million decrease in earnings from SNG as a result of lower demand and firm revenues and a $9 million decrease in earnings as a result of the sale of Atlantic Coast Pipeline in the first quarter 2020, partially offset by a $6 million pre-tax loss on the sale of Triton in May 2019. See Notes 7 and 15 to the financial statements under ""Southern Company Gas"" for additional information.Other Income (Expense), NetIn 2020, other income (expense), net increased $21 million compared to the prior year. This increase primarily resulted from an increase in non-service cost-related retirement benefits income. See Note 11 to the financial statements for additional information.Income TaxesIn 2020, income taxes increased $43 million, or 33.1%, compared to the prior year. This increase was primarily due to the reversal of a federal income tax valuation allowance in connection with the sale of Triton in 2019, a decrease in the flowback of excess deferred income taxes in 2020 at Atlanta Gas Light as previously authorized by the Georgia PSC, and higher pre-tax earnings. See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Southern Company Gas,"" Note 10 to the financial statements, and Note 15 to the financial statements under ""Southern Company Gas"" for additional information.Performance and Non-GAAP MeasuresAdjusted operating margin is a non-GAAP measure that is calculated as operating revenues less cost of natural gas, cost of other sales, and revenue tax expense. Adjusted operating margin excludes other operations and maintenance expenses, depreciation and amortization, taxes other than income taxes, impairment charges, and (gain) loss on dispositions, net, which are included in the calculation of operating income as calculated in accordance with GAAP and reflected in the statements of income. The presentation of adjusted operating margin is believed to provide useful information regarding the contribution resulting from base rate changes, infrastructure replacement programs and capital projects, and customer growth at gas distribution operations since the cost of natural gas and revenue tax expense can vary significantly and are generally billed directly to customers. Southern Company Gas further believes that utilizing adjusted operating margin at gas pipeline investments, wholesale gas services, and gas marketing services allows it to focus on a direct measure of performance before overhead costs. The applicable reconciliation of operating income to adjusted operating margin is provided herein.Adjusted operating margin should not be considered an alternative to, or a more meaningful indicator of, Southern Company Gas' operating performance than operating income as determined in accordance with GAAP. In addition, Southern Company Gas' adjusted operating margin may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.II-36 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2020 Annual ReportDetailed variance explanations of Southern Company Gas' financial performance are provided herein.Reconciliations of operating income to adjusted operating margin are as follows:20202019(in millions)Operating Income$812 $770 Other operating expenses(a)1,650 1,703 Revenue taxes(b)(104)(114)Adjusted Operating Margin$2,358 $2,359 (a)Includes other operations and maintenance, depreciation and amortization, taxes other than income taxes, impairment charges, and (gain) loss on dispositions, net.(b)Nicor Gas' revenue tax expenses, which are passed through directly to customers.Segment Information 20202019 Adjusted Operating Margin(*)Operating Expenses(*)Net Income (Loss) Adjusted Operating Margin(*)Operating Expenses (*)Net Income (Loss)(in millions)(in millions)Gas distribution operations$1,990 $1,335 $390 $1,799 $1,226 $337 Gas pipeline investments32 12 99 32 12 94 Wholesale gas services73 53 14 273 54 163 Gas marketing services240 121 89 234 122 83 All other29 36 (2)28 182 (92)Intercompany eliminations(6)(11)— (7)(7)— Consolidated$2,358 $1,546 $590 $2,359 $1,589 $585 (*)Adjusted operating margin and operating expenses are adjusted for Nicor Gas' revenue tax expenses, which are passed through directly to customers.Gas Distribution OperationsGas distribution operations is the largest component of Southern Company Gas' business and is subject to regulation and oversight by regulatory agencies in each of the states it serves. These agencies approve natural gas rates designed to provide Southern Company Gas with the opportunity to generate revenues to recover the cost of natural gas delivered to its customers and its fixed and variable costs, including depreciation, interest expense, operations and maintenance, taxes, and overhead costs, and to earn a reasonable return on its investments.With the exception of Atlanta Gas Light, Southern Company Gas' second largest utility that operates in a deregulated natural gas market and has a straight-fixed-variable rate design that minimizes the variability of its revenues based on consumption, the earnings of the natural gas distribution utilities can be affected by customer consumption patterns that are a function of weather conditions, price levels for natural gas, and general economic conditions that may impact customers' ability to pay for natural gas consumed. Southern Company Gas has various regulatory and other mechanisms, such as weather and revenue normalization mechanisms and weather derivative instruments, that limit its exposure to changes in customer consumption, including weather changes within typical ranges in its natural gas distribution utilities' service territories.In 2020, net income increased $53 million, or 16%, compared to the prior year. The increase primarily relates to $191 million in adjusted operating margin which reflects base rate increases for all of the natural gas distribution utilities and continued investments recovered through infrastructure replacement programs. The $109 million increase in operating expenses includes increases for compensation and benefit expenses and pipeline compliance as well as bad debt costs passed through directly to customers. The increase also reflects higher depreciation primarily due to additional assets placed in service. The $27 million increase in other income is primarily due to an increase in non-service cost-related retirement benefits income. The $51 million increase in income tax expense is primarily due to higher pre-tax earnings and a decrease in the flowback of excess deferred income taxes at Atlanta Gas Light as authorized by the Georgia PSC.See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Southern Company Gas – Rate Proceedings – Atlanta Gas Light"" and "" – Infrastructure Replacement Programs and Capital Projects – Atlanta Gas Light"" herein for additional information on Atlanta Gas II-37 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2020 Annual ReportLight's stipulation reflecting the impacts of the Tax Reform Legislation. Also see Note 11 to the financial statements for additional information on retirement benefits.Gas Pipeline InvestmentsGas pipeline investments consists primarily of joint ventures in natural gas pipeline investments including SNG, PennEast Pipeline, Dalton Pipeline, and Atlantic Coast Pipeline (until its sale on March 24, 2020). Net income in 2020 increased $5 million, or 5%, compared to the prior year. This increase primarily relates to a $25 million decrease in income taxes primarily related to a 2019 increase associated with changes in state apportionment rates, partially offset by a $12 million decrease in earnings from SNG and a $9 million decrease in earnings as a result of the sale of the interest in Atlantic Coast Pipeline. See Note 7 to the financial statements under ""Southern Company Gas"" for additional information.Wholesale Gas ServicesWholesale gas services is involved in asset management and optimization, storage, transportation, producer and peaking services, natural gas supply, natural gas services, and wholesale gas marketing. Southern Company Gas has positioned the business to generate positive economic earnings on an annual basis even under low volatility market conditions that can result from a number of factors. When market price volatility increases, wholesale gas services is well positioned to capture significant value and generate stronger results. Operating expenses primarily reflect employee compensation and benefits.Net income in 2020 decreased $149 million, or 91%, compared to the prior year. This decrease primarily relates to a $200 million decrease in adjusted operating margin, partially offset by a $49 million decrease in income taxes due to lower pre-tax earnings.Details of adjusted operating margin are provided in the table below. 20202019(in millions)Commercial activity recognized$(40)$54 Gain on storage derivatives8 40 Gain on transportation and forward commodity derivatives106 186 LOCOM adjustments, net of current period recoveries— (16)Purchase accounting adjustments to fair value inventory and contracts(1)9 Adjusted operating margin$73 $273 Change in Commercial ActivityThe commercial activity at wholesale gas services includes recognition of storage and transportation values that were generated in prior periods, which reflect the impact of prior period hedge gains and losses as associated physical transactions occur. The decrease in commercial activity in 2020 compared to the prior year was primarily due to warmer-than-normal weather conditions and tightening transportation spreads.Change in Storage and Transportation DerivativesVolatility in the natural gas market arises from a number of factors, such as weather fluctuations or changes in supply or demand for natural gas in different regions of the U.S. The volatility of natural gas commodity prices has a significant impact on Southern Company Gas' customer rates, long-term competitive position against other energy sources, and the ability of wholesale gas services to capture value from locational and seasonal spreads. Forward storage or time spreads applicable to the locations of wholesale gas services' specific storage positions in 2020 resulted in storage derivative gains. Transportation and forward commodity derivative gains in 2020 are primarily the result of narrowing transportation spreads due to supply constraints and increases in natural gas supply, which impacted forward prices at natural gas receipt and delivery points, primarily in the Northeast and Midwest regions.The natural gas that wholesale gas services purchases and injects into storage is accounted for at the LOCOM value utilizing gas daily or spot prices at the end of the year. See Note 1 to the financial statements under ""Natural Gas for Sale"" for additional information.Withdrawal Schedule and Physical Transportation TransactionsThe expected natural gas withdrawals from storage and expected offset to prior hedge losses/gains associated with the transportation portfolio of wholesale gas services are presented in the following table, along with the net operating revenues expected at the time of withdrawal from storage and the physical flow of natural gas between contracted transportation receipt and II-38 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2020 Annual Reportdelivery points. Wholesale gas services' expected net operating revenues exclude storage and transportation demand charges, as well as other variable fuel, withdrawal, receipt, and delivery charges, and exclude estimated profit sharing under asset management agreements. Further, the amounts that are realizable in future periods are based on the inventory withdrawal schedule, planned physical flow of natural gas between the transportation receipt and delivery points, and forward natural gas prices at December 31, 2020. A portion of wholesale gas services' storage inventory and transportation capacity is economically hedged with futures contracts, which results in the realization of substantially fixed net operating revenues.Storage Withdrawal Physical Transportation TransactionsTotal storage(a)Expected net operating gains (losses)(b)Expected net operating gains (losses)(c)(in mmBtu in millions)(in millions)(in millions)202140 $23 $(65)2022 and thereafter76 (41)Total at December 31, 202047$29 $(106)(a)At December 31, 2020, the WACOG of wholesale gas services' expected natural gas withdrawals from storage was $1.81 per mmBtu.(b)Represents expected operating gains from planned storage withdrawals associated with existing inventory positions and could change as wholesale gas services adjusts its daily injection and withdrawal plans in response to changes in future market conditions and forward NYMEX price fluctuations. (c)Represents the expected net losses during the periods in which the derivatives will be settled and the physical transportation transactions will occur that offset the derivative gains and losses previously recognized.Gas Marketing ServicesGas marketing services provides energy-related products and services to natural gas markets and participants in customer choice programs that were approved in various states to increase competition. These programs allow customers to choose their natural gas supplier while the local distribution utility continues to provide distribution and transportation services. Gas marketing services is weather sensitive and uses a variety of hedging strategies, such as weather derivative instruments and other risk management tools, to partially mitigate potential weather impacts.Net income increased $6 million, or 7%, in 2020 compared to the prior year. This increase primarily relates to a $6 million increase in adjusted operating margin, which primarily reflects recovery of prior period hedge losses.All OtherAll other includes natural gas storage businesses, including Jefferson Island through its sale on December 1, 2020, fuels operations through the sale of Southern Company Gas' interest in Pivotal LNG on March 24, 2020, the investment in Triton through its sale on May 29, 2019, AGL Services Company, and Southern Company Gas Capital, as well as various corporate operating expenses that are not allocated to the reportable segments and interest income (expense) associated with affiliate financing arrangements.Net loss decreased $90 million, or 98%, in 2020 compared to the prior year. This decrease primarily reflects a $146 million decrease in operating expenses primarily related to impairment charges in 2019 of $91 million related to Jefferson Island and $24 million in contemplation of the sale of Southern Company Gas' interests in Pivotal LNG and Atlantic Coast Pipeline. Also included was the $22 million pre-tax gain on the sale of Jefferson Island and a $5 million increase in earnings from equity method investments primarily due to a pre-tax loss on the sale of Triton in 2019, partially offset by a $65 million increase in income taxes as a result of lower pre-tax losses. See Note 15 to the financial statements under ""Southern Company Gas"" for additional information.Segment ReconciliationsReconciliations of operating income to adjusted operating margin for 2020 and 2019 are provided in the following tables.

Retail rates and earnings are reviewed and may be adjusted periodically within certain limitations. Prices for wholesale electricity sales, interconnecting transmission lines, and the exchange of electric power are regulated by the FERC. Southern Power continues to focus on long-term PPAs. See ACCOUNTING POLICIES – ""Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – Utility Regulation"" herein and Note 2 to the financial statements for additional information about regulatory matters.Each Registrant's results of operations are not necessarily indicative of its future earnings potential. The disposition activities described in Note 15 to the financial statements have reduced earnings for the applicable Registrants. The level of the Registrants' future earnings depends on numerous factors that affect the opportunities, challenges, and risks of the Registrants' primary businesses of selling electricity and/or distributing natural gas, as described further herein.For the traditional electric operating companies, these factors include the ability to maintain constructive regulatory environments that allow for the timely recovery of prudently-incurred costs during a time of increasing costs, continued customer growth, and the trend of reduced electricity usage per customer, especially in residential and commercial markets. For Georgia Power, completing construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 and related cost recovery proceedings is another major factor.Earnings in the electricity business will also depend upon maintaining and growing sales, considering, among other things, the adoption and/or penetration rates of increasingly energy-efficient technologies and increasing volumes of electronic commerce transactions, which could contribute to a net reduction in customer usage.Global and U.S. economic conditions have been significantly affected by a series of demand and supply shocks that have caused a global and national economic recession. Most prominently, the COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted global supply chains and global demand for goods and services and public policy responses of social distancing and closing non-essential businesses have further restricted economic activity. The drivers, speed, and depth of this economic contraction are unprecedented and have reduced energy demand across the Southern Company system's service territory, primarily in the commercial and industrial classes. The negative impacts, which started in late-March 2020, of the COVID-19 pandemic and related recession on the Southern Company system's retail electric sales began to improve in the middle of May 2020; however, retail electric revenues declined slightly in 2020 compared to 2019. Recovery is expected to continue into the second half of 2021, but responses to the II-40 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2020 Annual ReportCOVID-19 pandemic by both customers and governments could significantly affect the pace of recovery. The ultimate extent of the negative impact on revenues depends on the depth and duration of the economic contraction in the Southern Company system's service territory and cannot be determined at this time. See RESULTS OF OPERATIONS herein for information on COVID-19-related impacts on energy demand in the Southern Company system's service territory during 2020.The traditional electric operating companies have established installment payment plans to allow customers to repay over a period of time past due accounts resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. See Note 2 to the financial statements for additional information on the status of disconnections and the deferral of costs resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic at Georgia Power, Mississippi Power, and the natural gas distribution utilities. The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.The level of future earnings for Southern Power's competitive wholesale electric business depends on numerous factors including Southern Power's ability to execute its growth strategy through the development or acquisition of renewable facilities and other energy projects while containing costs, as well as regulatory matters, creditworthiness of customers, total electric generating capacity available in Southern Power's market areas, and Southern Power's ability to successfully remarket capacity as current contracts expire. In addition, renewable portfolio standards, availability of tax credits, transmission constraints, cost of generation from units within the Southern Company power pool, and operational limitations could influence Southern Power's future earnings.The level of future earnings for Southern Company Gas' primary business of distributing natural gas and its complementary businesses in the gas pipeline investments, wholesale gas services, and gas marketing services sectors depends on numerous factors. These factors include the natural gas distribution utilities' ability to maintain constructive regulatory environments that allow for the timely recovery of prudently-incurred costs, the completion and subsequent operation of ongoing infrastructure and other construction projects, creditworthiness of customers, and Southern Company Gas' ability to optimize its transportation and storage positions and to re-contract storage rates at favorable prices. The volatility of natural gas prices has an impact on Southern Company Gas' customer rates, its long-term competitive position against other energy sources, and the ability of Southern Company Gas' gas marketing services and wholesale gas services businesses to capture value from locational and seasonal spreads. Additionally, changes in commodity prices subject a portion of Southern Company Gas' operations to earnings variability. Over the longer term, volatility is expected to be low to moderate and locational and/or transportation spreads are expected to decrease as new pipelines are built to reduce the existing supply constraints in the shale areas of the Northeast U.S. To the extent these pipelines are delayed or not built, volatility could increase. See Note 3 to the financial statements under ""Other Matters – Southern Company Gas – PennEast Pipeline Project"" for additional information on permitting challenges experienced by the PennEast Pipeline. Additional economic factors may contribute to this environment, including a significant drop in oil and natural gas prices, which could lead to consolidation of natural gas producers or reduced levels of natural gas production. In addition, if the COVID-19 pandemic results in continued economic uncertainty for a sustained period, demand for natural gas may decrease, resulting in further downward pressure on natural gas prices and lower volatility in the natural gas markets on a longer-term basis.Earnings for both the electricity and natural gas businesses are subject to a variety of other factors. These factors include weather, competition, developing new and maintaining existing energy contracts and associated load requirements with wholesale customers, energy conservation practiced by customers, the use of alternative energy sources by customers, government incentives to reduce overall energy usage, the prices of electricity and natural gas, and the price elasticity of demand. Demand for electricity and natural gas in the Registrants' service territories is primarily driven by the pace of economic growth or decline that may be affected by changes in regional and global economic conditions, which may impact future earnings.Mississippi Power provides service under long-term contracts with rural electric cooperative associations and a municipality located in southeastern Mississippi under full requirements cost-based electric tariffs which are subject to regulation by the FERC. The contracts with these wholesale customers represented 15.3% of Mississippi Power's total operating revenues in 2020 and are generally subject to 10-year rolling cancellation notices. Historically, these wholesale customers have acted as a group and any changes in contractual relationships for one customer are likely to be followed by the other wholesale customers.As part of its ongoing effort to adapt to changing market conditions, Southern Company continues to evaluate and consider a wide array of potential business strategies. These strategies may include business combinations, partnerships, and acquisitions involving other utility or non-utility businesses or properties, disposition of certain assets or businesses, internal restructuring, or some combination thereof. Furthermore, Southern Company may engage in new business ventures that arise from competitive and regulatory changes in the utility industry. Pursuit of any of the above strategies, or any combination thereof, may significantly affect the business operations, risks, and financial condition of Southern Company. In addition, Southern Power and Southern Company Gas regularly consider and evaluate joint development arrangements as well as acquisitions and dispositions of businesses and assets as part of their business strategies. See Note 15 to the financial statements for additional information.II-41 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2020 Annual ReportEnvironmental MattersThe Southern Company system's operations are regulated by state and federal environmental agencies through a variety of laws and regulations governing air, water, land, and other natural resources. The Southern Company system maintains comprehensive environmental compliance and GHG strategies to assess both current and upcoming requirements and compliance costs associated with these environmental laws and regulations. The costs required to comply with environmental laws and regulations and to achieve stated goals, including capital expenditures, operations and maintenance costs, and costs reflected in ARO liabilities, may impact future electric generating unit retirement and replacement decisions (which are subject to approval from the traditional electric operating companies' respective state PSCs), results of operations, cash flows, and/or financial condition. Related costs may result from the installation of additional environmental controls, closure and monitoring of CCR facilities, unit retirements, or changing fuel sources for certain existing units, as well as related upgrades to the Southern Company system's transmission and distribution (electric and natural gas) systems. A major portion of these costs is expected to be recovered through retail and wholesale rates, including existing ratemaking and billing provisions. The ultimate impact of environmental laws and regulations and the GHG goals discussed herein cannot be determined at this time and will depend on various factors, such as state adoption and implementation of requirements, the availability and cost of any deployed technology, fuel prices, and the outcome of pending and/or future legal challenges.New or revised environmental laws and regulations could affect many areas of operations for the Subsidiary Registrants. The impact of any such changes cannot be determined at this time. Environmental compliance costs could affect earnings, cash flows, and/or financial condition if such costs cannot continue to be recovered on a timely basis in rates for the traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities or through long-term wholesale agreements for the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power.Alabama Power and Mississippi Power recover environmental compliance costs through separate mechanisms, Rate CNP Compliance and the ECO Plan, respectively. Georgia Power's base rates include an ECCR tariff that allows for the recovery of environmental compliance costs. The natural gas distribution utilities of Southern Company Gas generally recover environmental remediation expenditures through rate mechanisms approved by their applicable state regulatory agencies. See Notes 2 and 3 to the financial statements for additional information.Southern Power's PPAs generally contain provisions that permit charging the counterparty with some of the new costs incurred as a result of changes in environmental laws and regulations. Since Southern Power's units are generally newer natural gas and renewable generating facilities, costs associated with environmental compliance for these facilities have been less significant than for similarly situated coal or older natural gas generating facilities. Environmental, natural resource, and land use concerns, including the applicability of air quality limitations, the potential presence of wetlands or threatened and endangered species, the availability of water withdrawal rights, uncertainties regarding impacts such as increased light or noise, and concerns about potential adverse health impacts can, however, increase the cost of siting and operating any type of future electric generating facility. The impact of such laws, regulations, and other considerations on Southern Power and subsequent recovery through PPA provisions cannot be determined at this time.Further, increased costs that are recovered through regulated rates could contribute to reduced demand for electricity and natural gas, which could negatively affect results of operations, cash flows, and/or financial condition. Additionally, many commercial and industrial customers may also be affected by existing and future environmental requirements, which for some may have the potential to affect their demand for electricity and natural gas.Although the timing, requirements, and estimated costs could change as environmental laws and regulations are adopted or modified, as compliance plans are revised or updated, and as legal challenges to rules are initiated or completed, estimated capital expenditures through 2025 based on the current environmental compliance strategy for the Southern Company system and the traditional electric operating companies are as follows:20212022202320242025Total(in millions)Southern Company$120 $145 $257 $255 $152 $929 Alabama Power67 78 78 99 70 392 Georgia Power34 42 164 151 59 450 Mississippi Power19 15 9 5 14 62 These estimates do not include any costs associated with potential regulation of GHG emissions. See ""Global Climate Issues"" herein for additional information. The Southern Company system also anticipates substantial expenditures associated with ash II-42 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2020 Annual Reportpond closure and ground water monitoring under the CCR Rule and related state rules, which are reflected in the applicable Registrants' ARO liabilities. See FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY – ""Cash Requirements"" herein and Note 6 to the financial statements for additional information.Environmental Laws and RegulationsExecutive OrdersOn January 20, 2021, President Biden issued a regulatory freeze that requires further reviews of certain regulatory actions authorized under the previous administration before they become effective. President Biden also signed executive orders related to federal regulations and subsequently signed additional orders to address climate change and other environmental issues.Air QualityThe Southern Company system reduced SO2 and NOX air emissions by 99% and 91%, respectively, from 1990 to 2019. The Southern Company system reduced mercury air emissions by over 97% from 2005 to 2019.The EPA finalized regional haze regulations in 2005 and 2017. These regulations require states, tribal governments, and various federal agencies to develop and implement plans to reduce pollutants that impair visibility and demonstrate reasonable progress toward the goal of restoring natural visibility conditions in certain areas, including national parks and wilderness areas. States are required to submit state implementation plans for the second 10-year planning period (2018 through 2028) by July 31, 2021. These plans could require further reductions in particulate matter, SO2, and/or NOX, which could result in increased compliance costs at affected electric generating units.Water QualityIn 2014, the EPA finalized requirements under Section 316(b) of the Clean Water Act (CWA) to regulate cooling water intake structures (CWIS) to minimize their effects on fish and other aquatic life at existing power plants. The regulation requires plant-specific studies to determine applicable CWIS changes to protect organisms. The results of these plant-specific studies, which are ongoing within the Southern Company system, are being submitted with each plant's next National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit cycle. The Southern Company system anticipates applicable CWIS changes may include fish-friendly CWIS screens with fish return systems and minor additions of monitoring equipment at certain plants. The impact of this rule will depend on the outcome of these plant-specific studies, any additional protective measures required to be incorporated into each plant's NPDES permit based on site-specific factors, and the outcome of any legal challenges.In 2015, the EPA finalized the steam electric effluent limitations guidelines (ELG) rule (2015 ELG Rule) that set national standards for wastewater discharges from new and existing steam electric generating units generating greater than 50 MWs, including substantially all of the coal-fired generating units in the Southern Company system. The 2015 ELG Rule prohibits effluent discharges of certain wastestreams and imposes stringent limits on flue gas desulfurization (FGD) wastewater discharges. On October 13, 2020, the EPA published the final ELG reconsideration rule, a reconsideration of the 2015 ELG Rule's limits on bottom ash transport water and FGD wastewater that extends the latest applicability date for both discharges to December 31, 2025. The ELG reconsideration rule also updates the voluntary incentive program and provides new subcategories for low utilization electric generating units and electric generating units that will permanently cease coal combustion by 2028. An initial notice of planned participation (NOPP) must be submitted to the applicable permitting authority no later than October 13, 2021 for units seeking to qualify for these subcategories. A subsequent NOPP must be submitted to transfer a unit to an alternative compliance option. The 2015 ELG Rule and the ELG reconsideration rule (ELG rules) are expected to require capital expenditures and increased operational costs for the traditional electric operating companies and SEGCO. For Georgia Power's Plant Wansley Units 1 and 2, which are currently challenged due to their operating profiles and positions within the economic dispatch, the anticipated cost of the controls necessary to comply with the ELG rules could accelerate a determination that continued operation is uneconomical. As a result, Georgia Power may request in its 2022 IRP filing to accelerate the retirement of these units, which had a net book value totaling approximately $665 million at December 31, 2020. However, the ultimate impact of the ELG rules will depend on the Southern Company system's final assessment of compliance options, the incorporation of these assessments into each of the traditional electric operating company's IRP processes, the incorporation of these new requirements into each generating unit's NPDES permit, and the outcome of legal challenges. The ELG reconsideration rule has been challenged by several environmental organizations and the cases have been consolidated in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.II-43 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2020 Annual ReportCoal Combustion ResidualsIn 2015, the EPA finalized non-hazardous solid waste regulations for the disposal of CCR, including coal ash and gypsum, in landfills and surface impoundments (ash ponds) at active electric generating power plants. The CCR Rule requires landfills and ash ponds to be evaluated against a set of performance criteria and potentially closed if certain criteria are not met. Closure of existing landfills and ash ponds requires installation of equipment and infrastructure to manage CCR in accordance with the CCR Rule. The EPA is in the process of amending portions of the CCR Rule.In addition to the CCR Rule, the States of Alabama and Georgia finalized state regulations regarding the handling of CCR within their respective states. The State of Georgia received approval from the EPA on its partial permit program implementing the state CCR permit program in lieu of the federal self-implementing rule in accordance with the Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation Act. On February 15, 2021, revisions to align State of Alabama regulations with the federal CCR Rule became effective, as approved by the Alabama Environmental Management Commission. The State of Mississippi has not yet developed a state CCR permit program.Based on requirements for closure and monitoring of landfills and ash ponds pursuant to the CCR Rule and applicable state rules, the traditional electric operating companies have periodically updated, and expect to continue periodically updating, their related cost estimates and ARO liabilities for each CCR unit as additional information related to ash pond closure methodologies, schedules, and/or costs becomes available. Some of these updates have been, and future updates may be, material. Additionally, the closure designs and plans in the States of Alabama and Georgia are subject to approval by environmental regulatory agencies. Absent continued recovery of ARO costs through regulated rates, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition for Southern Company and the traditional electric operating companies could be materially impacted. See FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY – ""Cash Requirements,"" Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Georgia Power – Rate Plans,"" and Note 6 to the financial statements for additional information.Environmental RemediationThe Southern Company system must comply with environmental laws and regulations governing the handling and disposal of waste and releases of hazardous substances. Under these various laws and regulations, the Southern Company system could incur substantial costs to clean up affected sites. The traditional electric operating companies and Southern Company Gas conduct studies to determine the extent of any required cleanup and have recognized the estimated costs to clean up known impacted sites in their financial statements. Amounts for cleanup and ongoing monitoring costs were not material for any year presented. The traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities in Illinois and Georgia (which represent substantially all of Southern Company Gas' accrued remediation costs) have all received authority from their respective state PSCs or other applicable state regulatory agencies to recover approved environmental remediation costs through regulatory mechanisms. These regulatory mechanisms are adjusted annually or as necessary within limits approved by the state PSCs or other applicable state regulatory agencies. The traditional electric operating companies and Southern Company Gas may be liable for some or all required cleanup costs for additional sites that may require environmental remediation. See Note 3 to the financial statements under ""Environmental Remediation"" for additional information.Global Climate IssuesIn July 2019, the EPA published the final Affordable Clean Energy rule (ACE Rule) to repeal and replace the CPP. The ACE Rule requires states to develop unit-specific CO2 emission rate standards for existing coal-fired units based on heat-rate efficiency improvements. On January 19, 2021, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals vacated and remanded the ACE Rule back to the EPA. Once the decision becomes final, the ACE Rule will no longer be in effect.On January 20, 2021, President Biden accepted the Paris Agreement on behalf of the United States, which will result in the United States officially becoming a party to the agreement on February 19, 2021. The Paris Agreement establishes a non-binding universal framework for addressing GHG emissions based on nationally determined emissions reduction contributions and sets in place a process for tracking progress towards the goals every five years.Additional GHG policies, including legislation, may emerge in the future requiring the United States to transition to a lower GHG emitting economy; however, associated impacts are currently unknown. The Southern Company system has transitioned from an electric generating mix of 70% coal and 15% natural gas in 2007 to a mix of 18% coal and 53% natural gas in 2020, along with over 10,000 MWs of renewable resource capacity. This transition has been supported in part by the Southern Company system retiring over 5,600 MWs of coal- and oil-fired generating capacity since 2010 and converting over 3,400 MWs of generating capacity from coal to natural gas since 2015. In addition, Southern Company Gas has replaced over 6,000 miles of pipe material that was more prone to fugitive emissions (unprotected steel and cast-iron pipe), resulting in mitigation of more than 3.3 million metric tons of CO2 equivalents from its natural gas distribution system since 1998.II-44 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2020 Annual ReportThe following table provides the Registrants' 2019 and preliminary 2020 GHG emissions based on equity share of facilities:2019Preliminary 2020(in million metric tons of CO2 equivalent)Southern Company(*)8875Alabama Power3328Georgia Power2821Mississippi Power98Southern Power(*)1312Southern Company Gas11(*)Includes GHG emissions attributable to disposed assets through the date of the applicable disposition and to acquired assets beginning with the date of the applicable acquisition. See Note 15 to the financial statements for additional information.With 2007 as a baseline, in 2018, Southern Company system management established an interim goal of a 50% reduction in carbon emissions by 2030 and a long-term goal of low- to no-carbon operations by 2050. In 2020, Southern Company system management updated the long-term GHG emissions reduction goal to net zero emissions by 2050. Based on the preliminary 2020 emissions, the Southern Company system achieved an estimated GHG emission reduction of 52% since 2007. In 2020, the combination of the COVID-19 pandemic and relatively mild weather significantly reduced demand. As these factors fluctuate, coal generation and GHG emissions may temporarily increase in future years. Southern Company system management expects to achieve sustained GHG emissions reductions of at least 50% as early as 2025. Southern Company system management, working with applicable regulators, plans to transition its generating fleet in a manner responsible to customers, communities, employees, and other stakeholders. Achievement of these goals is dependent on many factors, including natural gas prices and the pace and extent of development of low- to no-carbon energy technologies and negative carbon concepts. Southern Company system management will continue to pursue a diverse portfolio including low-carbon and carbon-free resources and energy efficiency resources; continue its research and development with a particular focus on technologies that lower GHG emissions, including methods of removing carbon from the atmosphere; and constructively engage with policymakers, regulators, investors, and customers to support outcomes leading to a net zero future.Regulatory MattersSee OVERVIEW – ""Recent Developments"" herein and Note 2 to the financial statements for a discussion of regulatory matters related to Alabama Power, Georgia Power, Mississippi Power, and Southern Company Gas, including items that could impact the applicable registrants' future earnings, cash flows, and/or financial condition.Construction ProgramsThe Subsidiary Registrants are engaged in continuous construction programs to accommodate existing and estimated future loads on their respective systems. The Southern Company system intends to continue its strategy of developing and constructing new electric generating facilities, expanding and improving the electric transmission and electric and natural gas distribution systems, and undertaking projects to comply with environmental laws and regulations.For the traditional electric operating companies, major generation construction projects are subject to state PSC approval in order to be included in retail rates. The largest construction project currently underway in the Southern Company system is Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Georgia Power – Nuclear Construction"" for additional information. Also see Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Alabama Power – Petition for Certificate of Convenience and Necessity"" for information regarding Alabama Power's construction of Plant Barry Unit 8.See Note 15 to the financial statements under ""Southern Power"" for information about costs relating to Southern Power's acquisitions that involve construction of renewable energy facilities.Southern Company Gas is engaged in various infrastructure improvement programs designed to update or expand the natural gas distribution systems of the natural gas distribution utilities to improve reliability and meet operational flexibility and growth. The natural gas distribution utilities recover their investment and a return associated with these infrastructure programs through their regulated rates. See Notes 2 and 3 to the financial statements under ""Southern Company Gas – Infrastructure Replacement Programs and Capital Projects"" and ""Other Matters – Southern Company Gas – PennEast Pipeline Project,"" respectively, for additional information on Southern Company Gas' construction program.II-45 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2020 Annual ReportSee FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY – ""Cash Requirements"" herein for additional information regarding the Registrants' capital requirements for their construction programs, including estimated totals for each of the next five years.Southern Power's Power Sales AgreementsGeneralSouthern Power has PPAs with some of the traditional electric operating companies, other investor-owned utilities, IPPs, municipalities, and other load-serving entities, as well as commercial and industrial customers. The PPAs are expected to provide Southern Power with a stable source of revenue during their respective terms.Many of Southern Power's PPAs have provisions that require Southern Power or the counterparty to post collateral or an acceptable substitute guarantee if (i) S&P or Moody's downgrades the credit ratings of the respective company to an unacceptable credit rating, (ii) the counterparty is not rated, or (iii) the counterparty fails to maintain a minimum coverage ratio.Southern Power is working to maintain and expand its share of the wholesale markets. During 2020, Southern Power continued to be successful in remarketing 350 MWs to 1,130 MWs of annual natural gas generation capacity to load-serving entities through several PPAs extending over the next 17 years. Market demand is being driven by load-serving entities replacing expired purchase contracts and/or retired generation, as well as planning for future growth. However, generation capacity market forecasts indicate an oversupply, especially in the Southeast, and the highly competitive remarketing environment is expected to continue in the near term.Natural GasSouthern Power's electricity sales from natural gas facilities are primarily through long-term PPAs that consist of two types of agreements. The first type, referred to as a unit or block sale, is a customer purchase from a dedicated generating unit where all or a portion of the generation from that unit is reserved for that customer. Southern Power typically has the ability to serve the unit or block sale customer from an alternate resource. The second type, referred to as requirements service, provides that Southern Power serve the customer's capacity and energy requirements from a combination of the customer's own generating units and from Southern Power resources not dedicated to serve unit or block sales. Southern Power has rights to purchase power provided by the requirements customers' resources when economically viable.As a general matter, substantially all of the PPAs provide that the purchasers are responsible for either procuring the fuel (tolling agreements) or reimbursing Southern Power for substantially all of the cost of fuel or purchased power relating to the energy delivered under such PPAs. To the extent a particular generating facility does not meet the operational requirements contemplated in the PPAs, Southern Power may be responsible for excess fuel costs. With respect to fuel transportation risk, most of Southern Power's PPAs provide that the counterparties are responsible for the availability of fuel transportation to the particular generating facility.Capacity charges that form part of the PPA payments are designed to recover fixed and variable operation and maintenance costs based on dollars-per-kilowatt year. In general, to reduce Southern Power's exposure to certain operation and maintenance costs, Southern Power has LTSAs. See Note 1 to the financial statements under ""Long-Term Service Agreements"" for additional information.Solar and WindSouthern Power's electricity sales from solar and wind (renewable) generating facilities are also primarily through long-term PPAs; however, these solar and wind PPAs do not have a capacity charge and customers either purchase the energy output of a dedicated renewable facility through an energy charge or provide Southern Power a certain fixed price for the electricity sold to the grid. As a result, Southern Power's ability to recover fixed and variable operations and maintenance expenses is dependent upon the level of energy generated from these facilities, which can be impacted by weather conditions, equipment performance, transmission constraints, and other factors. Generally, under the renewable generation PPAs, the purchasing party retains the right to keep or resell the renewable energy credits.Southern Company Gas' Affiliate Asset Management AgreementsWith the exception of Nicor Gas, the natural gas distribution utilities use asset management agreements with an affiliate, Sequent, for the primary purpose of reducing utility customers' gas cost recovery rates through payments to the utilities by Sequent. For Atlanta Gas Light, these payments are set by the Georgia PSC and are utilized for infrastructure improvements and to fund heating assistance programs, rather than as a reduction to gas cost recovery rates. Under these asset management agreements, Sequent supplies natural gas to the utility and markets available pipeline and storage capacity to improve the overall cost of supplying gas to the utility customers. Currently, the natural gas distribution utilities primarily purchase their gas from II-46 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2020 Annual ReportSequent. The purchase agreements require Sequent to provide firm gas to the natural gas distribution utilities, but the natural gas distribution utilities maintain the right and ability to make their own long-term supply arrangements if they believe it is in the best interest of their customers.Each agreement provides for Sequent to make payments to the natural gas distribution utility through an annual minimum guarantee within a profit sharing structure, a profit sharing structure without an annual minimum guarantee, or a fixed fee.Income Tax MattersConsolidated Income TaxesThe impact of certain tax events at Southern Company and/or its other subsidiaries can, and does, affect each Registrant's ability to utilize certain tax credits. See ""Tax Credits"" and ACCOUNTING POLICIES – ""Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – Accounting for Income Taxes"" herein and Note 10 to the financial statements for additional information.Tax CreditsThe Tax Reform Legislation, as modified by the 2021 Consolidated Appropriations Act signed into law in December 2020, retained solar energy incentives of 30% ITC for projects that commenced construction by December 31, 2019; 26% ITC for projects that commence construction in 2020 through 2022; 22% ITC for projects that commence construction in 2023; and a permanent 10% ITC for projects that commence construction on or after January 1, 2024, or projects which are placed in service after December 31, 2025 regardless of when construction began. In addition, the Tax Reform Legislation retained wind energy incentives for projects that commenced construction in 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019 of 100% PTC, 80% PTC, 60% PTC, and 40% PTC, respectively. As a result of a tax extenders bill passed in December 2019 and the 2021 Consolidated Appropriations Act, projects that begin construction in 2020 or 2021 are entitled to 60% PTC. Projects commencing construction after 2021 will not be entitled to any PTCs. Southern Company has received ITCs and PTCs in connection with investments in solar, wind, fuel cell, and biomass facilities primarily at Southern Power and Georgia Power.Southern Power's ITCs relate to its investment in new solar facilities acquired or constructed and its PTCs relate to the first 10 years of energy production from its wind facilities, which have had, and may continue to have, a material impact on Southern Power's cash flows and net income. At December 31, 2020, Southern Company and Southern Power had approximately $1.4 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively, of unutilized ITCs and PTCs, which are currently expected to be fully utilized by 2024, but could be further delayed. Since 2018, Southern Power has been utilizing tax equity partnerships for wind and solar projects, where the tax partner takes significantly all of the respective federal tax benefits. These tax equity partnerships are consolidated in Southern Company's and Southern Power's financial statements using the HLBV methodology to allocate partnership gains and losses. See Note 1 to the financial statements under ""General"" for additional information on the HLBV methodology and Note 1 to the financial statements under ""Income Taxes"" and Note 10 to the financial statements under ""Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities – Tax Credit Carryforwards"" and ""Effective Tax Rate"" for additional information regarding utilization and amortization of credits and the tax benefit related to associated basis differences.Alabama State Tax Reform LegislationOn February 12, 2021, the State of Alabama enacted tax legislation that changes the apportionment methodology effective for the 2021 tax year. This legislation is expected to reduce the amount of Southern Power's future earnings apportioned to the State of Alabama and, thus, reduce Southern Power's existing state accumulated deferred tax liabilities, which would have a favorable impact on Southern Power's net income. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.General Litigation and Other MattersThe Registrants are involved in various matters being litigated and/or regulatory and other matters that could affect future earnings, cash flows, and/or financial condition. The ultimate outcome of such pending or potential litigation against each Registrant and any subsidiaries or regulatory and other matters cannot be determined at this time; however, for current proceedings and/or matters not specifically reported herein or in Notes 2 and 3 to the financial statements, management does not anticipate that the ultimate liabilities, if any, arising from such current proceedings and/or matters would have a material effect on such Registrant's financial statements. See Notes 2 and 3 to the financial statements for a discussion of various contingencies, including matters being litigated, regulatory matters, and other matters which may affect future earnings potential.II-47 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2020 Annual ReportACCOUNTING POLICIESApplication of Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesThe Registrants prepare their financial statements in accordance with GAAP. Significant accounting policies are described in the notes to the financial statements. In the application of these policies, certain estimates are made that may have a material impact on the results of operations and related disclosures of the applicable Registrants (as indicated in the section descriptions herein). Different assumptions and measurements could produce estimates that are significantly different from those recorded in the financial statements. Senior management has reviewed and discussed the following critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of Southern Company's Board of Directors.Utility Regulation (Southern Company, Alabama Power, Georgia Power, Mississippi Power, and Southern Company Gas)The traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities are subject to retail regulation by their respective state PSCs or other applicable state regulatory agencies and wholesale regulation by the FERC. These regulatory agencies set the rates the traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities are permitted to charge customers based on allowable costs, including a reasonable ROE. As a result, the traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities apply accounting standards which require the financial statements to reflect the effects of rate regulation. Through the ratemaking process, the regulators may require the inclusion of costs or revenues in periods different than when they would be recognized by a non-regulated company. This treatment may result in the deferral of expenses and the recording of related regulatory assets based on anticipated future recovery through rates or the deferral of gains or creation of liabilities and the recording of related regulatory liabilities. The application of the accounting standards for rate regulated entities also impacts their financial statements as a result of the estimates of allowable costs used in the ratemaking process. These estimates may differ from those actually incurred by the traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities; therefore, the accounting estimates inherent in specific costs such as depreciation, AROs, and pension and other postretirement benefits have less of a direct impact on the results of operations and financial condition of the applicable Registrants than they would on a non-regulated company.Revenues related to regulated utility operations as a percentage of total operating revenues in 2020 for the applicable Registrants were as follows: 89% for Southern Company, 99% for Alabama Power, 96% for Georgia Power, 99% for Mississippi Power, and 86% for Southern Company Gas.As reflected in Note 2 to the financial statements, significant regulatory assets and liabilities have been recorded. Management reviews the ultimate recoverability of these regulatory assets and any requirement to refund these regulatory liabilities based on applicable regulatory guidelines and GAAP. However, adverse legislative, judicial, or regulatory actions could materially impact the amounts of such regulatory assets and liabilities and could adversely impact the financial statements of the applicable Registrants.Estimated Cost, Schedule, and Rate Recovery for the Construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4(Southern Company and Georgia Power)In 2016, the Georgia PSC approved the Vogtle Cost Settlement Agreement, which resolved certain prudency matters in connection with Georgia Power's fifteenth VCM report. In 2017, the Georgia PSC approved Georgia Power's seventeenth VCM report, which included a recommendation to continue construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, with Southern Nuclear serving as project manager and Bechtel serving as the primary construction contractor, as well as a modification of the Vogtle Cost Settlement Agreement. The Georgia PSC's related order stated that under the modified Vogtle Cost Settlement Agreement, (i) none of the $3.3 billion of costs incurred through December 31, 2015 should be disallowed as imprudent; (ii) the Contractor Settlement Agreement was reasonable and prudent and none of the $0.3 billion paid pursuant to the Contractor Settlement Agreement should be disallowed from rate base on the basis of imprudence; (iii) capital costs incurred up to $5.68 billion would be presumed to be reasonable and prudent with the burden of proof on any party challenging such costs; (iv) Georgia Power would have the burden of proof to show that any capital costs above $5.68 billion were prudent; (v) Georgia Power's total project capital cost forecast of $7.3 billion (net of $1.7 billion received under the Guarantee Settlement Agreement and approximately $188 million in related customer refunds) was found reasonable and did not represent a cost cap; and (vi) prudence decisions would be made subsequent to achieving fuel load for Unit 4.In its order, the Georgia PSC also stated if other conditions change and assumptions upon which Georgia Power's seventeenth VCM report are based do not materialize, the Georgia PSC reserved the right to reconsider the decision to continue construction.As of December 31, 2020, Georgia Power revised its total project capital cost forecast to $8.7 billion (net of $1.7 billion received under the Guarantee Settlement Agreement and approximately $188 million in related customer refunds). This forecast includes II-48 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2020 Annual Reportconstruction contingency of $171 million and is based on the regulatory-approved in-service dates of November 2021 for Unit 3 and November 2022 for Unit 4. Since 2018, construction contingency totaling $0.5 billion has been assigned to the base capital cost forecast. Although Georgia Power believes these incremental costs are reasonable and necessary to complete the project and the Georgia PSC's order in the seventeenth VCM proceeding specifically states that the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 is not subject to a cost cap, Georgia Power did not seek rate recovery for a $0.7 billion increase in the base capital cost forecast in 2018 and has not sought rate recovery for the construction contingency costs. After considering the significant level of uncertainty that exists regarding the future recoverability of these costs since the ultimate outcome of these matters is subject to the outcome of future assessments by management, as well as Georgia PSC decisions in these future regulatory proceedings, Georgia Power recorded total pre-tax charges to income of $1.1 billion ($0.8 billion after tax) in the second quarter 2018 and $149 million ($111 million after tax) and $176 million ($131 million after tax) as of June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2020, respectively.As part of its ongoing processes, Southern Nuclear continues to evaluate cost and schedule forecasts on a regular basis to incorporate current information available, particularly in the areas of engineering support, commodity installation, system turnovers and related test results, and workforce statistics. The project continues to face challenges including, but not limited to, higher than expected absenteeism; overall construction and subcontractor labor productivity; system turnover and testing activities; and electrical equipment and commodity installation. In addition, Georgia Power estimates the productivity impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic have consumed approximately three to four months of embedded schedule margin. With minimal schedule margin remaining, the Unit 3 schedule is challenged, and any further extension of the hot functional testing or fuel load milestones, or other delays from the challenges described below, could impact the ability to achieve the November 2021 in-service date.As construction, including subcontract work, continues and testing and system turnover activities increase, challenges with management of contractors and vendors; subcontractor performance; supervision of craft labor and related productivity, particularly in the installation of electrical, mechanical, and instrumentation and controls commodities, ability to attract and retain craft labor, and/or related cost escalation; procurement, fabrication, delivery, assembly, installation, system turnover, and the initial testing and start-up, including any required engineering changes or any remediation related thereto, of plant systems, structures, or components (some of which are based on new technology that only within the last few years began initial operation in the global nuclear industry at this scale), any of which may require additional labor and/or materials; or other issues could arise and change the projected schedule and estimated cost. In addition, the continuing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic could further disrupt or delay construction and testing activities at Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4.There have been technical and procedural challenges to the construction and licensing of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 at the federal and state level and additional challenges may arise. Processes are in place that are designed to assure compliance with the requirements specified in the Westinghouse Design Control Document and the combined construction and operating licenses, including inspections by Southern Nuclear and the NRC that occur throughout construction. Findings resulting from such inspections could require additional remediation and/or further NRC oversight. In addition, certain license amendment requests have been filed and approved or are pending before the NRC. Various design and other licensing-based compliance matters, including the timely submittal by Southern Nuclear of the ITAAC documentation for each unit and the related reviews and approvals by the NRC necessary to support NRC authorization to load fuel, may arise, which may result in additional license amendments or require other resolution. If any license amendment requests or other licensing-based compliance issues, including inspections and ITAACs, are not resolved in a timely manner, there may be delays in the project schedule that could result in increased costs.The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time. However, any schedule extension beyond the regulatory-approved in-service dates is currently estimated to result in additional base capital costs for Georgia Power of approximately $25 million per month for Unit 3 and approximately $15 million per month for Unit 4, as well as the related AFUDC. While Georgia Power is not precluded from seeking recovery of any future capital cost forecast increase, management will ultimately determine whether or not to seek recovery. Any further changes to the capital cost forecast that are not expected to be recoverable through regulated rates will be required to be charged to income and such charges could be material.Given the significant complexity involved in estimating the future costs to complete construction and start-up of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 and the significant management judgment necessary to assess the related uncertainties surrounding future rate recovery of any projected cost increases, as well as the potential impact on results of operations and cash flows, Southern Company and Georgia Power consider these items to be critical accounting estimates. See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Georgia Power – Nuclear Construction"" for additional information.II-49 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2020 Annual ReportAccounting for Income Taxes (Southern Company, Mississippi Power, Southern Power, and Southern Company Gas)The consolidated income tax provision and deferred income tax assets and liabilities, as well as any unrecognized tax benefits and valuation allowances, require significant judgment and estimates. These estimates are supported by historical tax return data, reasonable projections of taxable income, the ability and intent to implement tax planning strategies if necessary, and interpretations of applicable tax laws and regulations across multiple taxing jurisdictions. The effective tax rate reflects the statutory tax rates and calculated apportionments for the various states in which the Southern Company system operates.Southern Company files a consolidated federal income tax return and the Registrants file various state income tax returns, some of which are combined or unitary. Under a joint consolidated income tax allocation agreement, each Southern Company subsidiary's current and deferred tax expense is computed on a stand-alone basis and each subsidiary is allocated an amount of tax similar to that which would be paid if it filed a separate income tax return. In accordance with IRS regulations, each company is jointly and severally liable for the federal tax liability. Certain deductions and credits can be limited or utilized at the consolidated or combined level resulting in tax credit and/or state NOL carryforwards that would not otherwise result on a stand-alone basis. Utilization of these carryforwards and the assessment of valuation allowances are based on significant judgment and extensive analysis of Southern Company's and its subsidiaries' current financial position and results of operations, including currently available information about future years, to estimate when future taxable income will be realized.Current and deferred state income tax liabilities and assets are estimated based on laws of multiple states that determine the income to be apportioned to their jurisdictions. States have various filing methodologies and utilize specific formulas to calculate the apportionment of taxable income. The calculation of deferred state taxes considers apportionment factors and filing methodologies that are expected to apply in future years. The apportionments and methodologies which are ultimately finalized in a manner inconsistent with expectations could have a material effect on the financial statements of the applicable Registrants.Given the significant judgment involved in estimating tax credit and/or state NOL carryforwards and multi-state apportionments for all subsidiaries, the applicable Registrants consider deferred income tax liabilities and assets to be critical accounting estimates.Asset Retirement Obligations (Southern Company, Alabama Power, Georgia Power, Mississippi Power, and Southern Company Gas)AROs are computed as the present value of the estimated costs for an asset's future retirement and are recorded in the period in which the liability is incurred. The estimated costs are capitalized as part of the related long-lived asset and depreciated over the asset's useful life. In the absence of quoted market prices, AROs are estimated using present value techniques in which estimates of future cash outlays associated with the asset retirements are discounted using a credit-adjusted risk-free rate. Estimates of the timing and amounts of future cash outlays are based on projections of when and how the assets will be retired and the cost of future removal activities.The ARO liabilities for the traditional electric operating companies primarily relate to facilities that are subject to the CCR Rule and the related state rules, principally ash ponds. In addition, Alabama Power and Georgia Power have retirement obligations related to the decommissioning of nuclear facilities (Alabama Power's Plant Farley and Georgia Power's ownership interests in Plant Hatch and Plant Vogtle Units 1 and 2). Other significant AROs include various landfill sites and asbestos removal for Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and Mississippi Power and gypsum cells and mine reclamation for Mississippi Power.The traditional electric operating companies and Southern Company Gas also have identified other retirement obligations, such as obligations related to certain electric transmission and distribution facilities, certain asbestos-containing material within long-term assets not subject to ongoing repair and maintenance activities, certain wireless communication towers, the disposal of polychlorinated biphenyls in certain transformers, leasehold improvements, equipment on customer property, and property associated with the Southern Company system's rail lines and natural gas pipelines. However, liabilities for the removal of these assets have not been recorded because the settlement timing for certain retirement obligations related to these assets is indeterminable and, therefore, the fair value of the retirement obligations cannot be reasonably estimated. A liability for these retirement obligations will be recognized when sufficient information becomes available to support a reasonable estimation of the ARO.The cost estimates for AROs related to the disposal of CCR are based on information using various assumptions related to closure and post-closure costs, timing of future cash outlays, inflation and discount rates, and the potential methods for complying with the CCR Rule and the related state rules. The traditional electric operating companies have periodically updated, and expect to continue periodically updating, their related cost estimates and ARO liabilities for each CCR unit as additional information related to these assumptions becomes available. Some of these updates have been, and future updates may be, material. See Note 6 to the financial statements for additional information, including increases to AROs related to ash ponds recorded during 2020 by certain Registrants.II-50 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2020 Annual ReportGiven the significant judgment involved in estimating AROs, the applicable Registrants consider the liabilities for AROs to be critical accounting estimates.Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits (Southern Company, Alabama Power, Georgia Power, Mississippi Power, and Southern Company Gas)The applicable Registrants' calculations of pension and other postretirement benefits expense are dependent on a number of assumptions. These assumptions include discount rates, healthcare cost trend rates, expected long-term rate of return (LRR) on plan assets, mortality rates, expected salary and wage increases, and other factors. Components of pension and other postretirement benefits expense include interest and service cost on the pension and other postretirement benefit plans, expected return on plan assets, and amortization of certain unrecognized costs and obligations. Actual results that differ from the assumptions utilized are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, generally affect recognized expense and the recorded obligation in future periods. While the applicable Registrants believe the assumptions used are appropriate, differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions would affect their pension and other postretirement benefit costs and obligations.Key elements in determining the applicable Registrants' pension and other postretirement benefit expense are the LRR and the discount rate used to measure the benefit plan obligations and the periodic benefit plan expense for future periods. For purposes of determining the applicable Registrants' liabilities related to the pension and other postretirement benefit plans, Southern Company discounts the future related cash flows using a single-point discount rate for each plan developed from the weighted average of market-observed yields for high quality fixed income securities with maturities that correspond to expected benefit payments. The discount rate assumption impacts both the service cost and non-service costs components of net periodic benefit costs as well as the projected benefit obligations.The LRR on pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets is based on Southern Company's investment strategy, historical experience, and expectations that consider external actuarial advice, and represents the average rate of earnings expected over the long term on the assets invested to provide for anticipated future benefit payments. Southern Company determines the amount of the expected return on plan assets component of non-service costs by applying the LRR of various asset classes to Southern Company's target asset allocation. The LRR only impacts the non-service costs component of net periodic benefit costs for the following year and is set annually at the beginning of the year.II-51 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2020 Annual ReportThe following table illustrates the sensitivity to changes in the applicable Registrants' long-term assumptions with respect to the discount rate, salary increases, and the long-term rate of return on plan assets:Increase/(Decrease) in25 Basis Point Change in:Total Benefit Expense for 2021Projected Obligation for Pension Plan at December 31, 2020Projected Obligation forOther PostretirementBenefit Plans at December 31, 2020(in millions)Discount rate:Southern Company$42/$(40)$628/$(592)$57/$(54)Alabama Power$11/$(10)$151/$(142)$14/$(14)Georgia Power$12/$(11)$187/$(177)$20/$(19)Mississippi Power$2/$(2)$28/$(27)$2/$(2)Southern Company Gas$–/$–$43/$(40)$6/$(6)Salaries:Southern Company$25/$(24)$136/$(132)$–/$–Alabama Power$7/$(7)$38/$(37)$–/$–Georgia Power$7/$(7)$39/$(38)$–/$–Mississippi Power$1/$(1)$6/$(6)$–/$–Southern Company Gas$1/$(1)$3/$(3)$–/$–Long-term return on plan assets:Southern Company$38/$(38)N/AN/AAlabama Power$10/$(10)N/AN/AGeorgia Power$12/$(12)N/AN/AMississippi Power$2/$(2)N/AN/ASouthern Company Gas$3/$(3)N/AN/ASee Note 11 to the financial statements for additional information regarding pension and other postretirement benefits.Asset Impairment (Southern Company, Southern Power, and Southern Company Gas)Goodwill (Southern Company and Southern Company Gas)The acquisition method of accounting requires the assets acquired and liabilities assumed to be recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective estimated fair values. The applicable Registrants have recognized goodwill as of the date of their acquisitions, as a residual over the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis in the fourth quarter of the year as well as on an interim basis as events and changes in circumstances occur, including, but not limited to, a significant change in operating performance, the business climate, legal or regulatory factors, or a planned sale or disposition of a significant portion of the business. A reporting unit is the operating segment, or a business one level below the operating segment (a component), if discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by management. Components are aggregated if they have similar economic characteristics.As part of the impairment tests, the applicable Registrant may perform an initial qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit is less than its carrying amount before applying the quantitative goodwill impairment test. If the applicable Registrant elects to perform the qualitative assessment, it evaluates relevant events and circumstances, including but not limited to, macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, cost factors, financial performance, entity specific events, and events specific to each reporting unit. If the applicable Registrant determines that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, or it elects not to perform a qualitative assessment, it compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value to determine if the fair value is greater than its carrying value.Goodwill for Southern Company and Southern Company Gas was $5.3 billion and $5.0 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2020. For its annual impairment tests, Southern Company Gas performed the qualitative assessment and determined that it was II-52 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2020 Annual Reportmore likely than not that the fair value of all of its reporting units with goodwill exceeded their carrying amounts, and therefore no quantitative analysis was required. For its annual impairment tests for PowerSecure, Southern Company performed the quantitative assessment, which resulted in the fair value of goodwill at PowerSecure exceeding its carrying value in all years presented. However, Southern Company recorded goodwill impairment charges totaling $34 million in 2019 as a result of its decision to sell certain PowerSecure business units. See Note 15 to the financial statements under ""Southern Company"" for additional information. The continued COVID-19 pandemic and related responses continue to disrupt supply chains, reduce labor availability and productivity, and reduce economic activity. These effects could have a variety of adverse impacts on Southern Company and its subsidiaries, including the $263 million of goodwill recorded at PowerSecure. If the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic becomes significant to the operating results of PowerSecure and its businesses, a portion of the associated goodwill may become impaired. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.The judgments made in determining the estimated fair value assigned to each class of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as well as asset lives, can significantly impact the applicable Registrant's results of operations. Fair values and useful lives are determined based on, among other factors, the expected future period of benefit of the asset, the various characteristics of the asset, and projected cash flows. As the determination of an asset's fair value and useful life involves management making certain estimates and because these estimates form the basis for the determination of whether or not an impairment charge should be recorded, the applicable Registrants consider these estimates to be critical accounting estimates.See Note 1 to the financial statements under ""Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets and Liabilities"" for additional information regarding the applicable Registrants' goodwill.Long-Lived Assets (Southern Company, Southern Power, and Southern Company Gas)Impairments of long-lived assets of the traditional electric utilities and natural gas distribution utilities are generally related to specific regulatory disallowances. The applicable Registrants assess their other long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset's carrying amount may not be recoverable. If an indicator exists, the asset is tested for recoverability by comparing the asset carrying value to the sum of the undiscounted expected future cash flows directly attributable to the asset's use and eventual disposition. If the estimate of undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset, the fair value of the asset is determined and a loss is recorded equal to the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the asset. In addition, when assets are identified as held for sale, an impairment loss is recognized to the extent the carrying value of the assets or asset group exceeds their fair value less cost to sell. A high degree of judgment is required in developing estimates related to these evaluations, which are based on projections of various factors, some of which have been quite volatile in recent years.Southern Power's investments in long-lived assets are primarily generation assets. Excluding the natural gas distribution utilities, Southern Company Gas' investments in long-lived assets are primarily natural gas transportation and storage facility assets, whether in service or under construction. In addition, exclusive of the traditional electric operating companies and natural gas distribution utilities, Southern Company's investments in long-lived assets also include investments in leveraged leases. During 2020, Southern Company recorded impairment charges totaling $206 million ($105 million after tax) related to two of its leveraged lease investments.For Southern Power, examples of impairment indicators could include significant changes in construction schedules, current period losses combined with a history of losses or a projection of continuing losses, a significant decrease in market prices, the inability to remarket generating capacity for an extended period, or the unplanned termination of a customer contract or the inability of a customer to perform under the terms of the contract. For Southern Company Gas, examples of impairment indicators could include, but are not limited to, significant changes in the U.S. natural gas storage market, construction schedules, current period losses combined with a history of losses or a projection of continuing losses, a significant decrease in market prices, the inability to renew or extend customer contracts or the inability of a customer to perform under the terms of the contract, attrition rates, or the inability to deploy a development project. For Southern Company's investments in leveraged leases, impairment indicators include changes in estimates of future rental payments to be received under the lease as well as the residual value of the leased asset at the end of the lease.As the determination of the expected future cash flows generated from an asset, an asset's fair value, and useful life involves management making certain estimates and because these estimates form the basis for the determination of whether or not an impairment charge should be recorded, the applicable Registrants consider these estimates to be critical accounting estimates.See Note 3 to the financial statements under ""Other Matters"" and Note 15 to the financial statements for additional information on certain assets recently evaluated for impairment, including Southern Company's leveraged lease investments.II-53 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2020 Annual ReportDerivatives and Hedging Activities (Southern Company and Southern Company Gas)Determining whether a contract meets the definition of a derivative instrument, contains an embedded derivative requiring bifurcation, or qualifies for hedge accounting treatment is complex. The treatment of a single contract may vary from period to period depending upon accounting elections, changes in the applicable Registrant's assessment of the likelihood of future hedged transactions, or new interpretations of accounting guidance. As a result, judgment is required in determining the appropriate accounting treatment. In addition, the estimated fair value of derivative instruments may change significantly from period to period depending upon market conditions, and changes in hedge effectiveness may impact the accounting treatment.Derivative instruments (including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts) are recorded on the balance sheets as either assets or liabilities measured at their fair value. If the transaction qualifies for, and is designated as, a normal purchase or normal sale, it is exempt from fair value accounting treatment and is, instead, subject to traditional accrual accounting. The applicable Registrant utilizes market data or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the derivative asset or liability, including assumptions about risk and the risks inherent in the inputs of the valuation technique.Changes in the derivatives' fair value are recognized concurrently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met. If the derivatives meet those criteria, derivative gains and losses offset related results of the hedged item in the income statement in the case of a fair value hedge, or gains and losses are deferred in OCI on the balance sheets until the hedged transaction affects earnings in the case of a cash flow hedge. Additionally, a company is required to formally designate a derivative as a hedge as well as document and assess the effectiveness of derivatives associated with transactions that receive hedge accounting treatment.Southern Company Gas uses derivative instruments primarily to reduce the impact to its results of operations due to the risk of changes in the price of natural gas and, to a lesser extent, Southern Company Gas hedges against warmer-than-normal weather and interest rates. The majority of these contracts are over-the-counter wholesale contracts for the purchase or sale of natural gas or consist of contracts which do not include asset management agreements, financial optionality, or potential embedded derivatives. The fair value of natural gas derivative instruments used to manage exposure to changing natural gas prices reflects the estimated amounts that Southern Company Gas would receive or pay to terminate or close the contracts at the reporting date, taking into account the current unrealized gains or losses on open contracts. For derivatives utilized at gas marketing services and wholesale gas services that are not designated as accounting hedges, changes in fair value are reported as gains or losses in results of operations in the period of change. Gas marketing services records derivative gains or losses arising from cash flow hedges in OCI and reclassifies them into earnings in the same period that the underlying hedged item is recognized in earnings.Derivative assets and liabilities are classified based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment and may affect the valuation of fair value assets and liabilities and their placement within the fair value hierarchy. The determination of the fair value of the derivative instruments incorporates various required factors. These factors include:•the creditworthiness of the counterparties involved and the impact of credit enhancements (such as cash deposits and letters of credit);•events specific to a given counterparty; and•the impact of nonperformance risk on liabilities.A significant change in the underlying market prices or pricing assumptions used in pricing derivative assets or liabilities may result in a significant financial statement impact.Given the assumptions used in pricing the derivative asset or liability, Southern Company and Southern Company Gas consider the valuation of derivative assets and liabilities a critical accounting estimate. See FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY – ""Market Price Risk"" herein and Note 14 to the financial statements for more information.Revenue Recognition (Southern Power)Southern Power's power sale transactions, which include PPAs, are classified in one of four general categories: leases, non-derivatives or normal sale derivatives, derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, and derivatives not designated as hedges. The two categories with the most judgment required for Southern Power are described further below. Southern Power's revenues are dependent upon significant judgments used to determine the appropriate transaction classification, which must be documented upon the inception of each contract.Lease TransactionsSouthern Power considers the terms of a sales contract to determine whether it should be accounted for as a lease. A contract is or contains a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of identified property, plant, or equipment for a period of time in exchange for consideration. If the contract meets the criteria for a lease, Southern Power performs further analysis to determine II-54 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2020 Annual Reportwhether the lease is classified as operating, financing, or sales-type. Generally, all of Southern Power's power sales contracts that are determined to be leases are accounted for as operating leases and the capacity revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract and is included in Southern Power's operating revenues. Energy revenues and other contingent revenues are recognized in the period the energy is delivered or the service is rendered. See Note 9 to the financial statements for additional information.Non-Derivative and Normal Sale Derivative TransactionsIf the power sales contract is not classified as a lease, Southern Power further considers whether the contract meets the definition of a derivative. If the contract does meet the definition of a derivative, Southern Power will assess whether it can be designated as a normal sale contract. The determination of whether a contract can be designated as a normal sale contract requires judgment, including whether the sale of electricity involves physical delivery in quantities within Southern Power's available generating capacity and that the purchaser will take quantities expected to be used or sold in the normal course of business.Contracts that do not meet the definition of a derivative or are designated as normal sales are accounted for as executory contracts. For contracts that have a capacity charge, the revenue is generally recognized in the period that it becomes billable. Revenues related to energy and ancillary services are recognized in the period the energy is delivered or the service is rendered. See Note 4 to the financial statements for additional information.Acquisition Accounting (Southern Power)Southern Power may acquire generation assets as part of its overall growth strategy. At the time of an acquisition, Southern Power will assess if these assets and activities meet the definition of a business. For acquisitions that meet the definition of a business, the purchase price, including any contingent consideration, is allocated based on the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed (including any intangible assets, primarily related to acquired PPAs). Assets acquired that do not meet the definition of a business are accounted for as an asset acquisition. The purchase price of each asset acquisition is allocated based on the relative fair value of assets acquired. Determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management judgment and Southern Power may engage independent valuation experts to assist in this process. Fair values are determined by using market participant assumptions, and typically include the timing and amounts of future cash flows, incurred construction costs, the nature of acquired contracts, discount rates, power market prices, and expected asset lives. Any due diligence or transition costs incurred by Southern Power for potential or successful acquisitions are expensed as incurred.See Note 13 to the financial statements for additional fair value information and Note 15 to the financial statements for additional information on recent acquisitions.Variable Interest Entities (Southern Power)Southern Power enters into partnerships with varying ownership structures. Upon entering into these arrangements, membership interests and other variable interests are evaluated to determine if the legal entity is a VIE. If the legal entity is a VIE, Southern Power will assess if it has both the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE, making it the primary beneficiary. Making this determination may require significant management judgment.If Southern Power is the primary beneficiary and is considered to have a controlling ownership, the assets, liabilities, and results of operations of the entity are consolidated. If Southern Power is not the primary beneficiary, the legal entity is generally accounted for under the equity method of accounting. Southern Power reconsiders its conclusions as to whether the legal entity is a VIE and whether it is the primary beneficiary for events that impact the rights of variable interests, such as ownership changes in membership interests.Southern Power has controlling ownership in certain legal entities for which the contractual provisions represent profit-sharing arrangements because the allocations of cash distributions and tax benefits are not based on fixed ownership percentages. For these arrangements, the noncontrolling interest is accounted for under a balance sheet approach utilizing the HLBV method. The HLBV method calculates each partner's share of income based on the change in net equity the partner can legally claim in a HLBV at the end of the period compared to the beginning of the period.Contingent Obligations (All Registrants)The Registrants are subject to a number of federal and state laws and regulations, as well as other factors and conditions that subject them to environmental, litigation, and other risks. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL herein and Notes 2 and 3 to the financial statements for more information regarding certain of these contingencies. The Registrants periodically evaluate their II-55 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2020 Annual Reportexposure to such risks and record reserves for those matters where a non-tax-related loss is considered probable and reasonably estimable. The adequacy of reserves can be significantly affected by external events or conditions that can be unpredictable; thus, the ultimate outcome of such matters could materially affect the results of operations, cash flows, or financial condition of the Registrants.Recently Issued Accounting StandardsSee Note 1 to the financial statements under ""Recently Adopted Accounting Standards"" for additional information.On March 12, 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting (ASU 2020-04) providing temporary guidance to ease the potential burden in accounting for reference rate reform primarily resulting from the discontinuation of LIBOR, which is currently expected to begin phasing out on December 31, 2021. The amendments in ASU 2020-04 are elective and apply to all entities that have contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions that reference LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued. The new guidance provides the following optional expedients: (i) simplifies accounting analyses under current GAAP for contract modifications; (ii) simplifies the assessment of hedge effectiveness and allows hedging relationships affected by reference rate reform to continue; and (iii) allows a one-time election to sell or transfer debt securities classified as held to maturity that reference a rate affected by reference rate reform. An entity may elect to apply the amendments prospectively from March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022 by accounting topic.The Registrants currently reference LIBOR for certain debt and hedging arrangements. Contract language has been, or is expected to be, incorporated into each of these agreements to address the transition to an alternative rate for agreements that will be in place at the transition date. While existing effective hedging relationships are expected to continue, the Registrants will continue to evaluate the provisions of ASU 2020–04 and the impacts of transitioning to an alternative rate. The ultimate outcome of the transition cannot be determined at this time, but is not expected to have a material impact on the Registrants' financial statements. See FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY – ""Financing Activities"" herein and Note 14 to the financial statements under ""Interest Rate Derivatives"" herein for additional information.FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITYOverviewThe financial condition of each Registrant remained stable at December 31, 2020. The Registrants maintained adequate access to capital throughout 2020, including through a period of volatility in the short-term financial markets during the first quarter 2020 primarily related to the COVID-19 pandemic. As a precautionary measure, in the first quarter 2020, Southern Company, Georgia Power, Mississippi Power, and Southern Company Gas increased their outstanding short-term debt and cash and cash equivalents by entering into new bank term loans, entering into and funding new committed and uncommitted credit facilities, and funding existing uncommitted credit facilities. During the second half of 2020, most of these additional borrowings were repaid. No material changes occurred in the terms of the applicable Registrants' bank credit arrangements or their interest expense on short-term debt as a result of these actions. The Registrants experienced no material counterparty credit losses during 2020 as a result of the volatility in the financial markets during the first half of 2020.The Registrants' cash requirements primarily consist of funding ongoing operations, including unconsolidated subsidiaries, as well as common stock dividends, capital expenditures, and debt maturities. Southern Power's cash requirements also include distributions to noncontrolling interests. Capital expenditures and other investing activities for the traditional electric operating companies include investments to meet projected long-term demand requirements, including to build new generation facilities, to maintain existing generation facilities, to comply with environmental regulations including adding environmental modifications to certain existing generating units and closures of ash ponds, to expand and improve transmission and distribution facilities, and for restoration following major storms. Southern Power's capital expenditures and other investing activities may include acquisitions or new construction associated with its overall growth strategy and to maintain its existing generation fleet's performance. Southern Company Gas' capital expenditures and other investing activities include investments to meet projected long-term demand requirements, to maintain existing natural gas distribution systems as well as to update and expand these systems, and to comply with environmental regulations. See ""Cash Requirements"" herein for additional information.Operating cash flows provide a substantial portion of the Registrants' cash needs. During 2020, Southern Power utilized tax credits, which provided $340 million in operating cash flows. For the three-year period from 2021 through 2023, each Registrant's projected stock dividends, capital expenditures, and debt maturities, as well as distributions to noncontrolling interests for Southern Power, are expected to exceed its operating cash flows. Southern Company plans to finance future cash needs in excess of its operating cash flows primarily by accessing borrowings from financial institutions and issuing debt and hybrid securities in the capital markets. Each Subsidiary Registrant plans to finance its future cash needs in excess of its operating cash flows II-56 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2020 Annual Reportprimarily through external securities issuances, borrowings from financial institutions, and equity contributions from Southern Company. In addition, Georgia Power plans to utilize borrowings through the FFB and Southern Power plans to utilize tax equity partnership contributions. The Registrants plan to use commercial paper to manage seasonal variations in operating cash flows and for other working capital needs and continue to monitor their access to short-term and long-term capital markets as well as their bank credit arrangements to meet future capital and liquidity needs. See ""Sources of Capital"" and ""Financing Activities"" herein for additional information.The Registrants' investments in their qualified pension plans and Alabama Power's and Georgia Power's investments in their nuclear decommissioning trust funds increased in value at December 31, 2020 as compared to December 31, 2019. No contributions to the qualified pension plan were made during 2020 and no mandatory contributions to the qualified pension plans are anticipated during 2021. See Notes 6 and 11 to the financial statements under ""Nuclear Decommissioning"" and ""Pension Plans,"" respectively, for additional information.At the end of 2020, the market price of Southern Company's common stock was $61.43 per share (based on the closing price as reported on the NYSE) and the book value was $26.48 per share, representing a market-to-book value ratio of 232%, compared to $63.70, $26.11, and 244%, respectively, at the end of 2019.Cash RequirementsCapital ExpendituresTotal estimated capital expenditures, including LTSA and nuclear fuel commitments, for the Registrants through 2025 based on their current construction programs are as follows:20212022202320242025(in billions)Southern Company(a)(b)(c)$8.2 $7.0 $7.0 $6.8 $6.7 Alabama Power(a)1.9 1.8 1.7 1.6 1.6 Georgia Power(b)3.8 3.0 3.1 3.1 3.1 Mississippi Power0.3 0.2 0.3 0.3 0.3 Southern Power(c)0.7 0.2 0.2 0.1 0.1 Southern Company Gas1.5 1.7 1.7 1.7 1.6 (a)Includes amounts related to Plant Barry Unit 8. See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Alabama Power"" for additional information.(b)Includes expenditures of approximately $1.3 billion and $0.4 billion for the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 in 2021 and 2022, respectively.(c)Excludes approximately $0.5 billion per year for 2021 through 2025 for Southern Power's planned acquisitions and placeholder growth, which may vary materially due to market opportunities and Southern Power's ability to execute its growth strategy.These capital expenditures include estimates to comply with environmental laws and regulations, but do not include any potential compliance costs associated with any future regulation of CO2 emissions from fossil fuel-fired electric generating units. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – ""Environmental Matters"" herein for additional information. At December 31, 2020, significant purchase commitments were outstanding in connection with the Registrants' construction programs.II-57 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2020 Annual ReportThe traditional electric operating companies also anticipate expenditures associated with closure and monitoring of ash ponds and landfills in accordance with the CCR Rule and the related state rules, which are reflected in the applicable Registrants' ARO liabilities. Alabama Power's cost estimates are based on closure-in-place for all of its ash ponds. The cost estimates for Georgia Power and Mississippi Power are based on a combination of closure-in-place for some ash ponds and closure by removal for others. These anticipated costs are likely to change, and could change materially, as assumptions and details pertaining to closure are refined and compliance activities continue. Current estimates of these costs through 2025 are provided in the table below. Material expenditures in future years for ARO settlements will also be required for ash ponds, nuclear decommissioning (for Alabama Power and Georgia Power), and other liabilities reflected in the applicable Registrants' AROs, as discussed further in Note 6 to the financial statements. Also see FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – ""Environmental Matters – Environmental Laws and Regulations – Coal Combustion Residuals"" herein.20212022202320242025(in millions)Southern Company$585 $759 $957 $903 $931 Alabama Power254 338 412 354 299 Georgia Power287 354 467 498 601 Mississippi Power28 23 23 20 14 The construction programs are subject to periodic review and revision, and actual construction costs may vary from these estimates because of numerous factors. These factors include: changes in business conditions; changes in load projections; changes in environmental laws and regulations; the outcome of any legal challenges to environmental rules; changes in electric generating plants, including unit retirements and replacements and adding or changing fuel sources at existing electric generating units, to meet regulatory requirements; changes in FERC rules and regulations; state regulatory agency approvals; changes in the expected environmental compliance program; changes in legislation; the cost and efficiency of construction labor, equipment, and materials; project scope and design changes; abnormal weather; delays in construction due to judicial or regulatory action; storm impacts; and the cost of capital. The continued COVID-19 pandemic could also impair the ability to develop, construct, and operate facilities, as discussed further in Item 1A herein. In addition, there can be no assurance that costs related to capital expenditures will be fully recovered. Additionally, expenditures associated with Southern Power's planned acquisitions may vary due to market opportunities and the execution of its growth strategy. See Note 15 to the financial statements under ""Southern Power"" for additional information regarding Southern Power's plant acquisitions and construction projects.The construction program of Georgia Power includes Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, which includes components based on new technology that only within the last few years began initial operation in the global nuclear industry at this scale and which may be subject to additional revised cost estimates during construction. See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Georgia Power – Nuclear Construction"" for information regarding Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 and additional factors that may impact construction expenditures.See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – ""Construction Programs"" herein for additional information.Other Significant Cash RequirementsLong-term debt maturities and the interest payable on long-term debt each represent a significant cash requirement for the Registrants. See Note 8 to the financial statements for information regarding the Registrants' long-term debt at December 31, 2020, the weighted average interest rate applicable to each long-term debt category, and a schedule of long-term debt maturities over the next five years. The Registrants plan to continue, when economically feasible, to retire higher-cost securities and replace these obligations with lower-cost capital if market conditions permit.II-58 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2020 Annual ReportFuel and purchased power costs represent a significant component of funding ongoing operations for the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power. See Note 3 to the financial statements under ""Commitments"" for information on Southern Company Gas' commitments for pipeline charges, storage capacity, and gas supply. Total estimated costs for fuel and purchased power commitments at December 31, 2020 for the applicable Registrants are provided in the table below. Fuel costs include purchases of coal (for the traditional electric operating companies) and natural gas (for the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power), as well as the related transportation and storage. In most cases, these contracts contain provisions for price escalation, minimum purchase levels, and other financial commitments. Natural gas purchase commitments are based on various indices at the time of delivery; the amounts reflected below have been estimated based on the NYMEX future prices at December 31, 2020. As discussed under ""Capital Expenditures"" herein, estimated expenditures for nuclear fuel are included in the applicable Registrants' construction programs for the years 2021 through 2025. Nuclear fuel commitments at December 31, 2020 that extend beyond 2025 are included in the table below. Purchased power costs represent estimated minimum obligations for various PPAs for the purchase of capacity and energy, except for those accounted for as leases, which are discussed in Note 9 to the financial statements.20212022202320242025Thereafter(in millions)Southern Company(*)$2,818 $1,831 $883 $705 $659 $5,607 Alabama Power888 643 289 183 171 1,205 Georgia Power(*)1,037 656 339 302 299 3,894 Mississippi Power342 210 115 102 82 502 Southern Power551 322 140 118 107 5 (*)Excludes capacity payments related to Plant Vogtle Units 1 and 2, which are discussed in Note 3 to the financial statements under ""Commitments.""The traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power have entered into LTSAs for the purpose of securing maintenance support for certain of their generating facilities.

Equity capital can be provided from any combination of Southern Company's stock plans, private placements, or public offerings. Southern Company does not expect to issue any equity in the capital markets through 2025. See Note 8 to the financial statements under ""Equity Units"" for information on stock purchase contracts associated with Southern Company's equity units.The Subsidiary Registrants plan to obtain the funds to meet their future capital needs from sources similar to those they used in the past, which were primarily from operating cash flows, external securities issuances, borrowings from financial institutions, and equity contributions from Southern Company. In addition, Georgia Power plans to utilize borrowings from the FFB (as II-59 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2020 Annual Reportdiscussed further in Note 8 to the financial statements under ""Long-term Debt – DOE Loan Guarantee Borrowings"") and Southern Power plans to utilize tax equity partnership contributions (as discussed further herein).At certain periods during 2020, the traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities experienced a reduction in operating cash flows as a result of the temporary suspension of disconnections for non-payment by customers resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and the related overall economic contraction. To date, this reduction of operating cash flows has not had a material impact on the liquidity of any of the Registrants, and, during the third quarter 2020, most of the temporary measures in place expired. The ultimate extent of the negative impact on the Registrants' liquidity depends on the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and any federal, state, or local response and cannot be determined at this time. See Note 2 to the financial statements for information regarding suspended disconnections for non-payment by the traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities.The amount, type, and timing of any financings in 2021, as well as in subsequent years, will be contingent on investment opportunities and the Registrants' capital requirements and will depend upon prevailing market conditions, regulatory approvals (for certain of the Subsidiary Registrants), and other factors. See ""Cash Requirements"" herein for additional information.Southern Power utilizes tax equity partnerships as one of its financing sources, where the tax partner takes significantly all of the federal tax benefits. These tax equity partnerships are consolidated in Southern Power's financial statements and are accounted for using HLBV methodology to allocate partnership gains and losses. During 2020, Southern Power obtained tax equity funding for the Reading and Skookumchuck wind projects and received proceeds totaling $277 million. In addition, Southern Power received tax equity funding totaling $16 million from existing partnerships. See Notes 1 and 15 to the financial statements under ""General"" and ""Southern Power,"" respectively, for additional information.The issuance of securities by the traditional electric operating companies and Nicor Gas is generally subject to the approval of the applicable state PSC or other applicable state regulatory agency. The issuance of all securities by Mississippi Power and short-term securities by Georgia Power is generally subject to regulatory approval by the FERC. Additionally, with respect to the public offering of securities, Southern Company, the traditional electric operating companies, and Southern Power (excluding its subsidiaries), Southern Company Gas Capital, and Southern Company Gas (excluding its other subsidiaries) file registration statements with the SEC under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (1933 Act). The amounts of securities authorized by the appropriate regulatory authorities, as well as the securities registered under the 1933 Act, are closely monitored and appropriate filings are made to ensure flexibility in the capital markets.The Registrants generally obtain financing separately without credit support from any affiliate. See Note 8 to the financial statements under ""Bank Credit Arrangements"" for additional information. The Southern Company system does not maintain a centralized cash or money pool. Therefore, funds of each company are not commingled with funds of any other company in the Southern Company system, except in the case of Southern Company Gas, as described below.The traditional electric operating companies and SEGCO may utilize a Southern Company subsidiary organized to issue and sell commercial paper at their request and for their benefit. Proceeds from such issuances for the benefit of an individual company are loaned directly to that company. The obligations of each traditional electric operating company and SEGCO under these arrangements are several and there is no cross-affiliate credit support. Alabama Power also maintains its own separate commercial paper program.Southern Company Gas Capital obtains external financing for Southern Company Gas and its subsidiaries, other than Nicor Gas, which obtains financing separately without credit support from any affiliates. Southern Company Gas maintains commercial paper programs at Southern Company Gas Capital and Nicor Gas. Nicor Gas' commercial paper program supports its working capital needs as Nicor Gas is not permitted to make money pool loans to affiliates. All of the other Southern Company Gas subsidiaries benefit from Southern Company Gas Capital's commercial paper program.By regulation, Nicor Gas is restricted, to the extent of its retained earnings balance, in the amount it can dividend or loan to affiliates and is not permitted to make money pool loans to affiliates. At December 31, 2020, the amount of subsidiary retained earnings restricted to dividend totaled $1.1 billion. This restriction did not impact Southern Company Gas' ability to meet its cash obligations, nor does management expect such restriction to materially impact Southern Company Gas' ability to meet its currently anticipated cash obligations.II-60 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2020 Annual ReportCertain Registrants' current liabilities frequently exceed their current assets because of long-term debt maturities and the periodic use of short-term debt as a funding source, as well as significant seasonal fluctuations in cash needs. The Registrants generally plan to refinance long-term debt as it matures. See Note 8 to the financial statements for additional information.

These contracts are primarily for physical electricity and natural gas purchases and sales, fuel purchases, fuel transportation and storage, energy price risk management, transmission, interest rate management, and, for Georgia Power, construction of new generation at Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4.The maximum potential collateral requirements under these contracts at December 31, 2020 were as follows:Credit RatingsSouthern Company(*)Alabama PowerGeorgia PowerMississippi PowerSouthernPower(*)Southern Company Gas(in millions)At BBB and/or Baa2$36 $1 $— $— $35 $— At BBB- and/or Baa3416 2 61 1 355 — At BB+ and/or Ba1 or below1,929 366 958 313 1,201 12 (*)Southern Power has PPAs that could require collateral, but not accelerated payment, in the event of a downgrade of Southern Power's credit. The PPAs require credit assurances without stating a specific credit rating. The amount of collateral required would depend upon actual losses resulting from a credit downgrade. Southern Power had $105 million of cash collateral posted related to PPA requirements at December 31, 2020. The amounts in the previous table for the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power include certain agreements that could require collateral if either Alabama Power or Georgia Power has a credit rating change to below investment grade. Generally, collateral may be provided by a Southern Company guaranty, letter of credit, or cash. Additionally, a credit rating downgrade could impact the ability of the Registrants to access capital markets and would be likely to impact the cost at which they do so.Mississippi Power and its largest retail customer, Chevron, have agreements under which Mississippi Power continues to provide retail service to the Chevron refinery in Pascagoula, Mississippi through 2038. The agreements grant Chevron a security interest in the co-generation assets owned by Mississippi Power located at the refinery that is exercisable upon the occurrence of (i) certain bankruptcy events or (ii) other events of default coupled with specific reductions in steam output at the facility and a downgrade of Mississippi Power's credit rating to below investment grade by two of the three rating agencies.On August 27, 2020, Moody's upgraded Mississippi Power's senior unsecured long-term debt rating to Baa1 from Baa2 and revised its rating outlook to stable from positive.On September 25, 2020, Fitch upgraded Mississippi Power's senior unsecured long-term debt rating to A- from BBB+ and revised its rating outlook to stable from positive.Also on September 25, 2020, Fitch revised the ratings outlook of Southern Company and its subsidiaries (excluding Georgia Power and Mississippi Power) to stable from negative.Market Price RiskThe Registrants had no material change in market risk exposure for the year ended December 31, 2020 when compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. See Note 14 to the financial statements for an in-depth discussion of the Registrants' derivatives, as well as Note 1 to the financial statements under ""Financial Instruments"" for additional information.II-70 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2020 Annual ReportDue to cost-based rate regulation and other various cost recovery mechanisms, the traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities that sell natural gas directly to end-use customers continue to have limited exposure to market volatility in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, commodity fuel prices, and prices of electricity. The traditional electric operating companies and certain of the natural gas distribution utilities manage fuel-hedging programs implemented per the guidelines of their respective state PSCs or other applicable state regulatory agencies to hedge the impact of market fluctuations in natural gas prices for customers. Mississippi Power also manages wholesale fuel-hedging programs under agreements with its wholesale customers. Because energy from Southern Power's facilities is primarily sold under long-term PPAs with tolling agreements and provisions shifting substantially all of the responsibility for fuel cost to the counterparties, Southern Power's exposure to market volatility in commodity fuel prices and prices of electricity is generally limited. However, Southern Power has been and may continue to be exposed to market volatility in energy-related commodity prices as a result of uncontracted generating capacity. To mitigate residual risks relative to movements in electricity prices, the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power may enter into physical fixed-price contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity through the wholesale electricity market and, to a lesser extent, financial hedge contracts for natural gas purchases; however, a significant portion of contracts are priced at market.Certain of Southern Company Gas' non-regulated operations routinely utilize various types of derivative instruments to economically hedge certain commodity price and weather risks inherent in the natural gas industry. These instruments include a variety of exchange-traded and OTC energy contracts, such as forward contracts, futures contracts, options contracts, and swap agreements. Southern Company Gas' gas marketing services and wholesale gas services businesses also actively manage storage positions through a variety of hedging transactions for the purpose of managing exposures arising from changing natural gas prices. These hedging instruments are used to substantially protect economic margins (as spreads between wholesale and retail natural gas prices widen between periods) and thereby minimize exposure to declining operating margins. Some of these economic hedge activities may not qualify, or may not be designated, for hedge accounting treatment.The following table provides information related to variable interest rate exposure on long-term debt (including amounts due within one year) at December 31, 2020 for the applicable Registrants:At December 31, 2020Southern Company(*)AlabamaPowerGeorgiaPowerMississippiPower(in millions, except percentages)Long-term variable interest rate exposure$3,428 $1,079 $675 $74 Weighted average interest rate on long-term variable interest rate exposure0.77 %0.76 %0.23 %0.70 %Impact on annualized interest expense of 100 basis point change in interest rates$34 $11 $7 $1 (*)Includes $1.5 billion of long-term variable interest rate exposure at the Southern Company parent entity.The Registrants may enter into interest rate derivatives designated as hedges, which are intended to mitigate interest rate volatility related to forecasted debt financings and existing fixed and floating rate obligations. See Note 14 to the financial statements under ""Interest Rate Derivatives"" for additional information.Southern Power had foreign currency denominated debt of €1.1 billion at December 31, 2020. Southern Power has mitigated its exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk through the use of foreign currency swaps converting all interest and principal payments to fixed-rate U.S. dollars. See Note 14 to the financial statements under ""Foreign Currency Derivatives"" for additional information.II-71 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2020 Annual ReportChanges in fair value of energy-related derivative contracts for Southern Company and Southern Company Gas for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 are provided in the table below. The fair value of energy-related derivative contracts was not material for the other Registrants. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, substantially all of the traditional electric operating companies' and certain of the natural gas distribution utilities' energy-related derivative contracts were designated as regulatory hedges and were related to the applicable company's fuel-hedging program.Southern Company(a)Southern Company Gas(a)(in millions)Contracts outstanding at December 31, 2018, assets (liabilities), net$(201)$(167)Contracts realized or settled69 26 Current period changes(b)105 213 Disposition6 — Contracts outstanding at December 31, 2019, assets (liabilities), net$(21)$72 Contracts realized or settled(14)(98)Current period changes(b)142 127 Contracts outstanding at December 31, 2020, assets (liabilities), net$107 $101 (a)Excludes cash collateral held on deposit in broker margin accounts of $28 million, $99 million, and $277 million at December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively, and premium and intrinsic value associated with weather derivatives of $6 million, $4 million, and $8 million at December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.(b)The changes in fair value of energy-related derivative contracts are substantially attributable to both the volume and the price of natural gas. Current period changes also include the changes in fair value of new contracts entered into during the period, if any.The net hedge volumes of energy-related derivative contracts for natural gas purchased (sold) at December 31, 2020 and 2019 for Southern Company and Southern Company Gas were as follows:Southern CompanySouthern Company GasmmBtu Volume (in millions)At December 31, 2020:Commodity – Natural gas swaps262 — Commodity – Natural gas options574 523 Total hedge volume836 523 At December 31, 2019:Commodity – Natural gas swaps327 — Commodity – Natural gas options262 218 Total hedge volume589 218 Southern Company Gas' derivative contracts are comprised of both long and short natural gas positions. A long position is a contract to purchase natural gas, and a short position is a contract to sell natural gas. The volumes presented above for Southern Company Gas represent the net of long natural gas positions of 4.42 billion mmBtu and short natural gas positions of 3.90 billion mmBtu at December 31, 2020 and the net of long natural gas positions of 4.10 billion mmBtu and short natural gas positions of 3.88 billion mmBtu at December 31, 2019.For the Southern Company system, the weighted average swap contract cost per mmBtu was equal to market prices at December 31, 2020 and was approximately $0.28 per mmBtu above market prices at December 31, 2019. The change in option fair value is primarily attributable to the volatility of the market and the underlying change in the natural gas price. Substantially all of the traditional electric operating companies' natural gas hedge gains and losses are recovered through their respective fuel cost recovery clauses.II-72 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2020 Annual ReportThe Registrants use over-the-counter contracts that are not exchange traded but are fair valued using prices which are market observable, and thus fall into Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. In addition, Southern Company Gas uses exchange-traded market-observable contracts, which are categorized as Level 1, and contracts that include a combination of observable and unobservable components, which are categorized as Level 3. See Note 13 to the financial statements for further discussion of fair value measurements. The maturities of the energy-related derivative contracts for Southern Company and Southern Company Gas at December 31, 2020 were as follows:Fair Value Measurements of Contracts atDecember 31, 2020TotalFair ValueMaturity20212022 – 20232024 – 2025(in millions)Southern CompanyLevel 1(a)$13 $10 $(11)$14 Level 2(b)66 49 5 12 Level 328 9 8 11 Southern Company total(c)$107 $68 $2 $37 Southern Company GasLevel 1(a)$13 $10 $(11)$14 Level 2(b)60 43 5 12 Level 328 9 8 11 Southern Company Gas total(c)$101 $62 $2 $37 (a)Valued using NYMEX futures prices.(b)Level 2 amounts for Southern Company Gas are valued using basis transactions that represent the cost to transport natural gas from a NYMEX delivery point to the contract delivery point. These transactions are based on quotes obtained either through electronic trading platforms or directly from brokers.(c)Excludes cash collateral of $28 million as well as premium and associated intrinsic value associated with weather derivatives of $6 million at December 31, 2020.The Registrants are exposed to risk in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to energy-related and interest rate derivative contracts, as applicable. The Registrants only enter into agreements and material transactions with counterparties that have investment grade credit ratings by Moody's and S&P, or with counterparties who have posted collateral to cover potential credit exposure. Therefore, the Registrants do not anticipate market risk exposure from nonperformance by the counterparties. For additional information, see Note 1 to the financial statements under ""Financial Instruments"" and Note 14 to the financial statements.Southern Company performs periodic reviews of its leveraged lease transactions, both domestic and international, and the creditworthiness of the lessees, including a review of the value of the underlying leased assets and the credit ratings of the lessees. Southern Company's domestic lease transactions generally do not have any credit enhancement mechanisms; however, the lessees in its international lease transactions have pledged various deposits as additional security to secure the obligations. The lessees in Southern Company's international lease transactions are also required to provide additional collateral in the event of a credit downgrade below a certain level. See Notes 1 and 3 to the financial statements under ""Leveraged Leases"" and ""Other Matters – Southern Company,"" respectively, for additional information, including recent impairment charges related to certain leveraged lease investments.Southern Company Gas Value at Risk (VaR)VaR is the maximum potential loss in portfolio value over a specified time period that is not expected to be exceeded within a given degree of probability. Southern Company Gas' VaR may not be comparable to that of other companies due to differences in the factors used to calculate VaR. Southern Company Gas' VaR is determined on a 95% confidence interval and a one-day holding period, which means that 95% of the time, the risk of loss in a day from a portfolio of positions is expected to be less than or equal to the amount of VaR calculated. The open exposure of Southern Company Gas is managed in accordance with established policies that limit market risk and require daily reporting of potential financial exposure to senior management. Because Southern Company Gas generally manages physical gas assets and economically protects its positions by hedging in the II-73 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2020 Annual Reportfutures markets, Southern Company Gas' open exposure is generally mitigated. Southern Company Gas employs daily risk testing, using both VaR and stress testing, to evaluate the risk of its positions.Southern Company Gas actively monitors open commodity positions and the resulting VaR and maintains a relatively small risk exposure as total buy volume is close to sell volume, with minimal open natural gas price risk. Based on a 95% confidence interval and employing a one-day holding period, SouthStar's portfolio of positions for all periods presented was immaterial. Southern Company Gas' wholesale gas services segment had the following VaRs at December 31:202020192018(in millions)Period end(*)$1.3 $2.6 $6.4 Average2.5 3.4 3.7 High(*)4.6 7.0 11.7 Low1.2 2.1 1.2 (*)The VaR at December 31, 2018 reflects significant natural gas price increases in Sequent's key markets driven by an industry-wide lower-than-normal natural gas storage inventory position and colder-than-normal weather in the middle of fourth quarter 2018. As weather and natural gas prices moderated subsequent to December 31, 2018, VaR declined.Credit RiskSouthern Company (except as discussed herein), the traditional electric operating companies, and Southern Power are not exposed to any concentrations of credit risk. Southern Company Gas' exposure to concentrations of credit risk is discussed herein.Southern Company GasGas Distribution OperationsConcentration of credit risk occurs at Atlanta Gas Light for amounts billed for services and other costs to its customers, which consist of the 16 Marketers in Georgia. The credit risk exposure to the Marketers varies seasonally, with the lowest exposure in the non-peak summer months and the highest exposure in the peak winter months. Marketers are responsible for the retail sale of natural gas to end-use customers in Georgia. The provisions of Atlanta Gas Light's tariff allow Atlanta Gas Light to obtain credit security support in an amount equal to a minimum of two times a Marketer's highest month's estimated bill from Atlanta Gas Light. For 2020, the four largest Marketers based on customer count, which includes SouthStar, accounted for 21% of Southern Company Gas' adjusted operating margin and 25% of adjusted operating margin for Southern Company Gas' gas distribution operations segment.Several factors are designed to mitigate Southern Company Gas' risks from the increased concentration of credit that has resulted from deregulation. In addition to the security support described above, Atlanta Gas Light bills intrastate delivery service to Marketers in advance rather than in arrears. Atlanta Gas Light accepts credit support in the form of cash deposits, letters of credit/surety bonds from acceptable issuers, and corporate guarantees from investment-grade entities. Southern Company Gas reviews the adequacy of credit support coverage, credit rating profiles of credit support providers, and payment status of each Marketer. Southern Company Gas believes that adequate policies and procedures are in place to properly quantify, manage, and report on Atlanta Gas Light's credit risk exposure to Marketers.Atlanta Gas Light also faces potential credit risk in connection with assignments of interstate pipeline transportation and storage capacity to Marketers. Although Atlanta Gas Light assigns this capacity to Marketers, in the event that a Marketer fails to pay the interstate pipelines for the capacity, the interstate pipelines would likely seek repayment from Atlanta Gas Light.Wholesale Gas ServicesSouthern Company Gas has established credit policies to determine and monitor the creditworthiness of counterparties, including requirements to post collateral or other credit security, as well as the quality of pledged collateral. Southern Company Gas also utilizes netting agreements whenever possible to mitigate exposure to counterparty credit risk. When more than one derivative transaction with the same counterparty is outstanding and a legally enforceable netting agreement exists with that counterparty, the ""net"" mark-to-market exposure represents a reasonable measure of Southern Company Gas' credit risk with that counterparty. Netting agreements also enable Southern Company Gas to net certain assets and liabilities by counterparty across product lines and against cash collateral, provided the netting and cash collateral agreements include such provisions. While the amounts due from, or owed to, counterparties are settled net, they are recorded on a gross basis on the balance sheet as energy marketing receivables and energy marketing payables.II-74 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2020 Annual ReportSouthern Company Gas may require counterparties to pledge additional collateral when deemed necessary. Collateral or credit security is most often in the form of cash or letters of credit from an investment-grade financial institution but may also include cash or U.S. government securities held by a trustee. Southern Company Gas conducts credit evaluations and obtains appropriate internal approvals for a counterparty's line of credit before any transaction with the counterparty is executed. In most cases, the counterparty must have an investment grade rating, which includes a minimum long-term debt rating of Baa3 from Moody's and BBB- from S&P. Generally, Southern Company Gas requires credit enhancements by way of a guaranty, cash deposit, or letter of credit for transaction counterparties that do not have investment grade ratings. Certain of Southern Company Gas' derivative instruments contain credit-risk-related or other contingent features that could increase the payments for collateral it posts in the normal course of business when its financial instruments are in net liability positions. At December 31, 2020, for agreements with such features, Southern Company Gas' derivative instruments with liability fair values were immaterial and Southern Company Gas had no collateral posted with derivatives counterparties to satisfy these arrangements.Southern Company Gas has a concentration of credit risk as measured by its 30-day receivable exposure plus forward exposure. At December 31, 2020, the top 20 counterparties of Southern Company Gas' wholesale gas services segment represented approximately 58%, or $234 million, of its total counterparty exposure and had a weighted average S&P equivalent credit rating of A-, all of which is consistent with the prior year. The S&P equivalent credit rating is determined by a process of converting the lower of the S&P or Moody's ratings to an internal rating ranging from 9 to 1, with 9 being equivalent to AAA/Aaa by S&P and Moody's, respectively, and 1 being D / Default by S&P and Moody's, respectively. A counterparty that does not have an external rating is assigned an internal rating based on the strength of the financial ratios of that counterparty. To arrive at the weighted average credit rating, each counterparty is assigned an internal ratio, which is multiplied by their credit exposure and summed for all counterparties. The sum is divided by the aggregate total counterparties' exposures, and this numeric value is then converted to a S&P equivalent.The following table provides credit risk information related to Southern Company Gas' third-party natural gas contracts receivable and payable positions at December 31:Gross ReceivablesGross Payables2020201920202019(in millions)(in millions)Netting agreements in place:Counterparty is investment grade$265 $238 $104 $127 Counterparty is non-investment grade3 1 46 43 Counterparty has no external rating235 175 342 272 No netting agreements in place:Counterparty is investment grade13 14 2 — Amount recorded in balance sheets$516 $428 $494 $442 Gas Marketing ServicesSouthern Company Gas obtains credit scores for its firm residential and small commercial customers using a national credit reporting agency, enrolling only those customers that meet or exceed Southern Company Gas' credit threshold. Southern Company Gas considers potential interruptible and large commercial customers based on reviews of publicly available financial statements and commercially available credit reports. Prior to entering into a physical transaction, Southern Company Gas also assigns physical wholesale counterparties an internal credit rating and credit limit based on the counterparties' Moody's, S&P, and Fitch ratings, commercially available credit reports, and audited financial statements.II-75 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements",2023-12-30 19:50:10.868245

Also see Notes 13 and 14 to the financial statements in Item 8 herein.II-2 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISSouthern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual ReportOVERVIEWBusiness ActivitiesSouthern Company is a holding company that owns all of the common stock of three traditional electric operating companies, Southern Power, and Southern Company Gas and owns other direct and indirect subsidiaries. The primary businesses of the Southern Company system are electricity sales by the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power and the distribution of natural gas by Southern Company Gas. Southern Company's reportable segments are the sale of electricity by the traditional electric operating companies, the sale of electricity in the competitive wholesale market by Southern Power, and the sale of natural gas and other complementary products and services by Southern Company Gas. See Note 16 to the financial statements for additional information.•The traditional electric operating companies – Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and Mississippi Power – are vertically integrated utilities providing electric service to retail customers in three Southeastern states in addition to wholesale customers in the Southeast.•Southern Power develops, constructs, acquires, owns, and manages power generation assets, including renewable energy projects, and sells electricity at market-based rates in the wholesale market. Southern Power continually seeks opportunities to execute its strategy to create value through various transactions including acquisitions, dispositions, and sales of partnership interests, development and construction of new generating facilities, and entry into PPAs primarily with investor-owned utilities, IPPs, municipalities, electric cooperatives, and other load-serving entities, as well as commercial and industrial customers. In general, Southern Power commits to the construction or acquisition of new generating capacity only after entering into or assuming long-term PPAs for the new facilities.•Southern Company Gas is an energy services holding company whose primary business is the distribution of natural gas. Southern Company Gas owns natural gas distribution utilities in four states – Illinois, Georgia, Virginia, and Tennessee – and is also involved in several other complementary businesses. Southern Company Gas manages its business through three reportable segments – gas distribution operations, gas pipeline investments, and gas marketing services, which includes SouthStar, a Marketer and provider of energy-related products and services to natural gas markets – and one non-reportable segment, all other. Prior to the sale of Sequent on July 1, 2021, Southern Company Gas' reportable segments also included wholesale gas services. See Notes 7, 15, and 16 to the financial statements for additional information.Southern Company's other business activities include providing distributed energy and resilience solutions and deploying microgrids for commercial, industrial, governmental, and utility customers, as well as investments in telecommunications and gas storage facilities. Management continues to evaluate the contribution of each of these activities to total shareholder return and may pursue acquisitions, dispositions, and other strategic ventures or investments accordingly.See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL herein for a discussion of the many factors that could impact the Registrants' future results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.Recent DevelopmentsSouthern CompanyOn October 29, 2021, Southern Company completed the sale of assets subject to a domestic leveraged lease to the lessee for $45 million. No gain or loss was recognized on the sale. On December 13, 2021, Southern Company completed the termination of its leasehold interest in assets associated with its two international leveraged lease projects and received cash proceeds of approximately $673 million after the accelerated exercise of the lessee's purchase options. The pre-tax gain associated with the transaction was approximately $93 million ($99 million gain after tax). See Note 15 to the financial statements under ""Southern Company"" for additional information.Alabama PowerOn September 23, 2021, Alabama Power entered into an agreement to acquire all of the equity interests in Calhoun Power Company, LLC, which owns and operates a 743-MW winter peak, simple-cycle, combustion turbine generation facility in Calhoun County, Alabama (Calhoun Generating Station). The completion of the acquisition is subject to the satisfaction and waiver of certain conditions, including, among other customary conditions, approval by the Alabama PSC and the FERC. On October 28, 2021, Alabama Power filed a petition for a CCN with the Alabama PSC to procure additional generating capacity through this acquisition. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.II-3 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual ReportDuring 2021, Alabama Power continued construction of Plant Barry Unit 8. At December 31, 2021, associated project expenditures included in CWIP totaled approximately $304 million.For the year ended December 31, 2021, Alabama Power's weighted common equity return exceeded 6.15%, resulting in Alabama Power establishing a current regulatory liability of $181 million. In accordance with an Alabama PSC order issued on February 1, 2022, Alabama Power will apply $126 million to reduce the Rate ECR under recovered balance and the remaining $55 million will be refunded to customers through bill credits in July 2022.See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Alabama Power"" for additional information.Georgia PowerPlant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 Construction and Start-Up StatusConstruction continues on Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 (with electric generating capacity of approximately 1,100 MWs each), in which Georgia Power holds a 45.7% ownership interest. Georgia Power's share of the total project capital cost forecast to complete Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, including contingency, through the end of the first quarter 2023 and the fourth quarter 2023, respectively, is $10.4 billion.Georgia Power estimates the productivity impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic have consumed approximately three to four months of schedule margin previously embedded in the site work plan for Unit 3 and Unit 4. The continuing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic could further disrupt or delay construction and testing activities at Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4.During 2021, Southern Nuclear performed additional construction remediation work necessary to ensure quality and design standards are met and support system turnovers necessary for Unit 3 hot functional testing, which was completed in July 2021, and fuel load. As a result of Unit 3 challenges including, but not limited to, construction productivity, construction remediation work, the pace of system turnovers, spent fuel pool repairs, and the timeframe and duration for hot functional and other testing, at the end of each of the second and third quarters 2021, Southern Nuclear further extended certain milestone dates, including fuel load for Unit 3, from those established in January 2021. Through the fourth quarter 2021, the project continued to face these and other challenges related to the completion of documentation, including inspection records, necessary to submit the remaining ITAACs and begin fuel load. As a result, at the end of the fourth quarter 2021, Southern Nuclear further extended certain milestone dates, including fuel load for Unit 3, from those established at the end of the third quarter 2021. The site work plan currently targets fuel load for Unit 3 in the second quarter 2022 and an in-service date during the third quarter 2022 and primarily depends on significant improvements in overall construction productivity and production levels, the volume of construction remediation work, the pace of system and area turnovers, and the progression of startup and other testing. As the site work plan includes minimal margin to these milestone dates, an in-service date during the fourth quarter 2022 or the first quarter 2023 for Unit 3 is projected, although any further delays could result in a later in-service date.As the result of productivity challenges and temporarily diverting some Unit 4 craft and support resources to Unit 3 construction efforts, at the end of each of the second and third quarters 2021, Southern Nuclear also further extended milestone dates for Unit 4 from those established in January 2021. The temporary diversion of Unit 4 resources to support Unit 3 has continued into the first quarter 2022; therefore, at the end of the fourth quarter 2021, Southern Nuclear further extended milestone dates for Unit 4 from those established at the end of the third quarter 2021. The site work plan targets an in-service date during the first quarter 2023 for Unit 4 and primarily depends on overall construction productivity and production levels significantly improving as well as appropriate levels of craft laborers, particularly electricians and pipefitters, being added and maintained. As the site work plan includes minimal margin to the milestone dates, an in-service date during the third or fourth quarter 2023 for Unit 4 is projected, although any further delays could result in a later in-service date.The latest schedule extension triggers the requirement that the holders of at least 90% of the ownership interests in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 must vote to continue construction by March 8, 2022. Georgia Power has voted to continue construction. In addition, if the holders of at least 90% of the ownership interests of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 do not vote to continue construction, the DOE may require Georgia Power to prepay all outstanding borrowings under the FFB Credit Facilities over a period of five years. See Note 8 to the financial statements under ""Long-term Debt – DOE Loan Guarantee Borrowings"" for additional information.During 2021, established construction contingency and additional costs totaling $1.3 billion were assigned to the base capital cost forecast for costs primarily associated with schedule extensions, construction productivity, the pace of system turnovers, and support resources for Units 3 and 4. Georgia Power also increased its total capital cost forecast as of December 31, 2021 by $99 million to replenish construction contingency.II-4 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual ReportAfter considering the significant level of uncertainty that exists regarding the future recoverability of these costs since the ultimate outcome of these matters is subject to the outcome of future assessments by management, as well as Georgia PSC decisions in future regulatory proceedings, Georgia Power recorded pre-tax charges to income in the first quarter 2021, the second quarter 2021, the third quarter 2021, and the fourth quarter 2021 of $48 million ($36 million after tax), $460 million ($343 million after tax), $264 million ($197 million after tax), and $480 million ($358 million after tax), respectively, for the increases in the total project capital cost forecast. Georgia Power may request the Georgia PSC to evaluate those expenditures for rate recovery during the prudence review following the Unit 4 fuel load pursuant to the twenty-fourth VCM stipulation described in Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Georgia Power – Nuclear Construction – Regulatory Matters."" In addition, Georgia Power recorded a pre-tax charge to income in the fourth quarter 2021 of approximately $440 million ($328 million after tax), and may be required to record additional pre-tax charges to income of up to $460 million, associated with the cost-sharing and tender provisions of the joint ownership agreements based on the current project capital cost forecast. The incremental costs associated with these provisions will not be recovered from retail customers. See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Georgia Power – Nuclear Construction – Joint Owner Contracts"" for additional information.The ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and other factors on the construction schedule and budget for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 cannot be determined at this time. See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Georgia Power – Nuclear Construction"" for additional information.Plant Vogtle Unit 3 and Common Facilities Rate ProceedingOn November 2, 2021, the Georgia PSC approved Georgia Power's application to adjust retail base rates to include a portion of costs related to its investment in Plant Vogtle Unit 3 and the common facilities shared between Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 (Common Facilities), as well as the related costs of operation, as modified pursuant to a stipulated agreement between Georgia Power and the staff of the Georgia PSC. The related increase in annual retail base rates of approximately $302 million includes recovery of all projected operations and maintenance expenses for Unit 3 and the Common Facilities and other related costs of operation, partially offset by the related production tax credits, and will become effective the month after Unit 3 is placed in service. This increase is partially offset by a decrease in the NCCR tariff of approximately $78 million that became effective January 1, 2022. See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Georgia Power – Plant Vogtle Unit 3 and Common Facilities Rate Proceeding"" for additional information.Rate PlansOn November 18, 2021, in accordance with the terms of the 2019 ARP, the Georgia PSC approved tariff adjustments effective January 1, 2022 resulting in a net increase in annual retail base rates of $157 million. Georgia Power is required to file its next general base rate case by July 1, 2022. See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Georgia Power – Rate Plans – 2019 ARP"" for additional information.Integrated Resource PlanOn January 31, 2022, Georgia Power filed its triennial IRP (2022 IRP), including a request to decertify and retire Plant Wansley Units 1 and 2 (926 MWs based on 53.5% ownership) by August 31, 2022; Plant Bowen Units 1 and 2 (1,400 MWs) by December 31, 2027; and Plant Scherer Unit 3 (614 MWs based on 75% ownership) and Plant Gaston Units 1 through 4 (500 MWs based on 50% ownership through SEGCO) by December 31, 2028.In the 2022 IRP, Georgia Power requested approval to reclassify the remaining net book value of Plant Wansley Units 1 and 2 (approximately $611 million at December 31, 2021), Plant Bowen Units 1 and 2 (approximately $937 million at December 31, 2021), and Plant Scherer Unit 3 (approximately $612 million at December 31, 2021) and any remaining unusable materials and supplies inventories upon each unit's respective retirement dates to a regulatory asset, with recovery periods to be determined in future base rate cases.The 2022 IRP also included a request for approval of the capital, operations and maintenance, and CCR ARO costs associated with ash pond and landfill closures and post-closure care. The recovery of these costs is expected to be determined in future base rate cases.A decision from the Georgia PSC on the 2022 IRP is expected in July 2022. The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time. See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Georgia Power – Integrated Resource Plan"" for additional information.II-5 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual ReportMississippi PowerDuring the first half of 2021, the Mississippi PSC approved the following non-fuel rate changes related to Mississippi Power's annual rate filings for 2021:•an increase in revenues related to the ad valorem tax adjustment factor of approximately $28 million annually, which became effective with the first billing cycle of May 2021,•an increase in revenues related to PEP of approximately $16 million annually, which became effective with the first billing cycle of April 2021 in accordance with the PEP rate schedule, and•a decrease in revenues related to the ECO Plan of approximately $9 million annually, which became effective with the first billing cycle of July 2021.On September 9, 2021, the Mississippi PSC issued an order confirming the conclusion of its review of Mississippi Power's 2021 IRP with no deficiencies identified. The 2021 IRP included a schedule to retire Plant Watson Unit 4 (268 MWs) and Mississippi Power's 40% ownership interest in Plant Greene County Units 1 and 2 (103 MWs each) in December 2023, 2025, and 2026, respectively, consistent with each unit's remaining useful life in the most recent approved depreciation studies. In addition, the schedule reflects the early retirement of Mississippi Power's 50% undivided ownership interest in Plant Daniel Units 1 and 2 (502 MWs) by the end of 2027.In accordance with an accounting order issued by the Mississippi PSC on October 14, 2021, Mississippi Power reclassified $49 million of retail costs associated with Hurricanes Zeta and Ida to a regulatory asset to be recovered through PEP over a period to be determined in Mississippi Power's 2022 PEP proceeding. In addition, on December 7, 2021, the Mississippi PSC approved Mississippi Power's annual SRR filing, which requested an increase in retail revenues of approximately $9 million annually effective with the first billing cycle of March 2022 to restore the property damage reserve.On January 18, 2022, the Mississippi PSC approved Mississippi Power's retail fuel cost recovery filing, which requested an increase in revenues of approximately $43 million annually effective with the first billing cycle of February 2022.See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Mississippi Power"" for additional information.Southern PowerDuring 2021, Southern Power completed construction of and placed in service the 118-MW Glass Sands wind facility, 73 MWs of the 88-MW Garland battery energy storage facility, and 32 MWs of the 72-MW Tranquillity battery energy storage facility. Southern Power continues construction of the remainder of the Garland and Tranquillity battery energy storage facilities. On March 26, 2021, Southern Power purchased a controlling membership interest in the 300-MW Deuel Harvest wind facility located in Deuel County, South Dakota from Invenergy Renewables LLC.Southern Power calculates an investment coverage ratio for its generating assets, including those owned with various partners, based on the ratio of investment under contract to total investment using the respective facilities' net book value (or expected in-service value for facilities under construction) as the investment amount. With the inclusion of investments associated with the facilities currently under construction, as well as other capacity and energy contracts, Southern Power's average investment coverage ratio at December 31, 2021 was 95% through 2026 and 92% through 2031, with an average remaining contract duration of approximately 13 years.See Note 15 to the financial statements under ""Southern Power"" for additional information.Southern Company GasOn April 28, 2021, Atlanta Gas Light filed its first Integrated Capacity and Delivery Plan (i-CDP) with the Georgia PSC, which includes a series of ongoing and proposed pipeline safety, reliability, and growth programs for the next 10 years, as well as the required capital investments and related costs to implement the programs. On November 18, 2021, the Georgia PSC approved an October 14, 2021 joint stipulation agreement between Atlanta Gas Light and the staff of the Georgia PSC, under which, for the years 2022 through 2024, Atlanta Gas Light will incrementally reduce its combined GRAM and System Reinforcement Rider request by 10% through Atlanta Gas Light's GRAM mechanism, or $5 million for 2022. The stipulation agreement also provides for $1.7 billion of total capital investment for the years 2022 through 2024.Also on November 18, 2021, the Georgia PSC approved Atlanta Gas Light's amended annual GRAM filing, which resulted in an annual rate increase of $43 million effective January 1, 2022.II-6 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual ReportOn September 14, 2021, the Virginia Commission approved a stipulation agreement related to Virginia Natural Gas' June 2020 general rate case filing, which allows for a $43 million increase in annual base rate revenues, including $14 million related to the recovery of investments under the SAVE program, based on a ROE of 9.5% and an equity ratio of 51.9%. Interim rate adjustments became effective as of November 1, 2020, subject to refund, based on Virginia Natural Gas' original request for an increase of approximately $50 million. Refunds to customers related to the difference between the approved rates and the interim rates were completed during the fourth quarter 2021.On November 18, 2021, the Illinois Commission approved a $240 million annual base rate increase for Nicor Gas effective November 24, 2021. The base rate increase included $94 million related to the recovery of program costs under the Investing in Illinois program and was based on a ROE of 9.75% and an equity ratio of 54.5%.See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Southern Company Gas"" for additional information.On July 1, 2021, Southern Company Gas affiliates completed the sale of Sequent to Williams Field Services Group for a total cash purchase price of $159 million, including final working capital adjustments. The pre-tax gain associated with the transaction was approximately $121 million ($92 million after tax). As a result of the sale, changes in state apportionment rates resulted in $85 million of additional tax expense. See Note 15 to the financial statements under ""Southern Company Gas"" for additional information.During the second and third quarters of 2021, Southern Company Gas recorded pre-tax impairment charges totaling $84 million ($67 million after tax) related to its equity method investment in the PennEast Pipeline project. On September 27, 2021, PennEast Pipeline announced that further development of the project is no longer supported, and, as a result, all further development of the project has ceased. See Note 7 to the financial statements under ""Southern Company Gas"" for additional information.Key Performance IndicatorsIn striving to achieve attractive risk-adjusted returns while providing cost-effective energy to approximately 8.7 million electric and gas utility customers collectively, the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Company Gas continue to focus on several key performance indicators. These indicators include, but are not limited to, customer satisfaction, plant availability, electric and natural gas system reliability, and execution of major construction projects. In addition, Southern Company and the Subsidiary Registrants focus on earnings per share (EPS) and net income, respectively, as a key performance indicator. See RESULTS OF OPERATIONS herein for information on the Registrants' financial performance. See RESULTS OF OPERATIONS – ""Southern Company Gas – Operating Metrics"" for additional information on Southern Company Gas' operating metrics, including Heating Degree Days, customer count, and volumes of natural gas sold.The financial success of the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Company Gas is directly tied to customer satisfaction. Key elements of ensuring customer satisfaction include outstanding service, high reliability, and competitive prices. The traditional electric operating companies use customer satisfaction surveys to evaluate their results and generally target the top quartile of these surveys in measuring performance. Reliability indicators are also used to evaluate results. See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Alabama Power – Rate RSE"" and ""Mississippi Power – Performance Evaluation Plan"" for additional information on Alabama Power's Rate RSE and Mississippi Power's PEP rate plan, respectively, both of which contain mechanisms that directly tie customer service indicators to the allowed equity return.Southern Power continues to focus on several key performance indicators, including, but not limited to, the equivalent forced outage rate and contract availability to evaluate operating results and help ensure its ability to meet its contractual commitments to customers.II-7 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual ReportRESULTS OF OPERATIONSSouthern CompanyConsolidated net income attributable to Southern Company was $2.4 billion in 2021, a decrease of $726 million, or 23.3%, from 2020. The decrease was primarily due to a $1.0 billion increase in after-tax charges related to the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 and higher non-fuel operations and maintenance costs, partially offset by an increase in natural gas revenues associated with colder weather in the first quarter 2021 as compared to the corresponding period in 2020 and infrastructure replacement programs and base rate changes, higher retail electric revenues primarily associated with rates and pricing and sales growth, a decrease in impairment charges and a gain on termination related to leveraged leases at Southern Holdings, and higher wholesale electric capacity revenues. See Notes 2, 9, and 15 to the financial statements under ""Georgia Power – Nuclear Construction,"" ""Southern Company Leveraged Lease,"" and ""Southern Company,"" respectively, for additional information.Basic EPS was $2.26 in 2021 and $2.95 in 2020. Diluted EPS, which factors in additional shares related to stock-based compensation, was $2.24 in 2021 and $2.93 in 2020. EPS for 2021 and 2020 was negatively impacted by $0.01 and $0.03 per share, respectively, as a result of increases in the average shares outstanding. See Note 8 to the financial statements under ""Outstanding Classes of Capital Stock – Southern Company"" for additional information.Dividends paid per share of common stock were $2.62 in 2021 and $2.54 in 2020. In January 2022, Southern Company declared a quarterly dividend of 66 cents per share. For 2021, the dividend payout ratio was 116% compared to 86% for 2020.Discussion of Southern Company's results of operations is divided into three parts – the Southern Company system's primary business of electricity sales, its gas business, and its other business activities.20212020(in millions)Electricity business$2,247 $3,115 Gas business539 590 Other business activities(393)(586)Net Income$2,393 $3,119 II-8 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual ReportElectricity BusinessSouthern Company's electric utilities generate and sell electricity to retail and wholesale customers.

The significant factors driving this change are shown in the preceding table. The increase in rates and pricing in 2021 was primarily due to an increase effective January 1, 2021 in Alabama Power's Rate RSE, net of a related customer refund, and increases at Georgia Power resulting from higher contributions by commercial and industrial customers with variable demand-driven pricing, fixed residential customer bill programs, the effects of higher KWH sales on ECCR tariff revenues, and base tariff increases in accordance with the 2019 ARP, partially offset by a decrease in Georgia Power's NCCR tariff, both effective January 1, 2021.Electric rates for the traditional electric operating companies include provisions to adjust billings for fluctuations in fuel costs, including the energy component of purchased power costs. Under these provisions, fuel revenues generally equal fuel expenses, including the energy component of PPA costs, and do not affect net income. The traditional electric operating companies each have one or more regulatory mechanisms to recover other costs such as environmental and other compliance costs, storm damage, new plants, and PPA capacity costs.See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Alabama Power"" and ""Georgia Power"" for additional information. Also see ""Energy Sales"" herein for a discussion of changes in the volume of energy sold, including changes related to sales growth (decline) and weather.Wholesale electric revenues consist of revenues from PPAs and short-term opportunity sales. Wholesale electric revenues from PPAs (other than solar and wind PPAs) have both capacity and energy components. Capacity revenues generally represent the greatest contribution to net income and are designed to provide recovery of fixed costs plus a return on investment. Energy revenues will vary depending on fuel prices, the market prices of wholesale energy compared to the Southern Company system's generation, demand for energy within the Southern Company system's electric service territory, and the availability of the Southern Company system's generation. Increases and decreases in energy revenues that are driven by fuel prices are accompanied by an increase or decrease in fuel costs and do not have a significant impact on net income. Energy sales from solar and wind PPAs do not have a capacity charge and customers either purchase the energy output of a dedicated renewable facility through an energy charge or through a fixed price related to the energy. As a result, the ability to recover fixed and variable operations and maintenance expenses is dependent upon the level of energy generated from these facilities, which can be impacted by weather conditions, equipment performance, transmission constraints, and other factors. Wholesale electric revenues at Mississippi Power include FERC-regulated MRA sales under cost-based tariffs as well as market-based sales. Short-term opportunity sales are made at market-based rates that generally provide a margin above the Southern Company system's variable cost to produce the energy.Wholesale electric revenues from power sales were as follows:20212020 (in millions)Capacity and other$550 $476 Energy1,905 1,469Total$2,455 $1,945 In 2021, wholesale electric revenues increased $510 million, or 26.2%, as compared to 2020 due to increases of $436 million in energy revenues and $74 million in capacity revenues. Energy revenues increased $292 million at Southern Power primarily from a $247 million net increase in the price of energy and a $45 million increase in the volume of KWHs sold. Energy revenues increased $144 million at the traditional electric operating companies primarily due to higher energy prices. The increase in capacity revenues primarily resulted from a power sales agreement at Alabama Power that began in September 2020 and a net increase in natural gas PPAs at Southern Power.Other Electric RevenuesOther electric revenues increased $46 million, or 6.8%, in 2021 as compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to increases of $28 million in transmission revenues primarily related to new PPAs at Southern Power and increased open access transmission tariff sales at Alabama Power, $27 million in customer fees largely resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic-related temporary suspensions of disconnections and late fees in 2020 for the traditional electric operating companies, $11 million from outdoor lighting sales at Georgia Power, and $10 million in cogeneration steam revenue associated with higher natural gas prices at Alabama Power, partially offset by a $26 million decrease in pole attachment revenues at Georgia Power.II-10 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual ReportEnergy SalesChanges in revenues are influenced heavily by the change in the volume of energy sold from year to year. KWH sales for 2021 and the percent change from 2020 were as follows:2021TotalKWHsTotal KWHPercent ChangeWeather-AdjustedPercent Change(*)(in billions)Residential47.4 (0.2)%0.5 %Commercial46.7 2.7 3.2 Industrial48.7 3.7 3.7 Other0.6 (5.1)(5.1)Total retail143.4 2.0 2.4 %Wholesale50.0 9.5 Total energy sales193.4 3.8 %(*)Weather-adjusted KWH sales are estimated using statistical models of the historical relationship between temperatures and energy sales, and then removing the estimated effect of deviations from normal temperature conditions. Normal temperature conditions are defined as those experienced in the applicable service territory over a specified historical period. This metric is useful because it allows trends in historical operations to be evaluated apart from the influence of weather conditions. Management also considers this metric in developing long-term capital and financial plans.Changes in retail energy sales are generally the result of changes in electricity usage by customers, weather, and the number of customers. Weather-adjusted retail energy sales increased 3.4 billion KWHs in 2021 as compared to 2020. Weather-adjusted residential usage increased primarily due to customer growth, largely offset by decreased customer usage resulting from shelter-in-place orders in effect during 2020. Weather-adjusted commercial and industrial usage increased primarily due to the negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on energy sales being more severe in 2020.See ""Electric Operating Revenues"" above for a discussion of significant changes in wholesale revenues related to changes in price and KWH sales.Other RevenuesOther revenues increased $38 million, or 16.0%, in 2021 as compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to increases in unregulated sales of products and services of $29 million at Alabama Power and $9 million at Georgia Power.Fuel and Purchased Power ExpensesThe mix of fuel sources for the generation of electricity is determined primarily by demand, the unit cost of fuel consumed, and the availability of generating units. Additionally, the electric utilities purchase a portion of their electricity needs from the wholesale market.II-11 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual ReportDetails of the Southern Company system's generation and purchased power were as follows:20212020Total generation (in billions of KWHs)(a)179 174 Total purchased power (in billions of KWHs)18 18 Sources of generation (percent) —Gas48 52 Coal22 18 Nuclear18 18 Hydro4 4 Wind, Solar, and Other8 8 Cost of fuel, generated (in cents per net KWH) —Gas(a)3.07 2.03 Coal2.85 2.91 Nuclear0.75 0.78 Average cost of fuel, generated (in cents per net KWH)(a)2.55 1.96 Average cost of purchased power (in cents per net KWH)(b)5.85 4.65 (a)Excludes Central Alabama Generating Station KWHs and associated cost of fuel as its fuel is provided by the purchaser under a power sales agreement. See Note 15 to the financial statements under ""Alabama Power"" for additional information.(b)Average cost of purchased power includes fuel purchased by the Southern Company system for tolling agreements where power is generated by the provider.In 2021, total fuel and purchased power expenses were $5.0 billion, an increase of $1.2 billion, or 32.4%, as compared to 2020. The increase was primarily the result of a $1.1 billion increase in the average cost of fuel generated and purchased and a $170 million increase in the volume of KWHs generated and purchased.Fuel and purchased power energy transactions at the traditional electric operating companies are generally offset by fuel revenues and do not have a significant impact on net income. See Note 2 to the financial statements for additional information. Fuel expenses incurred under Southern Power's PPAs are generally the responsibility of the counterparties and do not significantly impact net income.FuelIn 2021, fuel expense was $4.0 billion, an increase of $1.0 billion, or 35.2%, as compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to a 51.2% increase in the average cost of natural gas per KWH generated, a 25.7% increase in the volume of KWHs generated by coal, and a 12.2% decrease in the volume of KWHs generated by hydro, partially offset by a 4.9% decrease in the volume of KWHs generated by natural gas.Purchased PowerIn 2021, purchased power expense was $978 million, an increase of $179 million, or 22.4%, as compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to a 25.8% increase in the average cost per KWH purchased primarily due to higher natural gas prices.Energy purchases will vary depending on demand for energy within the Southern Company system's electric service territory, the market prices of wholesale energy as compared to the cost of the Southern Company system's generation, and the availability of the Southern Company system's generation.Cost of Other SalesCost of other sales increased $15 million, or 16.0%, in 2021 as compared to 2020 primarily due to an increase in unregulated power delivery construction and maintenance projects at Georgia Power.Other Operations and Maintenance ExpensesOther operations and maintenance expenses increased $559 million, or 13.2%, in 2021 as compared to 2020. A portion of the increase in 2021 compared to 2020 reflects cost containment activities implemented to help offset the effects of the recessionary economy resulting from the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. The increase was primarily associated with increases of $174 million in transmission and distribution expenses, including $37 million of reliability NDR credits applied in 2020 at Alabama II-12 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual ReportPower, $133 million in scheduled generation outage and maintenance expenses, and $63 million in compensation and benefit expenses, as well as a $40 million loss on sales-type leases associated with PPAs at Southern Power's Garland and Tranquillity battery energy storage facilities. Also contributing to the increase was a $19 million increase in compliance and environmental expenses at the traditional electric operating companies and an $18 million decrease in nuclear property insurance refunds at Alabama Power and Georgia Power. See Notes 2 and 9 to the financial statements under ""Alabama Power – Rate NDR"" and ""Lessor,"" respectively, for additional information.Depreciation and AmortizationDepreciation and amortization increased $12 million, or 0.4%, in 2021 as compared to 2020. The increase was due to an increase of $111 million in depreciation associated with additional plant in service, partially offset by a net decrease of $90 million in amortization of regulatory assets primarily associated with CCR AROs under the terms of Georgia Power's 2019 ARP. See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Georgia Power – Rate Plans"" for additional information.Taxes Other Than Income TaxesTaxes other than income taxes increased $38 million, or 3.7%, in 2021 as compared to 2020. The increase primarily reflects a $25 million increase in municipal franchise fees at Georgia Power and a $21 million increase in property taxes primarily resulting from higher assessed values, partially offset by a $14 million decrease in utility license taxes at Alabama Power.Estimated Loss on Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4Estimated probable loss on Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 increased $1.4 billion in 2021 as compared to 2020. The losses in each year were recorded to reflect Georgia Power's revised total project capital cost forecast to complete construction and start-up of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Georgia Power – Nuclear Construction"" for additional information.Gain on Dispositions, NetGain on dispositions, net increased $17 million, or 40.5%, in 2021 as compared to 2020. The increase primarily reflects $41 million in gains at Southern Power primarily due to contributions of wind turbine equipment to various equity method investments in the first quarter 2021 and $14 million in gains at Alabama Power primarily from property sales, partially offset by a $39 million gain at Southern Power related to the sale of Plant Mankato in the first quarter 2020. See Notes 7 and 15 to the financial statements under ""Southern Power"" for additional information.Allowance for Equity Funds Used During ConstructionAllowance for equity funds used during construction increased $41 million, or 29.7%, in 2021 as compared to 2020. The increase was primarily associated with Georgia Power's construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Georgia Power – Nuclear Construction – Regulatory Matters"" for additional information.Interest Expense, Net of Amounts CapitalizedInterest expense, net of amounts capitalized decreased $8 million, or 0.8%, in 2021 as compared to 2020 primarily due to a decrease of approximately $30 million due to lower interest rates at the traditional electric operating companies and an $11 million net increase in capitalized interest, partially offset by an increase of approximately $33 million due to an increase in average outstanding long-term borrowings. See Note 8 to the financial statements for additional information.Other Income (Expense), NetOther income (expense), net increased $112 million, or 35.6%, in 2021 as compared to 2020 primarily related to a $135 million increase in non-service cost-related retirement benefits income, partially offset by a $12 million gain recorded by Southern Power in the third quarter 2020 associated with the Roserock solar facility litigation and an $8 million decrease in interest income. See Note 11 to the financial statements for additional information.Income TaxesIncome taxes decreased $298 million, or 57.6%, in 2021 as compared to 2020. The decrease was primarily due to lower pre-tax earnings primarily resulting from higher charges in 2021 associated with the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 at Georgia Power and changes in state apportionment methodology resulting from tax legislation enacted by the State of Alabama in February 2021 at Southern Power, partially offset by an increase in a valuation allowance on certain state tax credit carryforwards II-13 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual Reportat Georgia Power.

Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests increased $68 million in 2021 as compared to 2020. The increased loss was primarily due to loss allocations to Southern Power's partners in the Garland and Tranquillity battery energy storage facilities, including $26 million allocated from the loss on sales-type leases. In addition, the increased loss was due to higher HLBV loss allocations to Southern Power's wind tax equity partners, including new partnerships entered into during 2020 and 2021, and lower income allocations to Southern Power's solar equity partners, totaling $29 million. See Notes 9 and 15 to the financial statements under ""Lessor"" and ""Southern Power,"" respectively, for additional information.Gas BusinessSouthern Company Gas distributes natural gas through utilities in four states and is involved in several other complementary businesses including gas pipeline investments, wholesale gas services (until the sale of Sequent on July 1, 2021), and gas marketing services.A condensed statement of income for the gas business follows: 2021Increase (Decrease) from 2020 (in millions)Operating revenues$4,380 $946 Cost of natural gas1,619 647 Other operations and maintenance1,072 106 Depreciation and amortization536 36 Taxes other than income taxes225 19 Gain on dispositions, net(127)(105)Total operating expenses3,325 703 Operating income1,055 243 Earnings from equity method investments50 (91)Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized238 7 Other income (expense), net(53)(94)Income taxes275 102 Net income$539 $(51)Seasonality of ResultsDuring the period from November through March when natural gas usage and operating revenues are generally higher (Heating Season), more customers are connected to Southern Company Gas' distribution systems and natural gas usage is higher in periods of colder weather. Prior to the sale of Sequent, wholesale gas services' operating revenues were occasionally impacted due to peak usage by power generators in response to summer energy demands. Southern Company Gas' base operating expenses, excluding cost of natural gas, bad debt expense, and certain incentive compensation costs, are incurred relatively equally over any given year. Thus, operating results can vary significantly from quarter to quarter as a result of seasonality. For 2021, the percentage of operating revenues and net income generated during the Heating Season (January through March and November through December) were 70% and 102%, respectively. For 2020, the percentage of operating revenues and net income generated during the Heating Season were 68% and 86%, respectively.II-14 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual ReportOperating RevenuesOperating revenues in 2021 were $4.4 billion, reflecting a $946 million, or 27.5%, increase compared to 2020. Details of operating revenues were as follows:2021(in millions)Operating revenues – prior year$3,434 Estimated change resulting from –Infrastructure replacement programs and base rate changes146 Gas costs and other cost recovery675 Wholesale gas services114 Other11 Operating revenues – current year$4,380 Revenues at the natural gas distribution utilities increased in 2021 compared to 2020 due to rate increases and continued investment in infrastructure replacement. See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Southern Company Gas"" for additional information.Revenues associated with gas costs and other cost recovery increased in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to higher natural gas cost recovery as a result of higher volumes of natural gas sold and an increase in natural gas prices. The natural gas distribution utilities have weather or revenue normalization mechanisms that mitigate revenue fluctuations from customer consumption changes. Natural gas distribution rates include provisions to adjust billings for fluctuations in natural gas costs. Therefore, gas costs recovered through natural gas revenues generally equal the amount expensed in cost of natural gas and do not affect net income from the natural gas distribution utilities. See ""Cost of Natural Gas"" herein for additional information.Revenues from wholesale gas services increased in 2021 primarily due to higher volumes of natural gas sold and higher commercial activities as a result of Winter Storm Uri, partially offset by derivative losses, all prior to the sale of Sequent. See Note 15 to the financial statements under ""Southern Company Gas"" for additional information.Southern Company Gas hedged its exposure to warmer-than-normal weather in Illinois for gas distribution operations and in Illinois and Georgia for gas marketing services. The remaining impacts of weather on earnings were immaterial.Cost of Natural GasExcluding Atlanta Gas Light, which does not sell natural gas to end-use customers, the natural gas distribution utilities charge their utility customers for natural gas consumed using natural gas cost recovery mechanisms set by the applicable state regulatory agencies. Under these mechanisms, all prudently-incurred natural gas costs are passed through to customers without markup, subject to regulatory review. The natural gas distribution utilities defer or accrue the difference between the actual cost of natural gas and the amount of commodity revenue earned in a given period. The deferred or accrued amount is either billed or refunded to customers prospectively through adjustments to the commodity rate. Deferred natural gas costs are reflected as regulatory assets and accrued natural gas costs are reflected as regulatory liabilities. Therefore, gas costs recovered through natural gas revenues generally equal the amount expensed in cost of natural gas and do not affect net income from the natural gas distribution utilities. Cost of natural gas at the natural gas distribution utilities represented 86.3% of the total cost of natural gas for 2021.Gas marketing services customers are charged for actual and estimated natural gas consumed. Cost of natural gas includes the cost of fuel and associated transportation costs, lost and unaccounted for gas, adjustments to reduce the value of inventories to market value, if applicable, and gains and losses associated with certain derivatives.Cost of natural gas was $1.6 billion, an increase of $647 million, or 66.6%, in 2021 compared to 2020, which reflects higher gas cost recovery in 2021 as a result of higher volumes sold and a 91.2% increase in natural gas prices compared to 2020.Other Operations and Maintenance ExpensesOther operations and maintenance expenses increased $106 million, or 11.0%, in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to increases of $60 million in compensation expenses, $30 million of which was at Sequent, $10 million in facility costs, and $10 million in bad debt expense, which is passed through directly to customers and has no impact on net income.II-15 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual ReportDepreciation and AmortizationDepreciation and amortization increased $36 million, or 7.2%, in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to continued infrastructure investments at the natural gas distribution utilities. See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Southern Company Gas – Infrastructure Replacement Programs and Capital Projects"" for additional information.Taxes Other Than Income TaxesTaxes other than income taxes increased $19 million, or 9.2%, in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to a $15 million increase in revenue tax expenses as a result of higher natural gas revenues at Nicor Gas, which are passed through directly to customers and have no impact on net income.Gain on Dispositions, NetGain on dispositions, net increased $105 million in 2021 compared to 2020. In 2021, Southern Company Gas recorded a $121 million gain on the sale of Sequent, as well as an additional $5 million gain from the sale of Pivotal LNG. In 2020, Southern Company Gas recorded a $22 million gain on the sale of Jefferson Island. See Note 15 to the financial statements under ""Southern Company Gas"" for additional information.Earnings from Equity Method InvestmentsEarnings from equity method investments decreased $91 million, or 64.5%, in 2021 compared to 2020. The decrease was primarily due to impairment charges in 2021 totaling $84 million related to the PennEast Pipeline project. See Note 7 to the financial statements under ""Southern Company Gas"" for additional information.Other Income (Expense), NetOther income (expense), net decreased $94 million in 2021 compared to 2020. The decrease was largely due to $101 million in charitable contributions by Sequent prior to its sale.Income TaxesIncome taxes increased $102 million, or 59.0%, in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to $114 million in additional tax expense resulting from the sale of Sequent, including changes in state tax apportionment rates, and higher pre-tax earnings at the natural gas distribution utilities, partially offset by $18 million of tax benefit resulting from the PennEast Pipeline project impairment charges in the second and third quarters of 2021. See Notes 7 and 15 to the financial statements under ""Southern Company Gas"" and Note 10 to the financial statements for additional information.Other Business ActivitiesSouthern Company's other business activities primarily include the parent company (which does not allocate operating expenses to business units); PowerSecure, which provides distributed energy and resilience solutions and deploys microgrids for commercial, industrial, governmental, and utility customers; Southern Holdings, which invests in various projects; and Southern Linc, which provides digital wireless communications for use by the Southern Company system and also markets these services to the public and provides fiber optics services within the Southeast.II-16 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual ReportA condensed statement of operations for Southern Company's other business activities follows:2021Increase (Decrease) from 2020(in millions)Operating revenues$433 $(11)Cost of other sales249 15 Other operations and maintenance207 11 Depreciation and amortization75 (2)Taxes other than income taxes4 — Gain on dispositions, net— 1 Total operating expenses535 25 Operating income (loss)(102)(36)Earnings from equity method investments26 14 Interest expense631 17 Impairment of leveraged leases7 (199)Other income (expense), net94 103 Income taxes (benefit)(227)70 Net loss$(393)$193 Operating RevenuesSouthern Company's operating revenues for these other business activities decreased $11 million, or 2.5%, in 2021 as compared to 2020 primarily due to a decrease at Southern Linc related to a contract for the design and construction of a fiber optic system completed in 2020.Cost of Other SalesCost of other sales for these other business activities increased $15 million, or 6.4%, in 2021 as compared to 2020 primarily due to distributed infrastructure projects at PowerSecure.Other Operations and Maintenance ExpensesOther operations and maintenance expenses for these other business activities increased $11 million, or 5.6%, in 2021 as compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to a $16 million increase at the parent company primarily related to director compensation expenses and an $11 million increase at PowerSecure primarily associated with higher bad debt expense, partially offset by a $17 million decrease at Southern Linc primarily related to the design and construction of a fiber optic system completed in 2020.Earnings from Equity Method InvestmentsEarnings from equity method investments for these other business activities increased $14 million in 2021 as compared to 2020 primarily due to an increase in investment income at Southern Holdings.Interest ExpenseInterest expense for these other business activities increased $17 million, or 2.8%, in 2021 as compared to 2020 primarily due to an increase of approximately $64 million related to higher average outstanding long-term borrowings, partially offset by decreases of approximately $34 million due to lower interest rates and $6 million due to a reduction in losses associated with the extinguishment of debt at the parent company. See Note 8 to the financial statements for additional information.Impairment of Leveraged LeasesImpairment charges related to leveraged lease investments at Southern Holdings decreased $199 million, or 96.6%, in 2021 as compared to 2020.

See Note 15 to the financial statements under ""Southern Company"" for additional information.Income Taxes (Benefit)The income tax benefit for these other business activities decreased $70 million, or 23.6%, in 2021 as compared to 2020 primarily due to the tax impacts related to the 2020 charges associated with leveraged lease investments and the 2021 leveraged lease dispositions at Southern Holdings, partially offset by lower pre-tax earnings at the parent company. See Notes 9, 10, and 15 to the financial statements under ""Southern Company Leveraged Lease,"" ""Effective Tax Rate,"" and ""Southern Company,"" respectively, for additional information.Alabama PowerAlabama Power's 2021 net income after dividends on preferred stock was $1.24 billion, representing an $88 million, or 7.7%, increase from 2020. The increase was primarily due to an increase in retail revenues associated with an adjustment effective in January 2021 to Rate RSE, net of a related customer refund, and higher customer usage. Also contributing to the increase were additional wholesale capacity revenues related to a power sales agreement that began in September 2020 and increased sales of unregulated products and services. These increases to income were partially offset by increases in operations and maintenance expenses and depreciation. See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Alabama Power – Rate RSE"" for additional information.A condensed income statement for Alabama Power follows:2021Increase(Decrease)from 2020(in millions)Operating revenues$6,413 $583 Fuel1,235 265 Purchased power368 49 Other operations and maintenance1,735 116 Depreciation and amortization859 47 Taxes other than income taxes410 (6)Total operating expenses4,607 471 Operating income1,806 112 Allowance for equity funds used during construction52 6 Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized340 2 Other income (expense), net107 7 Income taxes372 35 Net income1,253 88 Dividends on preferred stock15 — Net income after dividends on preferred stock$1,238 $88 II-18 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual ReportOperating RevenuesOperating revenues for 2021 were $6.4 billion, reflecting a $583 million, or 10.0%, increase from 2020.

The significant factors driving this change are shown in the preceding table. The increase was primarily due to a Rate RSE increase effective January 1, 2021, increases in fuel and other cost recovery, and increases in commercial and industrial sales primarily due to the negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on energy demand being more severe in 2020. These increases were offset by an increase in the accrual for a Rate RSE customer refund and milder weather in 2021 when compared to 2020. See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Alabama Power – Rate RSE"" for additional information.See ""Energy Sales"" herein for a discussion of changes in the volume of energy sold, including changes related to sales growth and weather.Electric rates include provisions to recognize the recovery of fuel costs, purchased power costs, PPAs certificated by the Alabama PSC, and costs associated with the NDR. Under these provisions, fuel and other cost recovery revenues generally equal fuel and other cost recovery expenses and do not affect net income. See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Alabama Power"" for additional information.Wholesale revenues from sales to non-affiliated utilities were as follows:20212020(in millions)Capacity and other$173 $127 Energy204 142 Total non-affiliated$377 $269 In 2021, wholesale revenues from sales to non-affiliates increased $108 million, or 40.1%, as compared to 2020 due to a $46 million increase in capacity revenues primarily related to a power sales agreement that began in September 2020 and a $62 million increase in energy revenues primarily due to higher natural gas prices. See Notes 2 and 15 to the financial statements under ""Alabama Power – Certificates of Convenience and Necessity"" and ""Alabama Power,"" respectively, for additional information.Wholesale revenues from sales to non-affiliates will vary depending on fuel prices, the market prices of wholesale energy compared to the cost of Alabama Power's and the Southern Company system's generation, demand for energy within the Southern Company system's electric service territory, and availability of the Southern Company system's generation. Increases and decreases in energy revenues that are driven by fuel prices are accompanied by an increase or decrease in fuel costs and do not affect net income. Short-term opportunity energy sales are also included in wholesale energy sales to non-affiliates. These II-19 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual Reportopportunity sales are made at market-based rates that generally provide a margin above Alabama Power's variable cost to produce the energy.In 2021, wholesale revenues from sales to affiliates increased $125 million, or 271.7%, as compared to 2020. The revenue increase reflects a 110.0% increase in 2021 KWH sales due to higher demand for Alabama Power's available lower cost generation and a 75.8% increase in the price of energy, primarily natural gas.Wholesale revenues from sales to affiliated companies will vary depending on demand and the availability and cost of generating resources at each company. These affiliate sales and purchases are made in accordance with the IIC, as approved by the FERC. These transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings since this energy is generally sold at marginal cost and energy purchases are generally offset by energy revenues through Alabama Power's energy cost recovery clause.In 2021, other operating revenues increased $64 million, or 21.2%, as compared to 2020 primarily due to a $29 million increase in unregulated sales of products and services, a $13 million increase in customer fees largely resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic-related temporary suspensions of disconnections and late fees in 2020, a $10 million increase in cogeneration steam revenue associated with higher natural gas prices, and an $8 million increase in transmission revenues primarily related to open access transmission tariff sales.Energy SalesChanges in revenues are influenced heavily by the change in the volume of energy sold from year to year. KWH sales for 2021 and the percent change from 2020 were as follows:2021TotalKWHsTotal KWHPercent ChangeWeather-AdjustedPercent Change(*)(in billions)Residential17.5 (0.9)%(0.7)%Commercial12.7 2.3 2.9 Industrial20.8 2.2 2.2 Other0.1 (13.8)(13.8)Total retail51.1 1.1 1.3 %Wholesale Non-affiliates9.8 53.8 Affiliates5.2 110.0 Total wholesale15.0 69.6 Total energy sales66.1 11.3 %(*)Weather-adjusted KWH sales are estimated using statistical models of the historical relationship between temperatures and energy sales, and then removing the estimated effect of deviations from the normal temperature conditions. Normal temperature conditions are defined as those experienced in Alabama Power's service territory over a specified historical period. This metric is useful because it allows trends in historical operations to be evaluated apart from the influence of weather conditions. Management also considers this metric in developing long-term capital and financial plans.Changes in retail energy sales are generally the result of changes in electricity usage by customers, weather, and the number of customers. Revenues attributable to changes in sales increased in 2021 when compared to 2020. In 2021, weather-adjusted residential KWH sales decreased 0.7% primarily due to safer-at-home guidelines in effect during 2020. Weather-adjusted commercial KWH sales increased 2.9% and industrial KWH sales increased 2.2% primarily due to the negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on energy sales being more severe in 2020.See ""Operating Revenues"" above for a discussion of significant changes in wholesale revenues from sales to non-affiliates and wholesale revenues from sales to affiliated companies related to changes in price and KWH sales.Fuel and Purchased Power ExpensesThe mix of fuel sources for generation of electricity is determined primarily by the unit cost of fuel consumed, demand, and the availability of generating units. Additionally, Alabama Power purchases a portion of its electricity needs from the wholesale market.II-20 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual ReportDetails of Alabama Power's generation and purchased power were as follows:20212020Total generation (in billions of KWHs)(a)58.553.8 Total purchased power (in billions of KWHs)6.46.9 Sources of generation (percent)(a) —Coal46 40 Nuclear26 28 Gas19 22 Hydro9 10 Cost of fuel, generated (in cents per net KWH) —Coal2.77 2.74 Nuclear0.70 0.75 Gas(a)2.89 2.13 Average cost of fuel, generated (in cents per net KWH)(a)2.22 1.98 Average cost of purchased power (in cents per net KWH)(b)6.52 4.82 (a)Excludes Central Alabama Generating Station KWHs and associated cost of fuel as its fuel is provided by the purchaser under a power sales agreement. See Note 15 to the financial statements under ""Alabama Power"" for additional information.(b)Average cost of purchased power includes fuel, energy, and transmission purchased by Alabama Power for tolling agreements where power is generated by the provider.Fuel and purchased power expenses were $1.6 billion in 2021, an increase of $314 million, or 24.4%, compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to a $196 million increase in the average cost of fuel and purchased power and a $117 million net increase related to the volume of KWHs generated and purchased.Fuel and purchased power energy transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings, since energy expenses are generally offset by energy revenues through Alabama Power's energy cost recovery clause. Alabama Power, along with the Alabama PSC, continuously monitors the under/over recovered balance to determine whether adjustments to billing rates are required. See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Alabama Power – Rate ECR"" for additional information.FuelFuel expense was $1.2 billion in 2021, an increase of $265 million, or 27.3%, compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to a 35.7% increase in the average cost of natural gas per KWH generated, which excludes tolling agreements, a 25.1% increase in the volume of KWHs generated by coal, and an 8.8% decrease in the volume of KWHs generated by hydro, partially offset by a 6.7% decrease in the average cost of nuclear fuel per KWH generated and a 3.6% decrease in the volume of KWHs generated by natural gas.Purchased Power – Non-AffiliatesPurchased power expense from non-affiliates was $221 million in 2021, an increase of $30 million, or 15.7%, compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to a 19.4% increase in the amount of energy purchased due to a new PPA that began in September 2020 and a 10.6% increase in the average cost of purchased power per KWH as a result of higher natural gas prices.Energy purchases from non-affiliates will vary depending on the market prices of wholesale energy as compared to the cost of the Southern Company system's generation, demand for energy within the Southern Company system's service territory, and the availability of the Southern Company system's generation.Purchased Power – AffiliatesPurchased power expense from affiliates was $147 million in 2021, an increase of $19 million, or 14.8%, compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to an 87.4% increase in the average cost of purchased power per KWH as a result of higher natural gas prices, partially offset by a 38.8% decrease in the volume of KWH purchased as Alabama Power's units generally dispatched at a lower cost than other available Southern Company system resources.II-21 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual ReportEnergy purchases from affiliates will vary depending on demand for energy and the availability and cost of generating resources at each company within the Southern Company system. These purchases are made in accordance with the IIC or other contractual agreements, as approved by the FERC.Other Operations and Maintenance ExpensesOther operations and maintenance expenses increased $116 million, or 7.2%, in 2021 as compared to 2020. A portion of the increase in 2021 compared to 2020 reflects cost containment activities implemented to help offset the effects of the recessionary economy resulting from the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. The increase was primarily due to a $59 million increase in generation expenses associated with scheduled outages and Rate CNP Compliance-related expenses primarily related to the addition of new environmental systems in 2021. Also contributing to the increase were increases of $55 million in transmission and distribution line maintenance expenses related to reliability NDR credits applied in 2020 and vegetation management expenses, $22 million in compensation and benefit expenses, and $11 million related to unregulated products and services, as well as a $10 million decrease in nuclear property insurance refunds. The increase was partially offset by a $36 million decrease in bad debt expense and a net decrease of $35 million to the NDR accrual in 2021 when compared to 2020. See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Alabama Power – Rate NDR"" and "" – Rate CNP Compliance"" for additional information.Depreciation and AmortizationDepreciation and amortization increased $47 million, or 5.8%, in 2021 as compared to 2020 primarily due to additional plant in service, including the purchase of the Central Alabama Generating Station in August 2020. See Notes 5 and 15 to the financial statements for additional information.Interest Expense, Net of Amounts CapitalizedInterest expense, net of amounts capitalized increased $2 million, or 0.6%, in 2021 as compared to 2020 primarily due to an increase of approximately $17 million associated with higher average outstanding borrowings, largely offset by a decrease of approximately $16 million related to lower interest rates. See Note 8 to the financial statements for additional information.Other Income (Expense), NetOther income (expense), net increased $7 million, or 7.0%, in 2021 as compared to 2020 primarily due to an increase in non-service cost-related retirement benefits income. See Note 11 to the financial statements for additional information.Income Taxes Income taxes increased $35 million, or 10.4%, in 2021 as compared to 2020 primarily due to higher pre-tax earnings. See Note 10 to the financial statements for additional information.Georgia PowerGeorgia Power's 2021 net income was $584 million, representing a $991 million, or 62.9%, decrease from the previous year. The decrease was primarily due to a $1.0 billion increase in after-tax charges related to the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Also contributing to the decrease were higher non-fuel operations and maintenance costs, partially offset by higher retail revenues associated with sales growth. See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Georgia Power – Nuclear Construction"" for additional information on the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4.II-22 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual ReportA condensed income statement for Georgia Power follows:2021Increase(Decrease)from 2020(in millions)Operating revenues$9,260 $951 Fuel1,449 308 Purchased power1,491 442 Other operations and maintenance2,213 260 Depreciation and amortization1,371 (54)Taxes other than income taxes476 32 Estimated loss on Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 41,692 1,367 Total operating expenses8,692 2,355 Operating income568 (1,404)Allowance for equity funds used during construction127 36 Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized421 (4)Other income (expense), net142 53 Income taxes (benefit)(168)(320)Net income$584 $(991)Operating RevenuesOperating revenues for 2021 were $9.3 billion, reflecting a $951 million, or 11.4%, increase from 2020.

The significant factors driving this change are shown in the preceding table. The increase in rates and pricing was primarily due to higher contributions from commercial and industrial customers with variable demand-driven pricing, fixed residential customer bill programs, the effects of higher KWH sales on ECCR tariff revenues, and base tariff increases in accordance with the 2019 ARP, partially offset by a decrease in the NCCR tariff, both effective January 1, 2021. See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Georgia Power – Rate Plans"" for additional information.See ""Energy Sales"" below for a discussion of changes in the volume of energy sold, including changes related to the sales growth in 2021.Electric rates include provisions to adjust billings for fluctuations in fuel costs, including the energy component of purchased power costs. Under these fuel cost recovery provisions, fuel revenues generally equal fuel expenses and do not affect net income.

Wholesale revenues from sales to non-affiliates will vary depending on fuel prices, the market prices of wholesale energy compared to the cost of Georgia Power's and the Southern Company system's generation, demand for energy within the Southern Company system's electric service territory, and the availability of the Southern Company system's generation. Increases and decreases in energy revenues that are driven by fuel prices are accompanied by an increase or decrease in fuel costs and do not have a significant impact on net income. Short-term opportunity sales are made at market-based rates that generally provide a margin above Georgia Power's variable cost of energy.Wholesale revenues from sales to affiliated companies will vary depending on demand and the availability and cost of generating resources at each company. These affiliate sales are made in accordance with the IIC, as approved by the FERC. These transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings since this energy is generally sold at marginal cost.Other operating revenues were flat in 2021 compared to 2020. Increases of $33 million in unregulated sales associated with power delivery construction and maintenance projects and outdoor lighting and $13 million in customer fees, largely resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic-related temporary suspension of disconnections and late fees in 2020, were largely offset by decreases of $26 million in pole attachment revenues, $9 million associated with the timing of certain unregulated energy conservation projects, and $5 million from retail solar programs.Energy SalesChanges in revenues are influenced heavily by the change in the volume of energy sold from year to year. KWH sales for 2021 and the percent change from 2020 were as follows:2021TotalKWHsTotal KWHPercent ChangeWeather-AdjustedPercent Change(*)(in billions)Residential27.8 0.1 %1.3 %Commercial31.3 2.9 3.4 Industrial23.3 5.6 5.7 Other0.5 (2.3)(2.4)Total retail82.9 2.6 3.3 %Wholesale3.2 18.1 Total energy sales86.1 3.1 %(*)Weather-adjusted KWH sales are estimated using statistical models of the historical relationship between temperatures and energy sales, and then removing the estimated effect of deviations from normal temperature conditions. Normal temperature conditions are defined as those experienced in Georgia Power's service territory over a specified historical period. This metric is useful because it allows trends in historical operations to be evaluated apart from the influence of weather conditions. Management also considers this metric in developing long-term capital and financial plans.Changes in retail energy sales are generally the result of changes in electricity usage by customers, weather, and the number of customers. Revenues attributable to changes in sales increased in 2021 when compared to 2020. In 2021, weather-adjusted residential KWH sales increased 1.3% compared to 2020 primarily due to customer growth, partially offset by decreased customer usage largely due to shelter-in-place orders in effect during 2020. Weather-adjusted commercial KWH sales increased 3.4% and II-24 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual Reportweather-adjusted industrial KWH sales increased 5.7% primarily due to the negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on energy sales being more severe in 2020.See ""Operating Revenues"" above for a discussion of significant changes in wholesale sales to non-affiliates and affiliated companies.Fuel and Purchased Power ExpensesFuel costs constitute one of the largest expenses for Georgia Power. The mix of fuel sources for the generation of electricity is determined primarily by demand, the unit cost of fuel consumed, and the availability of generating units. Additionally, Georgia Power purchases a portion of its electricity needs from the wholesale market.Details of Georgia Power's generation and purchased power were as follows:20212020Total generation (in billions of KWHs)58.156.8 Total purchased power (in billions of KWHs)31.730.5 Sources of generation (percent) —Gas48 52 Nuclear28 27 Coal20 16 Hydro and other4 5 Cost of fuel, generated (in cents per net KWH) —Gas3.05 2.19 Nuclear0.79 0.80 Coal2.99 3.23 Average cost of fuel, generated (in cents per net KWH)2.39 1.96 Average cost of purchased power (in cents per net KWH)(*)5.07 3.69 (*) Average cost of purchased power includes fuel purchased by Georgia Power for tolling agreements where power is generated by the provider.Fuel and purchased power expenses were $2.9 billion in 2021, an increase of $750 million, or 34.2%, compared to 2020. The increase was due to an increase of $651 million related to the average cost of fuel and purchased power and an increase of $99 million related to the volume of KWHs generated and purchased.Fuel and purchased power energy transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings since these fuel expenses are generally offset by fuel revenues through Georgia Power's fuel cost recovery mechanism. See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Georgia Power – Fuel Cost Recovery"" for additional information.FuelFuel expense was $1.4 billion in 2021, an increase of $308 million, or 27.0%, compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to a 39.3% increase in the average cost of natural gas per KWH generated and a 27.8% increase in the volume of KWHs generated by coal, partially offset by a 7.4% decrease in the average cost of coal per KWH generated and a decrease of 5.2% in the volume of KWHs generated by natural gas.Purchased Power - Non-AffiliatesPurchased power expense from non-affiliates was $632 million in 2021, an increase of $92 million, or 17.0%, compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to an increase of 23.4% in the average cost per KWH purchased primarily due to higher natural gas prices, partially offset by a decrease of 3.5% in the volume of KWHs purchased as Georgia Power units and Southern Company system resources generally dispatched at a lower cost than available market resources.Energy purchases from non-affiliates will vary depending on the market prices of wholesale energy as compared to the cost of the Southern Company system's generation, demand for energy within the Southern Company system's electric service territory, and the availability of the Southern Company system's generation.II-25 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual ReportPurchased Power - AffiliatesPurchased power expense from affiliates was $859 million in 2021, an increase of $350 million, or 68.8%, compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to an increase of 53.4% in the average cost per KWH purchased primarily due to higher natural gas prices and an increase of 8.4% in the volume of KWHs purchased due to lower cost Southern Company system resources as compared to available Georgia Power-owned generation and market resources.Energy purchases from affiliates will vary depending on the demand and the availability and cost of generating resources at each company within the Southern Company system. These purchases are made in accordance with the IIC or other contractual agreements, all as approved by the FERC.Other Operations and Maintenance ExpensesOther operations and maintenance expenses increased $260 million, or 13.3%, in 2021 as compared to 2020. A portion of the increase in 2021 compared to 2020 reflects cost containment activities implemented to help offset the effects of the recessionary economy resulting from the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. The increase was primarily due to increases of $104 million in transmission and distribution expenses associated with vegetation and asset management activities, $63 million in generation expenses associated with outage and non-outage maintenance costs and environmental projects, $28 million in certain compensation and benefit expenses, and $8 million in maintenance costs at corporate and field support facilities, as well as an $8 million decrease in nuclear property insurance refunds.Depreciation and AmortizationDepreciation and amortization decreased $54 million, or 3.8%, in 2021 as compared to 2020 primarily due to an $88 million decrease in amortization of regulatory assets related to CCR AROs under the terms of the 2019 ARP, partially offset by a $39 million increase in depreciation associated with additional plant in service. See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Georgia Power – Rate Plans – 2019 ARP"" for additional information.Taxes Other Than Income TaxesTaxes other than income taxes increased $32 million, or 7.2%, in 2021 as compared to 2020 primarily due to a $25 million increase in municipal franchise fees largely related to higher retail revenues and a $9 million increase in property taxes primarily resulting from an increase in the assessed value of property.Estimated Loss on Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4Estimated probable loss on Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 increased $1.4 billion in 2021 as compared to 2020. The losses in each year were recorded to reflect revisions to the total project capital cost forecast to complete construction and start-up of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Georgia Power – Nuclear Construction"" for additional information.Allowance for Equity Funds Used During ConstructionAllowance for equity funds used during construction increased $36 million, or 39.6%, in 2021 as compared to 2020 primarily due to a higher AFUDC base largely associated with the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Georgia Power – Nuclear Construction"" for additional information regarding Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4.Interest Expense, Net of Amounts CapitalizedInterest expense, net of amounts capitalized decreased $4 million, or 0.9%, in 2021 as compared to 2020 primarily due to an increase of $16 million in amounts capitalized largely associated with the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, partially offset by an $11 million increase in interest expense primarily associated with higher average outstanding borrowings. See FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY – ""Sources of Capital"" and ""Financing Activities"" herein and Note 8 to the financial statements for additional information on borrowings and Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Georgia Power – Nuclear Construction"" for additional information regarding Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4.Other Income (Expense), NetOther income (expense), net increased $53 million, or 59.6%, in 2021 as compared to 2020 primarily due to a $50 million increase in non-service cost-related retirement benefits income.

See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Mississippi Power"" for additional information.See ""Energy Sales"" below for a discussion of changes in the volume of energy sold, including changes related to sales and weather.Electric rates for Mississippi Power include provisions to adjust billings for fluctuations in fuel costs, including the energy component of purchased power costs. Under these provisions, fuel revenues generally equal fuel expenses, including the energy component of purchased power costs, and do not affect net income. Recoverable fuel costs include fuel and purchased power expenses reduced by the fuel and emissions portion of wholesale revenues from energy sold to customers outside Mississippi Power's service territory. See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Mississippi Power – Fuel Cost Recovery"" for additional information.Wholesale revenues from power sales to non-affiliated utilities, including FERC-regulated MRA sales as well as market-based sales, were as follows:20212020(in millions)Capacity and other$3 $3 Energy227 212 Total non-affiliated$230 $215 Wholesale revenues from sales to non-affiliates increased $15 million, or 7.0%, compared to 2020. The increase was primarily associated with higher natural gas prices.Wholesale revenues from sales to non-affiliates will vary depending on fuel prices, the market prices of wholesale energy compared to the cost of Mississippi Power's and the Southern Company system's generation, demand for energy within the Southern Company system's electric service territory, and the availability of the Southern Company system's generation. Increases and decreases in energy revenues that are driven by fuel prices are accompanied by an increase or decrease in fuel costs and do not have a significant impact on net income. In addition, Mississippi Power provides service under long-term contracts with rural electric cooperative associations and a municipality located in southeastern Mississippi under full requirements cost-based electric tariffs which are subject to regulation by the FERC. The contracts with these wholesale customers represented 14.3% of II-28 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual ReportMississippi Power's total operating revenues in 2021 and are generally subject to 10-year rolling cancellation notices. Historically, these wholesale customers have acted as a group and any changes in contractual relationships for one customer are likely to be followed by the other wholesale customers. Short-term opportunity energy sales are also included in sales for resale to non-affiliates. These opportunity sales are made at market-based rates that generally provide a margin above Mississippi Power's variable cost to produce the energy.Wholesale revenues from sales to affiliates increased $77 million, or 69.4%, in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to an $86 million increase associated with higher natural gas prices, partially offset by a $10 million decrease associated with lower KWH sales.Wholesale revenues from sales to affiliates will vary depending on demand and the availability and cost of generating resources at each company. These affiliate sales are made in accordance with the IIC, as approved by the FERC. These transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings since this energy is generally sold at marginal cost.Energy SalesChanges in revenues are influenced heavily by the change in the volume of energy sold from year to year.

A portion of the increase in 2021 compared to 2020 reflects cost containment activities implemented to help offset the effects of the recessionary economy resulting from the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. The increase was primarily due to increases of $7 million associated with the Kemper County energy facility (primarily related to increases in dismantlement activities and less salvage proceeds in 2021), $7 million in generation expenses associated with outage and non-outage maintenance, $6 million in distribution operations and maintenance, and $6 million in compensation and benefit expenses.Other Income (Expense), NetOther income (expense), net increased $18 million, or 105.9%, in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to a $9 million decrease in charitable donations and increases of $6 million in non-service cost-related retirement benefits income and $3 million in interest associated with a sales-type lease. See Notes 9 and 11 to the financial statements for additional information.Income TaxesIncome taxes increased $7 million, or 50.0%, in 2021 compared to 2020 due to higher pre-tax earnings and an increase associated with lower flowback of excess deferred income taxes associated with new PEP rates that became effective for the first billing cycle of April 2021.

To the extent Southern Power has capacity not contracted under a PPA, it may sell power into an accessible wholesale market, or, to the extent those generation assets are part of the FERC-approved IIC, it may sell power into the Southern Company power pool.Natural Gas Capacity and Energy RevenueCapacity revenues generally represent the greatest contribution to operating income and are designed to provide recovery of fixed costs plus a return on investment.Energy is generally sold at variable cost or is indexed to published natural gas indices. Energy revenues will vary depending on the energy demand of Southern Power's customers and their generation capacity, as well as the market prices of wholesale energy compared to the cost of Southern Power's energy. Energy revenues also include fees for support services, fuel storage, and unit start charges. Increases and decreases in energy revenues under PPAs that are driven by fuel or purchased power prices are accompanied by an increase or decrease in fuel and purchased power costs and do not have a significant impact on net income.Solar and Wind Energy RevenueSouthern Power's energy sales from solar and wind generating facilities are predominantly through long-term PPAs that do not have capacity revenue. Customers either purchase the energy output of a dedicated renewable facility through an energy charge or pay a fixed price related to the energy generated from the respective facility and sold to the grid. As a result, Southern Power's ability to recover fixed and variable operations and maintenance expenses is dependent upon the level of energy generated from these facilities, which can be impacted by weather conditions, equipment performance, transmission constraints, and other factors.

The increase in operating revenues was primarily due to the following:•PPA capacity revenues increased $24 million, or 6%, primarily due to a net increase in sales associated with new natural gas PPAs and increased capacity sales under existing natural gas PPAs.•PPA energy revenues increased $292 million, or 29%, primarily due to an increase in sales under existing natural gas PPAs resulting from a $206 million increase in the price of fuel and purchased power and a $79 million net increase in sales associated with new natural gas PPAs. Also contributing to the increase was $15 million related to new wind PPAs which began during 2020 and 2021, partially offset by an $11 million decrease in sales under existing wind PPAs.•Non-PPA revenues increased $151 million, or 48%, due to a $197 million increase in the market price of energy, partially offset by a $46 million decrease in the volume of KWHs sold through short-term sales.•Other revenues increased $16 million, or 114%, primarily due to transmission revenues related to new PPAs.Fuel and Purchased Power ExpensesDetails of Southern Power's generation and purchased power were as follows:TotalKWHsTotal KWH % ChangeTotalKWHs20212020(in billions of KWHs)Generation4444Purchased power33Total generation and purchased power47—%47Total generation and purchased power (excluding solar, wind, fuel cells, and tolling agreements)28—%28Southern Power's PPAs for natural gas generation generally provide that the purchasers are responsible for either procuring the fuel (tolling agreements) or reimbursing Southern Power for substantially all of the cost of fuel relating to the energy delivered under such PPAs. Consequently, changes in such fuel costs are generally accompanied by a corresponding change in related fuel revenues and do not have a significant impact on net income. Southern Power is responsible for the cost of fuel for generating units that are not covered under PPAs. Power from these generating units is sold into the wholesale market or into the Southern Company power pool for capacity owned directly by Southern Power.Purchased power expenses will vary depending on demand, availability, and the cost of generating resources throughout the Southern Company system and other contract resources. Load requirements are submitted to the Southern Company power pool on an hourly basis and are fulfilled with the lowest cost alternative, whether that is generation owned by Southern Power, an affiliate company, or external parties. Such purchased power costs are generally recovered through PPA revenues.II-32 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual ReportDetails of Southern Power's fuel and purchased power expenses were as follows:20212020(in millions)Fuel$802 $470 Purchased power139 74 Total fuel and purchased power expenses$941 $544 In 2021, total fuel and purchased power expenses increased $397 million, or 73%, compared to 2020. Fuel expense increased $332 million, or 71%, primarily due to an increase in the average cost of fuel. Purchased power expense increased $65 million, or 88%, due to an increase associated with the average cost of purchased power.Other Operations and Maintenance ExpensesIn 2021, other operations and maintenance expenses increased $70 million, or 20%, compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to increases of $21 million in scheduled outage and maintenance expenses, $15 million in transmission expenses primarily related to new PPAs, $10 million in compensation and benefit expenses, $8 million in expenses associated with new wind facilities placed in service during 2020 and 2021, and $5 million related to the allocation of uncollected settlements by the Energy Reliability Council of Texas market as a result of Winter Storm Uri.Depreciation and AmortizationIn 2021, depreciation and amortization increased $23 million, or 5%, compared to 2020 primarily due to new wind facilities placed in service during 2020 and 2021.Loss on Sales-Type LeasesIn 2021, a $40 million loss on sales-type leases was recorded upon commencement of the Garland and Tranquillity battery energy storage facilities' PPAs, $26 million of which was allocated through noncontrolling interests to Southern Power's partners in the projects. The loss was due to ITCs retained and expected to be realized by Southern Power and its partners. See Notes 9 and 15 to the financial statements under ""Lessor"" and ""Southern Power,"" respectively, for additional information.Gain on Dispositions, NetIn 2021, gain on dispositions, net increased $2 million, or 5%, compared to 2020. Gains on dispositions totaled $41 million in 2021 primarily due to contributions of wind turbine equipment to various equity method investments in the first quarter 2021. A $39 million gain was also recorded in the first quarter 2020 related to the sale of Plant Mankato. See Notes 7 and 15 to the financial statements under ""Southern Power"" and ""Southern Power – Sales of Natural Gas and Biomass Plants,"" respectively, for additional information.Other Income (Expense), NetIn 2021, other income (expense), net decreased $9 million, or 47%, compared to 2020 primarily due to a $12 million gain recorded in the third quarter 2020 associated with the Roserock solar facility litigation.Income Taxes (Benefit)In 2021, income tax benefit was $13 million compared to income tax expense of $3 million for 2020, a change of $16 million. The change was primarily due to changes in state apportionment methodology resulting from tax legislation enacted by the State of Alabama in February 2021 and the tax impact from the sale of Plant Mankato in January 2020. See Notes 1, 10, and 15 to the financial statements under ""Income Taxes,"" ""Effective Tax Rate,"" and ""Southern Power,"" respectively, for additional information.Net Loss Attributable to Noncontrolling InterestsIn 2021, net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests increased $68 million compared to 2020. The increased loss was primarily due to loss allocations to the partners in the Garland and Tranquillity battery energy storage facilities, including $26 million allocated from the loss on sales-type leases. In addition, the increased loss was due to higher HLBV loss allocations to wind tax equity partners, including new partnerships entered into during 2020 and 2021, and lower income allocations to solar equity partners, totaling $29 million. See Notes 9 and 15 to the financial statements under ""Lessor"" and ""Southern Power,"" respectively, for additional information.II-33 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual ReportSouthern Company GasOperating MetricsSouthern Company Gas continues to focus on several operating metrics, including Heating Degree Days, customer count, and volumes of natural gas sold.Southern Company Gas measures weather and the effect on its business using Heating Degree Days. Generally, increased Heating Degree Days result in higher demand for natural gas on Southern Company Gas' distribution system. Southern Company Gas has various regulatory mechanisms, such as weather and revenue normalization and straight-fixed-variable rate design, which limit its exposure to weather changes within typical ranges in each of its utility's respective service territory. Southern Company Gas also utilizes weather hedges to limit the negative income impacts in the event of warmer-than-normal weather.The number of customers served by gas distribution operations and gas marketing services can be impacted by natural gas prices, economic conditions, and competition from alternative fuels. Gas distribution operations and gas marketing services' customers are primarily located in Georgia and Illinois.Southern Company Gas' natural gas volume metrics for gas distribution operations and gas marketing services illustrate the effects of weather and customer demand for natural gas. Wholesale gas services' physical sales volumes represent the daily average natural gas volumes sold to its customers.Seasonality of ResultsDuring the Heating Season, natural gas usage and operating revenues are generally higher as more customers are connected to the gas distribution systems and natural gas usage is higher in periods of colder weather. Prior to the sale of Sequent on July 1, 2021, wholesale gas services' operating revenues occasionally were impacted due to peak usage by power generators in response to summer energy demands. Southern Company Gas' base operating expenses, excluding cost of natural gas, bad debt expense, and certain incentive compensation costs, are incurred relatively evenly throughout the year. Seasonality also affects the comparison of certain balance sheet items across quarters, including receivables, unbilled revenues, natural gas for sale, and notes payable. However, these items are comparable when reviewing Southern Company Gas' annual results. Thus, Southern Company Gas' operating results can vary significantly from quarter to quarter as a result of seasonality, which is illustrated in the table below.Percent Generated DuringHeating SeasonOperating RevenuesNetIncome202170 %102 %202068 %86 %Net IncomeNet income attributable to Southern Company Gas in 2021 was $539 million, a decrease of $51 million, or 8.6%, compared to 2020. The decrease was primarily due to $85 million of deferred income taxes and an $80 million decrease at gas pipeline investments primarily due to impairment charges related to the PennEast Pipeline project, partially offset by a $93 million increase at wholesale gas services primarily due to the gain on the sale of Sequent and a $22 million increase at gas distribution operations primarily due to base rate increases and continued investment in infrastructure replacement. See Note 7 to the financial statements under ""Southern Company Gas"" for additional information on the PennEast Pipeline project and Note 15 to the financial statements under ""Southern Company Gas"" for additional information on the sale of Sequent.II-34 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual ReportA condensed income statement for Southern Company Gas follows:2021Increase (Decrease) from 2020(in millions)Operating revenues$4,380 $946 Cost of natural gas1,619 647 Other operations and maintenance1,072 106 Depreciation and amortization536 36 Taxes other than income taxes225 19 Gain on dispositions, net (127)(105)Total operating expenses3,325 703 Operating income1,055 243 Earnings from equity method investments50 (91)Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized238 7 Other income (expense), net(53)(94)Income taxes275 102 Net Income$539 $(51)Operating RevenuesOperating revenues in 2021 were $4.4 billion, reflecting a $946 million, or 27.5%, increase compared to 2020.

See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Southern Company Gas"" for additional information.Revenues associated with gas costs and other cost recovery increased in 2021 primarily due to higher natural gas cost recovery as a result of higher volumes of natural gas sold and an increase in natural gas prices. The natural gas distribution utilities have weather or revenue normalization mechanisms that mitigate revenue fluctuations from customer consumption changes. Natural gas distribution rates include provisions to adjust billings for fluctuations in natural gas costs. Therefore, gas costs recovered through natural gas revenues generally equal the amount expensed in cost of natural gas and do not affect net income from gas distribution operations. See ""Cost of Natural Gas"" herein for additional information.Revenues from wholesale gas services increased in 2021 primarily due to higher volumes of natural gas sold and higher commercial activities as a result of Winter Storm Uri, partially offset by derivative losses, all prior to the sale of Sequent. See ""Segment Information – Wholesale Gas Services"" herein and Note 15 to the financial statements under ""Southern Company Gas"" for additional information.Heating Degree DaysSouthern Company Gas' natural gas distribution utilities have various regulatory mechanisms that limit their exposure to weather changes. Southern Company Gas also uses hedges for any remaining exposure to warmer-than-normal weather in Illinois for gas II-35 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual Reportdistribution operations and in Illinois and Georgia for gas marketing services; therefore, weather typically does not have a significant net income impact.

December 31, 2020 also includes approximately 50,000 customers in Ohio contracted through an annual auction process to serve for 12 months beginning April 1, 2020.Southern Company Gas anticipates customer growth and uses a variety of targeted marketing programs to attract new customers and to retain existing customers.Cost of Natural Gas Excluding Atlanta Gas Light, which does not sell natural gas to end-use customers, gas distribution operations charges its utility customers for natural gas consumed using natural gas cost recovery mechanisms set by the applicable state regulatory agencies. Under these mechanisms, all prudently-incurred natural gas costs are passed through to customers without markup, subject to regulatory review. Gas distribution operations defers or accrues the difference between the actual cost of natural gas and the amount of commodity revenue earned in a given period. The deferred or accrued amount is either billed or refunded to customers prospectively through adjustments to the commodity rate. Deferred natural gas costs are reflected as regulatory assets and accrued natural gas costs are reflected as regulatory liabilities. Therefore, gas costs recovered through natural gas revenues generally equal the amount expensed in cost of natural gas and do not affect net income from gas distribution operations. Cost of natural gas at gas distribution operations represented 86.3% of the total cost of natural gas for 2021.Gas marketing services customers are charged for actual and estimated natural gas consumed. Cost of natural gas includes the cost of fuel and associated transportation costs, lost and unaccounted for gas, adjustments to reduce the value of inventories to market value, if applicable, and gains and losses associated with certain derivatives.In 2021, cost of natural gas was $1.6 billion, an increase of $647 million, or 66.6%, compared to 2020, which reflects higher gas cost recovery in 2021 as a result of higher volumes sold and a 91.2% increase in natural gas prices compared to 2020.II-36 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual ReportVolumes of Natural Gas SoldThe following table details the volumes of natural gas sold during all periods presented.2021 vs. 202020212020% ChangeGas distribution operations (mmBtu in millions)Firm656 623 5.3 %Interruptible98 92 6.5 Total754 715 5.5 %Wholesale gas services (mmBtu in millions/day)Daily physical sales(*)6.6 6.9 (4.3)%Gas marketing services (mmBtu in millions)Firm:Georgia34 33 3.0 %Illinois7 9 (22.2)Other 11 13 (15.4)Interruptible large commercial and industrial14 14 — Total66 69 (4.3)%(*) Daily physical sales for 2021 reflect amounts through the sale of Sequent on July 1, 2021.Other Operations and Maintenance ExpensesIn 2021, other operations and maintenance expenses increased $106 million, or 11.0%, compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to increases of $60 million in compensation expenses, $30 million of which was at Sequent, $10 million in facility costs, and $10 million in bad debt expense, which is passed through directly to customers and has no impact on net income.Depreciation and AmortizationIn 2021, depreciation and amortization increased $36 million, or 7.2%, compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to continued infrastructure investments at the natural gas distribution utilities. See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Southern Company Gas – Infrastructure Replacement Programs and Capital Projects"" for additional information.Taxes Other Than Income TaxesIn 2021, taxes other than income taxes increased $19 million, or 9.2%, compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to a $15 million increase in revenue tax expenses as a result of higher natural gas revenues at Nicor Gas, which are passed through directly to customers and have no impact on net income.Gain on Dispositions, NetIn 2021, gain on dispositions, net increased $105 million compared to 2020. In 2021, Southern Company Gas recorded a $121 million gain on the sale of Sequent, as well as an additional $5 million gain from the sale of Pivotal LNG. In 2020, Southern Company Gas recorded a $22 million gain on the sale of Jefferson Island. See Note 15 to the financial statements under ""Southern Company Gas"" for additional information.Earnings from Equity Method InvestmentsIn 2021, earnings from equity method investments decreased $91 million, or 64.5%, compared to 2020. The decrease was primarily due to impairment charges in 2021 totaling $84 million related to the PennEast Pipeline project. See Note 7 to the financial statements under ""Southern Company Gas"" for additional information.Other Income (Expense), NetIn 2021, other income (expense), net decreased $94 million compared to 2020. The decrease was largely due to $101 million in charitable contributions by Sequent prior to its sale.II-37 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual ReportIncome TaxesIn 2021, income taxes increased $102 million, or 59.0%, compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to $114 million in additional tax expense resulting from the sale of Sequent, including changes in state tax apportionment rates, and higher pre-tax earnings at gas distribution operations, partially offset by $18 million of tax benefit resulting from the PennEast Pipeline project impairment charges in the second and third quarters of 2021 at gas pipeline investments.

These agencies approve natural gas rates designed to provide Southern Company Gas with the opportunity to generate revenues to recover the cost of natural gas delivered to its customers and its fixed and variable costs, including depreciation, interest expense, operations and maintenance, taxes, and overhead costs, and to earn a reasonable return on its investments.With the exception of Atlanta Gas Light, Southern Company Gas' second largest utility that operates in a deregulated natural gas market and has a straight-fixed-variable rate design that minimizes the variability of its revenues based on consumption, the earnings of the natural gas distribution utilities can be affected by customer consumption patterns that are a function of weather conditions, price levels for natural gas, and general economic conditions that may impact customers' ability to pay for natural gas consumed. Southern Company Gas has various regulatory and other mechanisms, such as weather and revenue normalization mechanisms and weather derivative instruments, that limit its exposure to changes in customer consumption, including weather changes within typical ranges in its natural gas distribution utilities' service territories.In 2021, net income increased $22 million, or 5.6%, compared to 2020. Operating revenues increased $727 million primarily due to higher gas cost recovery, rate increases, and continued investment in infrastructure replacement. Gas costs recovered through natural gas revenues generally equal the amount expensed in cost of natural gas. Operating expenses increased $674 million primarily due to a $540 million increase in cost of gas as a result of higher natural gas prices and higher volumes sold, largely as a result of colder weather in the first quarter 2021 compared to 2020, higher depreciation resulting from additional assets placed in service, higher taxes other than income taxes due to higher pass through taxes, and higher compensation expenses. Other income and expense decreased $10 million primarily due to a decrease in non-service cost-related retirement benefits income. Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized increased $15 million primarily due to additional debt issued to finance continued investments. Income taxes increased $6 million primarily due to higher pre-tax earnings.See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Southern Company Gas – Rate Proceedings"" and "" – Infrastructure Replacement Programs and Capital Projects"" for additional information. Also see Note 11 to the financial statements for additional information on retirement benefits.II-38 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual ReportGas Pipeline InvestmentsGas pipeline investments consists primarily of joint ventures in natural gas pipeline investments including SNG, PennEast Pipeline, Dalton Pipeline, and Atlantic Coast Pipeline (until its sale on March 24, 2020). In 2021, net income decreased $80 million, or 80.8%, compared to 2020. The decrease was primarily due to impairment charges totaling $84 million ($67 million after tax) related to the PennEast Pipeline project. See Note 7 to the financial statements under ""Southern Company Gas"" for information regarding the September 2021 cancellation of the PennEast Pipeline project.Wholesale Gas ServicesPrior to the sale of Sequent, wholesale gas services was involved in asset management and optimization, storage, transportation, producer and peaking services, natural gas supply, natural gas services, and wholesale gas marketing. Southern Company Gas positioned the business to generate positive economic earnings on an annual basis even under low volatility market conditions that can result from a number of factors. When market price volatility increased, wholesale gas services was positioned to capture significant value and generate stronger results. Operating expenses primarily reflected employee compensation and benefits. See Note 15 to the financial statements under ""Southern Company Gas"" for information regarding the sale of Sequent.In 2021, net income increased $93 million compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to a $114 million increase in operating revenues due to higher commercial activity driven by natural gas price volatility that was generated by cold weather, partially offset by unfavorable storage and transportation derivatives due to widening transportation spreads, as well as a $121 million gain on the sale of Sequent, partially offset by a $14 million increase in other operating expenses primarily related to an increase in variable compensation, a $101 million decrease in other income and (expense) related to higher charitable contributions, and a $29 million increase in income tax expense due to higher pre-tax earnings.Gas Marketing ServicesGas marketing services provides energy-related products and services to natural gas markets and participants in customer choice programs that were approved in various states to increase competition. These programs allow customers to choose their natural gas supplier while the local distribution utility continues to provide distribution and transportation services. Gas marketing services is weather sensitive and uses a variety of hedging strategies, such as weather derivative instruments and other risk management tools, to partially mitigate potential weather impacts.In 2021, net income decreased $1 million, or 1.1%, compared to 2020. The decrease was primarily due to an increase in operating expenses primarily related to a $73 million increase in the cost of gas in 2021 resulting from higher natural gas prices, largely offset by a $67 million increase in operating revenues due to higher natural gas prices and increased retail price spreads.All OtherAll other includes natural gas storage businesses, including Jefferson Island through its sale on December 1, 2020, fuels operations through the sale of Southern Company Gas' interest in Pivotal LNG on March 24, 2020, AGL Services Company, and Southern Company Gas Capital, as well as various corporate operating expenses that are not allocated to the reportable segments and interest income (expense) associated with affiliate financing arrangements.In 2021, net loss increased $85 million compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to additional tax expense due to changes in state apportionment rates as a result of the sale of Sequent. See Note 10 to the financial statements and Note 15 to the financial statements under ""Southern Company Gas"" for additional information.FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIALGeneralPrices for electric service provided by the traditional electric operating companies and natural gas distributed by the natural gas distribution utilities to retail customers are set by state PSCs or other applicable state regulatory agencies under cost-based regulatory principles. Retail rates and earnings are reviewed through various regulatory mechanisms and/or processes and may be adjusted periodically within certain limitations. Effectively operating pursuant to these regulatory mechanisms and/or processes and appropriately balancing required costs and capital expenditures with customer prices will continue to challenge the traditional electric operating companies and natural gas distribution utilities for the foreseeable future. Prices for wholesale electricity sales, interconnecting transmission lines, and the exchange of electric power are regulated by the FERC. Southern Power continues to focus on long-term PPAs. See ACCOUNTING POLICIES – ""Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – Utility Regulation"" herein and Note 2 to the financial statements for additional information about regulatory matters.II-39 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual ReportEach Registrant's results of operations are not necessarily indicative of its future earnings potential. The disposition activities described in Note 15 to the financial statements have reduced earnings for the applicable Registrants. The level of the Registrants' future earnings depends on numerous factors that affect the opportunities, challenges, and risks of the Registrants' primary businesses of selling electricity and/or distributing natural gas, as described further herein.For the traditional electric operating companies, these factors include the ability to maintain constructive regulatory environments that allow for the timely recovery of prudently-incurred costs during a time of increasing costs, including those related to projected long-term demand growth, stringent environmental standards, including CCR rules, safety, system reliability and resiliency, fuel, restoration following major storms, and capital expenditures, including constructing new electric generating plants and expanding and improving the transmission and distribution systems; continued customer growth; and the trend of reduced electricity usage per customer, especially in residential and commercial markets. For Georgia Power, completing construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 and the related cost recovery proceedings is another major factor.Earnings in the electricity business will also depend upon maintaining and growing sales, considering, among other things, the adoption and/or penetration rates of increasingly energy-efficient technologies and increasing volumes of electronic commerce transactions, which could contribute to a net reduction in customer usage.Global and U.S. economic conditions have been significantly affected by a series of demand and supply shocks that caused a global and national economic recession in 2020. Most prominently, the COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted global supply chains and business operations as suppliers continue to experience difficulties keeping up with strong demand for factory goods, which is being driven by low business inventories. In addition, rising inflation in 2021 and 2022 has resulted in increasing costs for many goods and services. The combination of rising inoculation rates in the U.S. population and the federal COVID-19 relief package contributed to increased economic recovery in 2021; however, fiscal support of business and personal incomes is declining. The drivers, speed, and depth of the 2020 economic contraction were unprecedented and have reduced energy demand across the Southern Company system's service territory, primarily in the commercial and industrial classes. Retail electric revenues attributable to changes in sales increased in 2021 when compared to 2020 primarily due to the normalization of economic activity; however, retail electric sales continued to be negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic when compared to pre-pandemic trends. Recovery is expected to continue in 2022, but the impacts of new COVID-19 variants, as well as responses to the COVID-19 pandemic by both customers and governments, could significantly affect the pace of recovery. The ultimate extent of the negative impact on revenues depends on the depth and duration of the economic contraction in the Southern Company system's service territory and cannot be determined at this time. See RESULTS OF OPERATIONS herein for information on COVID-19-related impacts on energy demand in the Southern Company system's service territory during 2021.The level of future earnings for Southern Power's competitive wholesale electric business depends on numerous factors including the parameters of the wholesale market and the efficient operation of its wholesale generating assets; Southern Power's ability to execute its growth strategy through the development or acquisition of renewable facilities and other energy projects while containing costs; regulatory matters; customer creditworthiness; total electric generating capacity available in Southern Power's market areas; Southern Power's ability to successfully remarket capacity as current contracts expire; renewable portfolio standards; availability of federal and state ITCs and PTCs, which could be impacted by future tax legislation; transmission constraints; cost of generation from units within the Southern Company power pool; and operational limitations. See ""Income Tax Matters"" herein, Note 10 to the financial statements, and Note 15 to the financial statements under ""Southern Power"" for additional information.The level of future earnings for Southern Company Gas' primary business of distributing natural gas and its complementary businesses in the gas pipeline investments and gas marketing services sectors depends on numerous factors. These factors include the natural gas distribution utilities' ability to maintain constructive regulatory environments that allow for the timely recovery of prudently-incurred costs, including those related to projected long-term demand growth, safety, system reliability and resilience, natural gas, and capital expenditures, including expanding and improving the natural gas distribution systems; the completion and subsequent operation of ongoing infrastructure and other construction projects; customer creditworthiness; certain city-wide bans on the use of natural gas in new construction; and Southern Company Gas' ability to re-contract storage rates at favorable prices. The volatility of natural gas prices has an impact on Southern Company Gas' customer rates, its long-term competitive position against other energy sources, and the ability of Southern Company Gas' gas marketing services business to capture value from locational and seasonal spreads. Additionally, changes in commodity prices, primarily driven by tight gas supplies and diminished gas production, subject a portion of Southern Company Gas' operations to earnings variability. Additional economic factors may contribute to this environment. If current economic conditions continue to improve, the demand for natural gas may increase, which may cause natural gas prices to rise and drive higher volatility in the natural gas markets on a longer-term basis. Alternatively, a significant drop in oil and natural gas prices could lead to a consolidation of natural gas producers or reduced levels of natural gas production.II-40 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual ReportEarnings for both the electricity and natural gas businesses are subject to a variety of other factors. These factors include weather, competition, developing new and maintaining existing energy contracts and associated load requirements with wholesale customers, energy conservation practiced by customers, the use of alternative energy sources by customers, government incentives to reduce overall energy usage, the prices of electricity and natural gas, and the price elasticity of demand. Demand for electricity and natural gas in the Registrants' service territories is primarily driven by the pace of economic growth or decline that may be affected by changes in regional and global economic conditions, which may impact future earnings.Mississippi Power provides service under long-term contracts with rural electric cooperative associations and a municipality located in southeastern Mississippi under full requirements cost-based electric tariffs which are subject to regulation by the FERC. The contracts with these wholesale customers represented 14.3% of Mississippi Power's total operating revenues in 2021 and are generally subject to 10-year rolling cancellation notices. Historically, these wholesale customers have acted as a group and any changes in contractual relationships for one customer are likely to be followed by the other wholesale customers.As part of its ongoing effort to adapt to changing market conditions, Southern Company continues to evaluate and consider a wide array of potential business strategies. These strategies may include business combinations, partnerships, and acquisitions involving other utility or non-utility businesses or properties, disposition of, or the sale of interests in, certain assets or businesses, internal restructuring, or some combination thereof. Furthermore, Southern Company may engage in new business ventures that arise from competitive and regulatory changes in the utility industry. Pursuit of any of the above strategies, or any combination thereof, may significantly affect the business operations, risks, and financial condition of Southern Company. In addition, Southern Power and Southern Company Gas regularly consider and evaluate joint development arrangements as well as acquisitions and dispositions of businesses and assets as part of their business strategies. See Note 15 to the financial statements for additional information.Environmental MattersThe Southern Company system's operations are regulated by state and federal environmental agencies through a variety of laws and regulations governing air, water, land, avian and other wildlife and habitat protection, and other natural resources. The Southern Company system maintains comprehensive environmental compliance and GHG strategies to assess both current and upcoming requirements and compliance costs associated with these environmental laws and regulations. New or revised environmental laws and regulations could further affect many areas of operations for the Subsidiary Registrants. The costs required to comply with environmental laws and regulations and to achieve stated goals, including capital expenditures, operations and maintenance costs, and costs reflected in ARO liabilities, may impact future electric generating unit retirement and replacement decisions (which are subject to approval from the traditional electric operating companies' respective state PSCs), results of operations, cash flows, and/or financial condition. Related costs may result from the installation of additional environmental controls, closure and monitoring of CCR facilities, unit retirements, or changing fuel sources for certain existing units, as well as related upgrades to the Southern Company system's transmission and distribution (electric and natural gas) systems. A major portion of these costs is expected to be recovered through retail and wholesale rates, including existing ratemaking and billing provisions. The ultimate impact of environmental laws and regulations and the GHG goals discussed herein cannot be determined at this time and will depend on various factors, such as state adoption and implementation of requirements, the availability and cost of any deployed technology, fuel prices, the outcome of pending and/or future legal challenges, and the ability to continue recovering the related costs, through rates for the traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities or through long-term wholesale agreements for the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power.Alabama Power and Mississippi Power recover environmental compliance costs through separate mechanisms, Rate CNP Compliance and the ECO Plan, respectively. Georgia Power's base rates include an ECCR tariff that allows for the recovery of environmental compliance costs. The natural gas distribution utilities of Southern Company Gas generally recover environmental remediation expenditures through rate mechanisms approved by their applicable state regulatory agencies. See Notes 2 and 3 to the financial statements for additional information.Southern Power's PPAs generally contain provisions that permit charging the counterparty with some of the new costs incurred as a result of changes in environmental laws and regulations. Since Southern Power's units are generally newer natural gas and renewable generating facilities, costs associated with environmental compliance for these facilities have been less significant than for similarly situated coal or older natural gas generating facilities. Environmental, natural resource, and land use concerns, including the applicability of air quality limitations, the potential presence of wetlands or threatened and endangered species, the availability of water withdrawal rights, uncertainties regarding impacts such as increased light or noise, and concerns about potential adverse health impacts can, however, increase the cost of siting and operating any type of future facility. The impact of such laws, regulations, and other considerations on Southern Power and subsequent recovery through PPA provisions cannot be determined at this time.II-41 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual ReportFurther, increased costs that are recovered through regulated rates could contribute to reduced demand for electricity and natural gas, which could negatively affect results of operations, cash flows, and/or financial condition. Additionally, many commercial and industrial customers may also be affected by existing and future environmental requirements, which may have the potential to affect their demand for electricity and natural gas.Although the timing, requirements, and estimated costs could change as environmental laws and regulations are adopted or modified, as compliance plans are revised or updated, and as legal challenges to rules are initiated or completed, estimated capital expenditures through 2026 based on the current environmental compliance strategy for the Southern Company system and the traditional electric operating companies are as follows:20222023202420252026Total(in millions)Southern Company$98 $111 $146 $72 $58 $485 Alabama Power49 35 50 33 28 195 Georgia Power37 75 91 34 25 262 Mississippi Power12 1 5 5 5 28 These estimates do not include any costs associated with potential regulation of GHG emissions. See ""Global Climate Issues"" herein for additional information. The Southern Company system also anticipates substantial expenditures associated with ash pond closure and groundwater monitoring under the CCR Rule and related state rules, which are reflected in the applicable Registrants' ARO liabilities. See FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY – ""Cash Requirements"" herein and Note 6 to the financial statements for additional information.Environmental Laws and RegulationsAir QualityThe Southern Company system reduced SO2 and NOX air emissions by 99% and 93%, respectively, from 1990 to 2020. The Southern Company system reduced mercury air emissions by 98% from 2005 to 2020.The EPA finalized regional haze regulations in 2005 and 2017. These regulations require states and various federal agencies to develop and implement plans to reduce pollutants that impair visibility and demonstrate reasonable progress toward the goal of restoring natural visibility conditions in certain areas, including national parks and wilderness areas. States were required to submit state implementation plans for the second 10-year planning period (2018 through 2028) by July 31, 2021; however, plans have not yet been submitted by the applicable states in the Southern Company system's service territory. These plans could require further reductions in particulate matter, SO2, and/or NOX, which could result in increased compliance costs at affected electric generating units.Water QualityIn 2014, the EPA finalized requirements under Section 316(b) of the Clean Water Act (CWA) to regulate cooling water intake structures (CWIS) to minimize their effects on fish and other aquatic life at existing power plants. The regulation requires plant-specific studies to determine applicable CWIS changes to protect organisms. The results of these plant-specific studies, which are ongoing within the Southern Company system, are being submitted with each plant's next National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit cycle. The Southern Company system anticipates applicable CWIS changes may include fish-friendly CWIS screens with fish return systems and minor additions of monitoring equipment at certain plants. The impact of this rule will depend on the outcome of these plant-specific studies, any additional protective measures required to be incorporated into each plant's NPDES permit based on site-specific factors, and the outcome of any legal challenges.In October 2020, the EPA published the final steam electric ELG reconsideration rule (ELG Reconsideration Rule), a reconsideration of the 2015 ELG rule's limits on bottom ash transport water and flue gas desulfurization wastewater that extends the latest applicability date for both discharges to December 31, 2025. The ELG Reconsideration Rule also updates the voluntary incentive program and provides new subcategories for low utilization electric generating units and electric generating units that will permanently cease coal combustion by 2028. As required by the ELG Reconsideration Rule, on October 13, 2021, Alabama Power and Georgia Power each submitted initial notices of planned participation (NOPP) for applicable units seeking to qualify for these subcategories.Alabama Power submitted its NOPP to the Alabama Department of Environmental Management (ADEM) indicating plans to retire Plant Barry Unit 5 (700 MWs) and to cease using coal and begin operating solely on natural gas at Plant Barry Unit 4 (350 II-42 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual ReportMWs) and Plant Gaston Unit 5 (880 MWs). Alabama Power, as agent for SEGCO, indicated plans to retire Plant Gaston Units 1 through 4 (1,000 MWs). These plans are expected to be completed on or before the compliance date of December 31, 2028. The NOPP submittals are subject to the review of the ADEM. Retirement of Plant Barry Unit 5 could occur as early as 2023, subject to completion of the acquisition of the Calhoun Generating Station and certain operating conditions. See Notes 2 and 7 to the financial statements under ""Alabama Power – Certificates of Convenience and Necessity"" and ""SEGCO,"" respectively, for additional information.The assets for which Alabama Power has indicated retirement, due to early closure or repowering of the unit to natural gas, have net book values totaling approximately $1.5 billion (excluding capitalized asset retirement costs which are recovered through Rate CNP Compliance) at December 31, 2021. Based on an Alabama PSC order, Alabama Power is authorized to establish a regulatory asset to record the unrecovered investment costs, including the plant asset balance and the site removal and closure costs, associated with unit retirements caused by environmental regulations (Environmental Accounting Order). Under the Environmental Accounting Order, the regulatory asset would be amortized and recovered over an affected unit's remaining useful life, as established prior to the decision regarding early retirement, through Rate CNP Compliance. See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Alabama Power – Rate CNP Compliance"" and "" – Environmental Accounting Order"" for additional information.Georgia Power submitted its NOPP to the Georgia Environmental Protection Division (EPD) indicating plans to retire Plant Wansley Units 1 and 2 (926 MWs based on 53.5% ownership), Plant Bowen Units 1 and 2 (1,400 MWs), and Plant Scherer Unit 3 (614 MWs based on 75% ownership) on or before the compliance date of December 31, 2028. Georgia Power intends to pursue compliance with the ELG Reconsideration Rule for Plant Scherer Units 1 and 2 (137 MWs based on 8.4% ownership) through the voluntary incentive program by no later than December 31, 2028. Georgia Power intends to comply with the ELG Rules for Plant Bowen Units 3 and 4 through the generally applicable requirements by December 31, 2025; therefore, no NOPP submission was required for these units. The NOPP submittals and generally applicable requirements are subject to the review of the Georgia EPD.The units for which Georgia Power has indicated early retirement plans have net book values totaling approximately $2.2 billion (excluding capitalized asset retirement costs which are recovered through the ECCR tariff) at December 31, 2021. A final decision regarding the future operation of Georgia Power's impacted units and the timing of any retirements are subject to review by the Georgia PSC as a part of Georgia Power's 2022 IRP proceeding. See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Georgia Power – Integrated Resource Plan"" for additional information.The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.The ELG Reconsideration Rule is expected to require capital expenditures and increased operational costs for the traditional electric operating companies and SEGCO. However, the ultimate impact of the ELG Reconsideration Rule will depend on the Southern Company system's final assessment of compliance options, the incorporation of these assessments into each of the traditional electric operating company's IRP process, the incorporation of these new requirements into each plant's NPDES permit, and the outcome of legal challenges. The ELG Reconsideration Rule has been challenged by several environmental organizations and the cases have been consolidated in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. The case is being held in abeyance while the EPA undertakes a new rulemaking to revise the ELG Reconsideration Rule. A proposed rule is expected in the fall of 2022. Any revisions could require changes in the traditional electric operating companies' compliance strategies.Coal Combustion ResidualsIn 2015, the EPA finalized non-hazardous solid waste regulations for the management and disposal of CCR, including coal ash and gypsum, in landfills and surface impoundments (ash ponds) at active electric generating power plants. The CCR Rule requires landfills and ash ponds to be evaluated against a set of performance criteria and potentially closed if certain criteria are not met. Closure of existing landfills and ash ponds requires installation of equipment and infrastructure to manage CCR in accordance with the CCR Rule. In addition to the federal CCR Rule, the States of Alabama and Georgia finalized state regulations regarding the management and disposal of CCR within their respective states. In 2019, the State of Georgia received partial approval from the EPA for its state CCR permitting program. The State of Mississippi has not developed a state CCR permit program.The Holistic Approach to Closure: Part A rule, finalized in August 2020, revised the deadline to stop sending CCR and non-CCR wastes to unlined surface impoundments to April 11, 2021 and established a process for the EPA to approve extensions to the deadline. The traditional electric operating companies stopped sending CCR and non-CCR wastes to their unlined impoundments prior to April 11, 2021 and, therefore, did not submit requests for extensions. On January 11, 2022, the EPA proposed determinations on deadline extension requests for other non-affiliated facilities, which reflected its positions on a variety of CCR Rule compliance requirements including closure standards, groundwater monitoring, and corrective action. The traditional electric operating companies are in the process of reviewing these determinations to determine how the EPA's current positions may II-43 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual Reportimpact their closure plans and groundwater monitoring efforts. The ultimate impact of the EPA's announced positions on the traditional electric operating companies cannot be determined at this time, but may be material.Based on requirements for closure and monitoring of landfills and ash ponds pursuant to the CCR Rule and applicable state rules, the traditional electric operating companies have periodically updated, and expect to continue periodically updating, their related cost estimates and ARO liabilities for each CCR unit as additional information related to closure methodologies, schedules, and/or costs becomes available. Some of these updates have been, and future updates may be, material. Additionally, the closure designs and plans in the States of Alabama and Georgia are subject to approval by environmental regulatory agencies. Absent continued recovery of ARO costs through regulated rates, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition for Southern Company and the traditional electric operating companies could be materially impacted. See FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY – ""Cash Requirements,"" Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Georgia Power – Rate Plans,"" and Note 6 to the financial statements for additional information.Environmental RemediationThe Southern Company system must comply with environmental laws and regulations governing the handling and disposal of waste and releases of hazardous substances. Under these various laws and regulations, the Southern Company system could incur substantial costs to clean up affected sites. The traditional electric operating companies and Southern Company Gas conduct studies to determine the extent of any required cleanup and have recognized the estimated costs to clean up known impacted sites in their financial statements. Amounts for cleanup and ongoing monitoring costs were not material for any year presented. The traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities in Illinois and Georgia (which represent substantially all of Southern Company Gas' accrued remediation costs) have all received authority from their respective state PSCs or other applicable state regulatory agencies to recover approved environmental remediation costs through regulatory mechanisms. These regulatory mechanisms are adjusted annually or as necessary within limits approved by the state PSCs or other applicable state regulatory agencies. The traditional electric operating companies and Southern Company Gas may be liable for some or all required cleanup costs for additional sites that may require environmental remediation. See Note 3 to the financial statements under ""Environmental Remediation"" for additional information.Global Climate IssuesIn 2019, the EPA published the final Affordable Clean Energy rule (ACE Rule), which would have required states to develop unit-specific CO2 emission rate standards for existing coal-fired units based on heat-rate efficiency improvements. On January 19, 2021, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit vacated and remanded the ACE Rule back to the EPA. On October 29, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court granted four petitions for writs of certiorari asking the court to review the District of Columbia Circuit's decision. The U.S. Supreme Court's review will focus on the extent of the EPA's authority to regulate GHG emissions from the power sector under Section 111(d) of the Clean Air Act.On February 19, 2021, the United States officially rejoined the Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement establishes a non-binding universal framework for addressing GHG emissions based on nationally determined emissions reduction contributions and sets in place a process for tracking progress towards the goals every five years. On April 22, 2021 President Biden announced a new target for the United States to achieve a 50% to 52% reduction in economy-wide GHG emissions from 2005 levels by 2030. The target was accepted by the United Nations as the United States' nationally determined emissions reduction contribution under the Paris Agreement.Additional GHG policies, including legislation, may emerge in the future requiring the United States to transition to a lower GHG emitting economy; however, associated impacts are currently unknown. The Southern Company system has transitioned from an electric generating mix of 70% coal and 15% natural gas in 2007 to a mix of 22% coal and 48% natural gas in 2021. This transition has been supported in part by the Southern Company system retiring over 5,600 MWs of coal-fired generating capacity since 2010 and converting over 3,400 MWs of generating capacity from coal to natural gas since 2015, as well as constructing and/or acquiring over 11,000 MWs of renewable resource capacity since 2010. See ""Environmental Laws and Regulations – Water Quality"" herein for information on plans to retire or convert to natural gas additional coal-fired generating capacity. In addition, Southern Company Gas has replaced over 6,000 miles of pipe material that was more prone to fugitive emissions (unprotected steel and cast-iron pipe), resulting in mitigation of more than 3.3 million metric tons of CO2 equivalents from its natural gas distribution system since 1998.II-44 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual ReportThe following table provides the Registrants' 2020 and preliminary 2021 GHG emissions based on equity share of facilities:2020Preliminary 2021(in million metric tons of CO2 equivalent)Southern Company(*)7582Alabama Power(*)2834Georgia Power2123Mississippi Power88Southern Power1211Southern Company Gas(*)11(*)Includes GHG emissions attributable to disposed assets through the date of the applicable disposition and to acquired assets beginning with the date of the applicable acquisition. See Note 15 to the financial statements for additional information.Southern Company system management has established an intermediate goal of a 50% reduction in GHG emissions from 2007 levels by 2030 and a long-term goal of net zero GHG emissions by 2050. Based on the preliminary 2021 emissions, the Southern Company system has achieved an estimated GHG emission reduction of 47% since 2007. In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in reduced electricity usage by customers, which led to a higher than expected decline in GHG emissions. In 2021, increased customer demand combined with increased utilization of the coal generating fleet due to higher natural gas prices resulted in an increase in GHG emissions from 2020 levels. Southern Company system management expects to achieve sustained GHG emissions reductions of at least 50% as early as 2025. Southern Company system management, working with applicable regulators, plans to transition its generating fleet in a manner responsible to customers, communities, employees, and other stakeholders. Achievement of these goals is dependent on many factors, including natural gas prices and the pace and extent of development and deployment of low- to no-GHG energy technologies and negative carbon concepts. Southern Company system management plans to continue to pursue a diverse portfolio including low-carbon and carbon-free resources and energy efficiency resources; continue to transition the Southern Company system's generating fleet and make the necessary related investments in transmission and distribution systems; continue its research and development with a particular focus on technologies that lower GHG emissions, including methods of removing carbon from the atmosphere; and constructively engage with policymakers, regulators, investors, customers, and other stakeholders to support outcomes leading to a net zero future.Regulatory MattersSee OVERVIEW – ""Recent Developments"" herein and Note 2 to the financial statements for a discussion of regulatory matters related to Alabama Power, Georgia Power, Mississippi Power, and Southern Company Gas, including items that could impact the applicable registrants' future earnings, cash flows, and/or financial condition.Construction ProgramsThe Subsidiary Registrants are engaged in continuous construction programs to accommodate existing and estimated future loads on their respective systems. The Southern Company system intends to continue its strategy of developing and constructing new electric generating facilities, expanding and improving the electric transmission and electric and natural gas distribution systems, and undertaking projects to comply with environmental laws and regulations.For the traditional electric operating companies, major generation construction projects are subject to state PSC approval in order to be included in retail rates. The largest construction project currently underway in the Southern Company system is Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Georgia Power – Nuclear Construction"" for additional information. Also see Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Alabama Power – Certificates of Convenience and Necessity"" for information regarding Alabama Power's construction of Plant Barry Unit 8.See Note 15 to the financial statements under ""Southern Power"" for information about costs relating to Southern Power's construction of renewable energy facilities.Southern Company Gas is engaged in various infrastructure improvement programs designed to update or expand the natural gas distribution systems of the natural gas distribution utilities to improve reliability and meet operational flexibility and growth. The natural gas distribution utilities recover their investment and a return associated with these infrastructure programs through their regulated rates. See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Southern Company Gas – Infrastructure Replacement Programs and Capital Projects"" for additional information on Southern Company Gas' construction program.II-45 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual ReportSee FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY – ""Cash Requirements"" herein for additional information regarding the Registrants' capital requirements for their construction programs, including estimated totals for each of the next five years.Southern Power's Power Sales AgreementsGeneralSouthern Power has PPAs with some of the traditional electric operating companies, other investor-owned utilities, IPPs, municipalities, and other load-serving entities, as well as commercial and industrial customers. The PPAs are expected to provide Southern Power with a stable source of revenue during their respective terms.Many of Southern Power's PPAs have provisions that require Southern Power or the counterparty to post collateral or an acceptable substitute guarantee if (i) S&P or Moody's downgrades the credit ratings of the respective company to an unacceptable credit rating, (ii) the counterparty is not rated, or (iii) the counterparty fails to maintain a minimum coverage ratio.Southern Power is working to maintain and expand its share of the wholesale markets. During 2021, Southern Power continued to be successful in remarketing up to 2,025 MWs of annual natural gas generation capacity to load-serving entities through several PPAs extending over the next 16 years. Market demand is being driven by load-serving entities replacing expired purchase contracts and/or retired generation, as well as planning for future growth.Natural GasSouthern Power's electricity sales from natural gas facilities are primarily through long-term PPAs that consist of two types of agreements. The first type, referred to as a unit or block sale, is a customer purchase from a dedicated generating unit where all or a portion of the generation from that unit is reserved for that customer. Southern Power typically has the ability to serve the unit or block sale customer from an alternate resource. The second type, referred to as requirements service, provides that Southern Power serve the customer's capacity and energy requirements from a combination of the customer's own generating units and from Southern Power resources not dedicated to serve unit or block sales. Southern Power has rights to purchase power provided by the requirements customers' resources when economically viable.As a general matter, substantially all of the PPAs provide that the purchasers are responsible for either procuring the fuel (tolling agreements) or reimbursing Southern Power for substantially all of the cost of fuel or purchased power relating to the energy delivered under such PPAs. To the extent a particular generating facility does not meet the operational requirements contemplated in the PPAs, Southern Power may be responsible for excess fuel costs. With respect to fuel transportation risk, most of Southern Power's PPAs provide that the counterparties are responsible for the availability of fuel transportation to the particular generating facility.Capacity charges that form part of the PPA payments are designed to recover fixed and variable operation and maintenance costs based on dollars-per-kilowatt year. In general, to reduce Southern Power's exposure to certain operation and maintenance costs, Southern Power has LTSAs. See Note 1 to the financial statements under ""Long-Term Service Agreements"" for additional information.Solar and WindSouthern Power's electricity sales from solar and wind generating facilities are also primarily through long-term PPAs; however, these solar and wind PPAs do not have a capacity charge and customers either purchase the energy output of a dedicated renewable facility through an energy charge or provide Southern Power a certain fixed price for the electricity sold to the grid. As a result, Southern Power's ability to recover fixed and variable operations and maintenance expenses is dependent upon the level of energy generated from these facilities, which can be impacted by weather conditions, equipment performance, transmission constraints, and other factors. Generally, under the renewable generation PPAs, the purchasing party retains the right to keep or resell the renewable energy credits.Income Tax MattersConsolidated Income TaxesThe impact of certain tax events at Southern Company and/or its other subsidiaries can, and does, affect each Registrant's ability to utilize certain tax credits. See ""Tax Credits"" and ACCOUNTING POLICIES – ""Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – Accounting for Income Taxes"" herein and Note 10 to the financial statements for additional information.II-46 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual ReportTax CreditsThe Tax Reform Legislation, as modified by the 2021 Consolidated Appropriations Act signed into law in December 2020, retained solar energy incentives as described in the following table:ITC PercentageDate Project Commenced Construction30%Prior to December 31, 201926%From 2020 through 202222%During 2023A permanent 10% ITC will remain for projects that commence construction on or after January 1, 2024 and any projects placed in service after December 31, 2025, regardless of when construction began.In addition, various tax legislation has retained or extended wind energy incentives as described in the following table:PTC PercentageYear Project Commenced Construction100%201680%201760%201840%201960%2020 or 20210%2022 and afterSouthern Company has received ITCs and PTCs in connection with investments in solar, wind, fuel cell facilities, and battery energy storage facilities (co-located with existing solar facilities) primarily at Southern Power and Georgia Power.Southern Power's ITCs relate to its investment in new solar facilities and battery energy storage facilities (co-located with existing solar facilities) that are acquired or constructed and its PTCs relate to the first 10 years of energy production from its wind facilities, which have had, and may continue to have, a material impact on Southern Power's cash flows and net income. At December 31, 2021, Southern Company and Southern Power had approximately $1.2 billion and $0.8 billion, respectively, of unutilized federal ITCs and PTCs, which are currently expected to be fully utilized by 2024, but could be further delayed. Since 2018, Southern Power has been utilizing tax equity partnerships for wind, solar, and battery energy storage projects, where the tax partner takes significantly all of the respective federal tax benefits. These tax equity partnerships are consolidated in Southern Company's and Southern Power's financial statements using the HLBV methodology to allocate partnership gains and losses. See Note 1 to the financial statements under ""General"" for additional information on the HLBV methodology and Note 1 to the financial statements under ""Income Taxes"" and Note 10 to the financial statements under ""Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities – Tax Credit Carryforwards"" and ""Effective Tax Rate"" for additional information regarding utilization and amortization of credits and the tax benefit related to associated basis differences.General Litigation and Other MattersThe Registrants are involved in various matters being litigated and/or regulatory and other matters that could affect future earnings, cash flows, and/or financial condition. The ultimate outcome of such pending or potential litigation against each Registrant and any subsidiaries or regulatory and other matters cannot be determined at this time; however, for current proceedings and/or matters not specifically reported herein or in Notes 2 and 3 to the financial statements, management does not anticipate that the ultimate liabilities, if any, arising from such current proceedings and/or matters would have a material effect on such Registrant's financial statements. See Notes 2 and 3 to the financial statements for a discussion of various contingencies, including matters being litigated, regulatory matters, and other matters which may affect future earnings potential.ACCOUNTING POLICIESApplication of Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesThe Registrants prepare their financial statements in accordance with GAAP. Significant accounting policies are described in the notes to the financial statements. In the application of these policies, certain estimates are made that may have a material impact on the results of operations and related disclosures of the applicable Registrants (as indicated in the section descriptions herein). Different assumptions and measurements could produce estimates that are significantly different from those recorded in the II-47 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual Reportfinancial statements. Senior management has reviewed and discussed the following critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of Southern Company's Board of Directors.Utility Regulation (Southern Company, Alabama Power, Georgia Power, Mississippi Power, and Southern Company Gas)The traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities are subject to retail regulation by their respective state PSCs or other applicable state regulatory agencies and wholesale regulation by the FERC. These regulatory agencies set the rates the traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities are permitted to charge customers based on allowable costs, including a reasonable ROE. As a result, the traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities apply accounting standards which require the financial statements to reflect the effects of rate regulation. Through the ratemaking process, the regulators may require the inclusion of costs or revenues in periods different than when they would be recognized by a non-regulated company. This treatment may result in the deferral of expenses and the recording of related regulatory assets based on anticipated future recovery through rates or the deferral of gains or creation of liabilities and the recording of related regulatory liabilities. The application of the accounting standards for rate regulated entities also impacts their financial statements as a result of the estimates of allowable costs used in the ratemaking process. These estimates may differ from those actually incurred by the traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities; therefore, the accounting estimates inherent in specific costs such as depreciation, AROs, and pension and other postretirement benefits have less of a direct impact on the results of operations and financial condition of the applicable Registrants than they would on a non-regulated company.Revenues related to regulated utility operations as a percentage of total operating revenues in 2021 for the applicable Registrants were as follows: 88% for Southern Company, 98% for Alabama Power, 96% for Georgia Power, 99.7% for Mississippi Power, and 84% for Southern Company Gas.As reflected in Note 2 to the financial statements, significant regulatory assets and liabilities have been recorded. Management reviews the ultimate recoverability of these regulatory assets and any requirement to refund these regulatory liabilities based on applicable regulatory guidelines and GAAP. However, adverse legislative, judicial, or regulatory actions could materially impact the amounts of such regulatory assets and liabilities and could adversely impact the financial statements of the applicable Registrants.Estimated Cost, Schedule, and Rate Recovery for the Construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4(Southern Company and Georgia Power)In 2016, the Georgia PSC approved the Vogtle Cost Settlement Agreement, which resolved certain prudency matters in connection with Georgia Power's fifteenth VCM report. In 2017, the Georgia PSC approved Georgia Power's seventeenth VCM report, which included a recommendation to continue construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, with Southern Nuclear serving as project manager and Bechtel serving as the primary construction contractor, as well as a modification of the Vogtle Cost Settlement Agreement. The Georgia PSC's related order stated that under the modified Vogtle Cost Settlement Agreement, (i) none of the $3.3 billion of costs incurred through December 31, 2015 should be disallowed as imprudent; (ii) the Contractor Settlement Agreement was reasonable and prudent and none of the $0.3 billion paid pursuant to the Contractor Settlement Agreement should be disallowed from rate base on the basis of imprudence; (iii) capital costs incurred up to $5.68 billion would be presumed to be reasonable and prudent with the burden of proof on any party challenging such costs; (iv) Georgia Power would have the burden of proof to show that any capital costs above $5.68 billion were prudent; (v) Georgia Power's total project capital cost forecast of $7.3 billion (net of $1.7 billion received under the Guarantee Settlement Agreement and approximately $188 million in related customer refunds) was found reasonable and did not represent a cost cap; and (vi) a prudence proceeding on cost recovery will occur subsequent to achieving fuel load for Unit 4. In its order, the Georgia PSC also stated if other conditions change and assumptions upon which Georgia Power's seventeenth VCM report are based do not materialize, the Georgia PSC reserved the right to reconsider the decision to continue construction.As of December 31, 2021, Georgia Power revised its total project capital cost forecast to $10.4 billion (net of $1.7 billion received under the Guarantee Settlement Agreement and approximately $188 million in related customer refunds). This forecast includes construction contingency of $150 million and is based on projected in-service dates at the end of the first quarter 2023 and the fourth quarter 2023 for Units 3 and 4, respectively. Since 2018, established construction contingency and additional costs totaling $2.2 billion have been assigned to the base capital cost forecast. Although Georgia Power believes these incremental costs are reasonable and necessary to complete the project and the Georgia PSC's order in the seventeenth VCM proceeding specifically states that the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 is not subject to a cost cap, Georgia Power will not seek rate recovery for the $0.7 billion increase to the base capital cost forecast included in the nineteenth VCM report and charged to income by Georgia Power in the second quarter 2018 and has not sought rate recovery for the construction contingency costs. After considering the significant level of uncertainty that exists regarding the future recoverability of these costs since the ultimate outcome of these II-48 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual Reportmatters is subject to the outcome of future assessments by management, as well as Georgia PSC decisions in these future regulatory proceedings, Georgia Power recorded total pre-tax charges to income of $1.1 billion ($0.8 billion after tax) in the second quarter 2018; $149 million ($111 million after tax) and $176 million ($131 million after tax) in the second quarter and the fourth quarter 2020, respectively; and $48 million ($36 million after tax), $460 million ($343 million after tax), $264 million ($197 million after tax), and $480 million ($358 million after tax) in the first quarter 2021, the second quarter 2021, the third quarter 2021, and the fourth quarter 2021, respectively.Georgia Power and the other Vogtle Owners do not agree on either the starting dollar amount for the determination of cost increases subject to the cost-sharing and tender provisions of the Global Amendments (as defined in Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Georgia Power – Nuclear Construction – Joint Owner Contracts"") or the extent to which COVID-19-related costs impact the calculation. Based on the definition in the Global Amendments, Georgia Power believes the starting dollar amount is $18.38 billion and the current project capital cost forecast has triggered the cost-sharing provisions. The other Vogtle Owners have asserted that the project cost increases have reached the cost-sharing thresholds and have triggered the tender provisions under the Global Amendments. Georgia Power recorded an additional pre-tax charge to income in the fourth quarter 2021 of approximately $440 million ($328 million after tax) associated with these cost-sharing and tender provisions, which is included in the total project capital cost forecast. Georgia Power may be required to record further pre-tax charges to income of up to approximately $460 million associated with these provisions based on the current project capital cost forecast. The incremental charges associated with these provisions will not be recovered from retail customers. On October 29, 2021, Georgia Power and the other Vogtle Owners entered into an agreement to clarify the process for the tender provisions of the Global Amendments to provide for a decision between 120 and 180 days after the tender option is triggered, which the other Vogtle Owners assert occurred on February 14, 2022. See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Georgia Power – Nuclear Construction – Joint Owner Contracts"" for additional information on the Global Amendments.As part of its ongoing processes, Southern Nuclear continues to evaluate cost and schedule forecasts on a regular basis to incorporate current information available, particularly in the areas of engineering support, commodity installation, system turnovers and related test results, and workforce statistics. Georgia Power estimates the productivity impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic have consumed approximately three to four months of schedule margin previously embedded in the site work plan for Unit 3 and Unit 4.As Unit 3 completes system turnover from construction and moves to testing and transition to operations, ongoing and potential future challenges include completion of construction remediation work, completion of work packages, including inspection records, and other documentation necessary to submit the remaining ITAACs and begin fuel load, and final component and pre-operational tests. As Unit 4 progresses through construction and continues to transition into testing, ongoing and potential future challenges include the pace and quality of electrical installation, availability of craft and supervisory resources, including the temporary diversion of such resources to support Unit 3 construction efforts, and the pace of work package closures and system turnovers. As construction, including subcontract work, continues on both Units 3 and 4, ongoing or future challenges include management of contractors and vendors; subcontractor performance; supervision of craft labor and related productivity, particularly in the installation of electrical, mechanical, and instrumentation and controls commodities, ability to attract and retain craft labor, and/or related cost escalation; and procurement and related installation. New challenges may arise, particularly as Units 3 and 4 move into initial testing and start-up, which may result in required engineering changes or remediation related to plant systems, structures, or components (some of which are based on new technology that only within the last few years began initial operation in the global nuclear industry at this scale). The ongoing and potential future challenges described above may change the projected schedule and estimated cost. In addition, the continuing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic could further disrupt or delay construction and testing activities at Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4.There have been technical and procedural challenges to the construction and licensing of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 at the federal and state level and additional challenges may arise. Processes are in place that are designed to ensure compliance with the requirements specified in the Westinghouse Design Control Document and the combined construction and operating licenses, including inspections by Southern Nuclear and the NRC that occur throughout construction. Findings resulting from such inspections could require additional remediation and/or further NRC oversight. In addition, certain license amendment requests have been filed and approved or are pending before the NRC. Various design and other licensing-based compliance matters, including the timely submittal by Southern Nuclear of the ITAAC documentation for each unit and the related reviews and approvals by the NRC necessary to support NRC authorization to load fuel, have arisen or may arise, which may result in additional license amendments or require other resolution. If any license amendment requests or other licensing-based compliance issues, including inspections and ITAACs, are not resolved in a timely manner, there may be delays in the project schedule that could result in increased costs.The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time. However, any extension of the in-service date beyond the first quarter 2023 for Unit 3 or the fourth quarter 2023 for Unit 4, including the current level of cost sharing described in Note II-49 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual Report2, is estimated to result in additional base capital costs for Georgia Power of up to $60 million per month for Unit 3 and $40 million per month for Unit 4, as well as the related AFUDC and any additional related construction, support resources, or testing costs. While Georgia Power is not precluded from seeking retail recovery of any future capital cost forecast increase other than the amounts related to the cost-sharing and tender provisions of the joint ownership agreements described above, management will ultimately determine whether or not to seek recovery. Any further changes to the capital cost forecast that are not expected to be recoverable through regulated rates will be required to be charged to income and such charges could be material.Given the significant complexity involved in estimating the future costs to complete construction and start-up of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 and the significant management judgment necessary to assess the related uncertainties surrounding future rate recovery of any projected cost increases, as well as the potential impact on results of operations and cash flows, Southern Company and Georgia Power consider these items to be critical accounting estimates. See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Georgia Power – Nuclear Construction"" for additional information.Accounting for Income Taxes (Southern Company, Mississippi Power, Southern Power, and Southern Company Gas)The consolidated income tax provision and deferred income tax assets and liabilities, as well as any unrecognized tax benefits and valuation allowances, require significant judgment and estimates. These estimates are supported by historical tax return data, reasonable projections of taxable income, the ability and intent to implement tax planning strategies if necessary, and interpretations of applicable tax laws and regulations across multiple taxing jurisdictions. The effective tax rate reflects the statutory tax rates and calculated apportionments for the various states in which the Southern Company system operates.Southern Company files a consolidated federal income tax return and the Registrants file various state income tax returns, some of which are combined or unitary. Under a joint consolidated income tax allocation agreement, each Southern Company subsidiary's current and deferred tax expense is computed on a stand-alone basis and each subsidiary is allocated an amount of tax similar to that which would be paid if it filed a separate income tax return. In accordance with IRS regulations, each company is jointly and severally liable for the federal tax liability. Certain deductions and credits can be limited or utilized at the consolidated or combined level resulting in tax credit and/or state NOL carryforwards that would not otherwise result on a stand-alone basis. Utilization of these carryforwards and the assessment of valuation allowances are based on significant judgment and extensive analysis of Southern Company's and its subsidiaries' current financial position and results of operations, including currently available information about future years, to estimate when future taxable income will be realized.Current and deferred state income tax liabilities and assets are estimated based on laws of multiple states that determine the income to be apportioned to their jurisdictions. States have various filing methodologies and utilize specific formulas to calculate the apportionment of taxable income. The calculation of deferred state taxes considers apportionment factors and filing methodologies that are expected to apply in future years. The apportionments and methodologies which are ultimately finalized in a manner inconsistent with expectations could have a material effect on the financial statements of the applicable Registrants.Given the significant judgment involved in estimating tax credit and/or state NOL carryforwards and multi-state apportionments for all subsidiaries, the applicable Registrants consider deferred income tax liabilities and assets to be critical accounting estimates.Asset Retirement Obligations (Southern Company, Alabama Power, Georgia Power, Mississippi Power, and Southern Company Gas)AROs are computed as the present value of the estimated costs for an asset's future retirement and are recorded in the period in which the liability is incurred. The estimated costs are capitalized as part of the related long-lived asset and depreciated over the asset's useful life. In the absence of quoted market prices, AROs are estimated using present value techniques in which estimates of future cash outlays associated with the asset retirements are discounted using a credit-adjusted risk-free rate. Estimates of the timing and amounts of future cash outlays are based on projections of when and how the assets will be retired and the cost of future removal activities.The ARO liabilities for the traditional electric operating companies primarily relate to facilities that are subject to the CCR Rule and the related state rules, principally ash ponds. In addition, Alabama Power and Georgia Power have retirement obligations related to the decommissioning of nuclear facilities (Alabama Power's Plant Farley and Georgia Power's ownership interests in Plant Hatch and Plant Vogtle Units 1 and 2). Other significant AROs include various landfill sites and asbestos removal for Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and Mississippi Power and gypsum cells and mine reclamation for Mississippi Power.The traditional electric operating companies and Southern Company Gas also have identified other retirement obligations, such as obligations related to certain electric transmission and distribution facilities, certain asbestos-containing material within long-term assets not subject to ongoing repair and maintenance activities, certain wireless communication towers, the disposal of polychlorinated biphenyls in certain transformers, leasehold improvements, equipment on customer property, and property II-50 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual Reportassociated with the Southern Company system's rail lines and natural gas pipelines. However, liabilities for the removal of these assets have not been recorded because the settlement timing for certain retirement obligations related to these assets is indeterminable and, therefore, the fair value of the retirement obligations cannot be reasonably estimated. A liability for these retirement obligations will be recognized when sufficient information becomes available to support a reasonable estimation of the ARO.The cost estimates for AROs related to the disposal of CCR are based on information using various assumptions related to closure and post-closure costs, timing of future cash outlays, inflation and discount rates, and the potential methods for complying with the CCR Rule and the related state rules. The traditional electric operating companies have periodically updated, and expect to continue periodically updating, their related cost estimates and ARO liabilities for each CCR unit as additional information related to these assumptions becomes available. Some of these updates have been, and future updates may be, material. See Note 6 to the financial statements for additional information, including increases to AROs related to ash ponds recorded during 2021 by certain Registrants.Given the significant judgment involved in estimating AROs, the applicable Registrants consider the liabilities for AROs to be critical accounting estimates.Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits (Southern Company, Alabama Power, Georgia Power, Mississippi Power, and Southern Company Gas)The applicable Registrants' calculations of pension and other postretirement benefits expense are dependent on a number of assumptions. These assumptions include discount rates, healthcare cost trend rates, expected long-term rate of return (LRR) on plan assets, mortality rates, expected salary and wage increases, and other factors. Components of pension and other postretirement benefits expense include interest and service cost on the pension and other postretirement benefit plans, expected return on plan assets, and amortization of certain unrecognized costs and obligations. Actual results that differ from the assumptions utilized are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, generally affect recognized expense and the recorded obligation in future periods. While the applicable Registrants believe the assumptions used are appropriate, differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions would affect their pension and other postretirement benefit costs and obligations.Key elements in determining the applicable Registrants' pension and other postretirement benefit expense are the LRR and the discount rate used to measure the benefit plan obligations and the periodic benefit plan expense for future periods. For purposes of determining the applicable Registrants' liabilities related to the pension and other postretirement benefit plans, Southern Company discounts the future related cash flows using a single-point discount rate for each plan developed from the weighted average of market-observed yields for high quality fixed income securities with maturities that correspond to expected benefit payments. The discount rate assumption impacts both the service cost and non-service costs components of net periodic benefit costs as well as the projected benefit obligations.The LRR on pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets is based on Southern Company's investment strategy, as described in Note 11 to the financial statements, historical experience, and expectations that consider external actuarial advice, and represents the average rate of earnings expected over the long term on the assets invested to provide for anticipated future benefit payments. Southern Company determines the amount of the expected return on plan assets component of non-service costs by applying the LRR of various asset classes to Southern Company's target asset allocation. The LRR only impacts the non-service costs component of net periodic benefit costs for the following year and is set annually at the beginning of the year.II-51 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual ReportThe following table illustrates the sensitivity to changes in the applicable Registrants' long-term assumptions with respect to the discount rate, salary increases, and the long-term rate of return on plan assets:Increase/(Decrease) in25 Basis Point Change in:Total Benefit Expense for 2022Projected Obligation for Pension Plan at December 31, 2021Projected Obligation forOther PostretirementBenefit Plans at December 31, 2021(in millions)Discount rate:Southern Company$44/$(43)$610/$(575)$53/$(51)Alabama Power$12/$(12)$149/$(140)$14/$(13)Georgia Power$12/$(12)$180/$(170)$18/$(17)Mississippi Power$2/$(2)$27/$(26)$2/$(2)Southern Company Gas$–/$–$40/$(38)$6/$(6)Salaries:Southern Company$26/$(24)$131/$(127)$–/$–Alabama Power$8/$(7)$37/$(36)$–/$–Georgia Power$7/$(7)$37/$(36)$–/$–Mississippi Power$1/$(1)$6/$(6)$–/$–Southern Company Gas$–/$–$2/$(2)$–/$–Long-term return on plan assets:Southern Company$41/$(41)N/AN/AAlabama Power$10/$(10)N/AN/AGeorgia Power$13/$(13)N/AN/AMississippi Power$2/$(2)N/AN/ASouthern Company Gas$3/$(3)N/AN/ASee Note 11 to the financial statements for additional information regarding pension and other postretirement benefits.Asset Impairment (Southern Company, Southern Power, and Southern Company Gas)Goodwill (Southern Company and Southern Company Gas)The acquisition method of accounting requires the assets acquired and liabilities assumed to be recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective estimated fair values. The applicable Registrants have recognized goodwill as of the date of their acquisitions, as a residual over the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis in the fourth quarter of the year as well as on an interim basis as events and changes in circumstances occur, including, but not limited to, a significant change in operating performance, the business climate, legal or regulatory factors, or a planned sale or disposition of a significant portion of the business. A reporting unit is the operating segment, or a business one level below the operating segment (a component), if discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by management. Components are aggregated if they have similar economic characteristics.As part of the impairment tests, the applicable Registrant may perform an initial qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit is less than its carrying amount before applying the quantitative goodwill impairment test. If the applicable Registrant elects to perform the qualitative assessment, it evaluates relevant events and circumstances, including but not limited to, macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, cost factors, financial performance, entity specific events, and events specific to each reporting unit. If the applicable Registrant determines that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, or it elects not to perform a qualitative assessment, it compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value to determine if the fair value is greater than its carrying value.Goodwill for Southern Company and Southern Company Gas was $5.3 billion and $5.0 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2021. For its 2021 annual impairment test, Southern Company Gas performed the quantitative assessment and confirmed that the II-52 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual Reportfair value of all of its reporting units with goodwill exceeded their carrying value. For its 2020 and 2019 annual impairment tests, Southern Company Gas performed the qualitative assessment and determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of all of its reporting units with goodwill exceeded their carrying amounts, and therefore no quantitative assessment was required. For its annual impairment tests for PowerSecure, Southern Company performed the quantitative assessment, which resulted in the fair value of goodwill at PowerSecure exceeding its carrying value in all years presented. However, Southern Company recorded goodwill impairment charges totaling $34 million in 2019 as a result of its decision to sell certain PowerSecure business units. See Note 15 to the financial statements under ""Southern Company"" for additional information. The COVID-19 pandemic and the related impacts on the worldwide economy have disrupted supply chains, reduced labor availability and productivity, and reduced economic activity in the United States. These effects have had a variety of adverse impacts on Southern Company and its subsidiaries, including PowerSecure. If these factors continue to negatively affect the operating results of PowerSecure and its businesses, a portion of the associated goodwill of $263 million may become impaired. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.The judgments made in determining the estimated fair value assigned to each class of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as well as asset lives, can significantly impact the applicable Registrant's results of operations. Fair values and useful lives are determined based on, among other factors, the expected future period of benefit of the asset, the various characteristics of the asset, and projected cash flows. As the determination of an asset's fair value and useful life involves management making certain estimates and because these estimates form the basis for the determination of whether or not an impairment charge should be recorded, the applicable Registrants consider these estimates to be critical accounting estimates.See Note 1 to the financial statements under ""Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets and Liabilities"" for additional information regarding the applicable Registrants' goodwill.Long-Lived Assets (Southern Company, Southern Power, and Southern Company Gas)The applicable Registrants assess their other long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset's carrying amount may not be recoverable. If an indicator exists, the asset is tested for recoverability by comparing the asset carrying value to the sum of the undiscounted expected future cash flows directly attributable to the asset's use and eventual disposition. If the estimate of undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset, the fair value of the asset is determined and a loss is recorded equal to the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the asset. In addition, when assets are identified as held for sale, an impairment loss is recognized to the extent the carrying value of the assets or asset group exceeds their fair value less cost to sell. A high degree of judgment is required in developing estimates related to these evaluations, which are based on projections of various factors, some of which have been quite volatile in recent years. Impairments of long-lived assets of the traditional electric utilities and natural gas distribution utilities are generally related to specific regulatory disallowances.Southern Power's investments in long-lived assets are primarily generation assets. Excluding the natural gas distribution utilities, Southern Company Gas' investments in long-lived assets are primarily natural gas transportation and storage facility assets, whether in service or under construction.For Southern Power, examples of impairment indicators could include significant changes in construction schedules, current period losses combined with a history of losses or a projection of continuing losses, a significant decrease in market prices, the inability to remarket generating capacity for an extended period, the unplanned termination of a customer contract, or the inability of a customer to perform under the terms of the contract. For Southern Company Gas, examples of impairment indicators could include, but are not limited to, significant changes in the U.S. natural gas storage market, construction schedules, current period losses combined with a history of losses or a projection of continuing losses, a significant decrease in market prices, the inability to renew or extend customer contracts or the inability of a customer to perform under the terms of the contract, attrition rates, or the inability to deploy a development project.As the determination of the expected future cash flows generated from an asset, an asset's fair value, and useful life involves management making certain estimates and because these estimates form the basis for the determination of whether or not an impairment charge should be recorded, the applicable Registrants consider these estimates to be critical accounting estimates.During 2021 and 2020, Southern Company recorded impairment charges totaling $7 million ($6 million after tax) and $206 million ($105 million after tax), respectively, related to its leveraged lease investments. During 2021, Southern Company Gas recorded total pre-tax charges of $84 million ($67 million after tax) related to its equity method investment in the PennEast Pipeline project. During 2019, Southern Company Gas recorded pre-tax impairment charges of $91 million ($69 million after-tax) related to a natural gas storage facility and approximately $24 million ($17 million after tax) related to the sale of Pivotal LNG. See Notes 7 and 9 to the financial statements under ""Southern Company Gas"" and ""Southern Company Leveraged Lease,"" respectively, and Note 15 to the financial statements for additional information on recent asset impairments.II-53 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual ReportRevenue Recognition (Southern Power)Southern Power's power sale transactions, which include PPAs, are classified in one of four general categories: leases, non-derivatives or normal sale derivatives, derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, and derivatives not designated as hedges. Southern Power's revenues are dependent upon significant judgments used to determine the appropriate transaction classification, which must be documented upon the inception of each contract. The two categories with the most judgment required for Southern Power are described further below.Lease TransactionsSouthern Power considers the terms of a sales contract to determine whether it should be accounted for as a lease. A contract is or contains a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of identified property, plant, or equipment for a period of time in exchange for consideration. If the contract meets the criteria for a lease, Southern Power performs further analysis to determine whether the lease is classified as operating, financing, or sales-type. Generally, Southern Power's power sales contracts that are determined to be leases are accounted for as operating leases and the capacity revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract and is included in Southern Power's operating revenues. Energy revenues and other contingent revenues are recognized in the period the energy is delivered or the service is rendered. For those contracts that are determined to be sales-type leases, capacity revenues are recognized by accounting for interest income on the net investment in the lease and are included in Southern Power's operating revenues. See Note 9 to the financial statements for additional information.Non-Derivative and Normal Sale Derivative TransactionsIf the power sales contract is not classified as a lease, Southern Power further considers whether the contract meets the definition of a derivative. If the contract does meet the definition of a derivative, Southern Power will assess whether it can be designated as a normal sale contract. The determination of whether a contract can be designated as a normal sale contract requires judgment, including whether the sale of electricity involves physical delivery in quantities within Southern Power's available generating capacity and that the purchaser will take quantities expected to be used or sold in the normal course of business.Contracts that do not meet the definition of a derivative or are designated as normal sales are accounted for as executory contracts. For contracts that have a capacity charge, the revenue is generally recognized in the period that it becomes billable. Revenues related to energy and ancillary services are recognized in the period the energy is delivered or the service is rendered. See Note 4 to the financial statements for additional information.Acquisition Accounting (Southern Power)Southern Power may acquire generation assets as part of its overall growth strategy. At the time of an acquisition, Southern Power will assess if these assets and activities meet the definition of a business. For acquisitions that meet the definition of a business, the purchase price, including any contingent consideration, is allocated based on the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed (including any intangible assets, primarily related to acquired PPAs). Assets acquired that do not meet the definition of a business are accounted for as an asset acquisition. The purchase price of each asset acquisition is allocated based on the relative fair value of assets acquired. Determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management judgment and Southern Power may engage independent valuation experts to assist in this process. Fair values are determined by using market participant assumptions, and typically include the timing and amounts of future cash flows, incurred construction costs, the nature of acquired contracts, discount rates, power market prices, and expected asset lives. Any due diligence or transition costs incurred by Southern Power for potential or successful acquisitions are expensed as incurred.See Note 13 to the financial statements for additional fair value information and Note 15 to the financial statements for additional information on recent acquisitions.Variable Interest Entities (Southern Power)Southern Power enters into partnerships with varying ownership structures. Upon entering into these arrangements, membership interests and other variable interests are evaluated to determine if the legal entity is a VIE. If the legal entity is a VIE, Southern Power will assess if it has both the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE, making it the primary beneficiary. Making this determination may require significant management judgment.If Southern Power is the primary beneficiary and is considered to have a controlling ownership, the assets, liabilities, and results of operations of the entity are consolidated. If Southern Power is not the primary beneficiary, the legal entity is generally accounted for under the equity method of accounting. Southern Power reconsiders its conclusions as to whether the legal entity is II-54 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual Reporta VIE and whether it is the primary beneficiary for events that impact the rights of variable interests, such as ownership changes in membership interests.Southern Power has controlling ownership in certain legal entities for which the contractual provisions represent profit-sharing arrangements because the allocations of cash distributions and tax benefits are not based on fixed ownership percentages. For these arrangements, the noncontrolling interest is accounted for under a balance sheet approach utilizing the HLBV method. The HLBV method calculates each partner's share of income based on the change in net equity the partner can legally claim in a HLBV at the end of the period compared to the beginning of the period.Contingent Obligations (All Registrants)The Registrants are subject to a number of federal and state laws and regulations, as well as other factors and conditions that subject them to environmental, litigation, and other risks. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL herein and Notes 2 and 3 to the financial statements for more information regarding certain of these contingencies. The Registrants periodically evaluate their exposure to such risks and record reserves for those matters where a non-tax-related loss is considered probable and reasonably estimable. The adequacy of reserves can be significantly affected by external events or conditions that can be unpredictable; thus, the ultimate outcome of such matters could materially affect the results of operations, cash flows, or financial condition of the Registrants.Recently Issued Accounting StandardsIn March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting (ASU 2020-04) providing temporary guidance to ease the potential burden in accounting for reference rate reform primarily resulting from the discontinuation of LIBOR, which began phasing out on December 31, 2021. The amendments in ASU 2020-04 are elective and apply to all entities that have contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions that reference LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued. The new guidance (i) simplifies accounting analyses under current GAAP for contract modifications; (ii) simplifies the assessment of hedge effectiveness and allows hedging relationships affected by reference rate reform to continue; and (iii) allows a one-time election to sell or transfer debt securities classified as held to maturity that reference a rate affected by reference rate reform. An entity may elect to apply the amendments prospectively from March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022 by accounting topic. The Registrants have elected to apply the amendments to modifications of debt arrangements that meet the scope of ASU 2020-04.The Registrants currently reference LIBOR for certain debt and hedging arrangements. In addition, certain provisions in PPAs at Southern Power include references to LIBOR. Contract language has been, or is expected to be, incorporated into each of these agreements to address the transition to an alternative rate for agreements that will be in place at the transition date. While no material impacts are expected from modifications to the arrangements and effective hedging relationships are expected to continue, the Registrants will continue to evaluate the provisions of ASU 2020–04 and the impacts of transitioning to an alternative rate, and the ultimate outcome of the transition cannot be determined at this time. See FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY – ""Overview"" and ""Financing Activities"" herein and Note 14 to the financial statements under ""Interest Rate Derivatives"" for additional information.FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITYOverviewThe financial condition of each Registrant remained stable at December 31, 2021. The Registrants' cash requirements primarily consist of funding ongoing operations, including unconsolidated subsidiaries, as well as common stock dividends, capital expenditures, and debt maturities. Southern Power's cash requirements also include distributions to noncontrolling interests. Capital expenditures and other investing activities for the traditional electric operating companies include investments to build new generation facilities to meet projected long-term demand requirements and to replace units being retired as part of the generation fleet transition, to maintain existing generation facilities, to comply with environmental regulations including adding environmental modifications to certain existing generating units and closures of ash ponds, to expand and improve transmission and distribution facilities, and for restoration following major storms. Southern Power's capital expenditures and other investing activities may include acquisitions or new construction associated with its overall growth strategy and to maintain its existing generation fleet's performance. Southern Company Gas' capital expenditures and other investing activities include investments to meet projected long-term demand requirements, to maintain existing natural gas distribution systems as well as to update and expand these systems, and to comply with environmental regulations. See ""Cash Requirements"" herein for additional information.Operating cash flows provide a substantial portion of the Registrants' cash needs. During 2021, Southern Power utilized tax credits, which provided $288 million in operating cash flows. For the three-year period from 2022 through 2024, each Registrant's II-55 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual Reportprojected stock dividends, capital expenditures, and debt maturities, as well as distributions to noncontrolling interests for Southern Power, are expected to exceed its operating cash flows. Southern Company plans to finance future cash needs in excess of its operating cash flows through one or more of the following: accessing borrowings from financial institutions, issuing debt and hybrid securities in the capital markets, and/or through its stock plans. Each Subsidiary Registrant plans to finance its future cash needs in excess of its operating cash flows primarily through external securities issuances, borrowings from financial institutions, and equity contributions from Southern Company. In addition, Southern Power plans to utilize tax equity partnership contributions. The Registrants plan to use commercial paper to manage seasonal variations in operating cash flows and for other working capital needs and continue to monitor their access to short-term and long-term capital markets as well as their bank credit arrangements to meet future capital and liquidity needs. See ""Sources of Capital"" and ""Financing Activities"" herein for additional information.To facilitate an orderly transition from LIBOR to alternative benchmark rate(s), the Registrants have established an initiative to assess and mitigate risks associated with the discontinuation of LIBOR. As part of this initiative, several alternative benchmark rates have been, and continue to be, evaluated and implemented. Substantially all of the Registrants' credit facilities allow for LIBOR to be phased out and replaced with the Secured Overnight Financing Rate and interest rate derivatives address the LIBOR transition through the adoption of the ISDA 2020 IBOR Fallbacks Protocol and subsequent amendments. None of the Registrants expects the transition from LIBOR to have a material impact.The Registrants' investments in their qualified pension plans and Alabama Power's and Georgia Power's investments in their nuclear decommissioning trust funds increased in value at December 31, 2021 as compared to December 31, 2020. No contributions to the qualified pension plan were made during 2021 and no mandatory contributions to the qualified pension plans are anticipated during 2022. See Notes 6 and 11 to the financial statements under ""Nuclear Decommissioning"" and ""Pension Plans,"" respectively, for additional information.At the end of 2021, the market price of Southern Company's common stock was $68.58 per share (based on the closing price as reported on the NYSE) and the book value was $26.30 per share, representing a market-to-book value ratio of 261%, compared to $61.43, $26.48, and 232%, respectively, at the end of 2020.Cash RequirementsCapital ExpendituresTotal estimated capital expenditures, including LTSA and nuclear fuel commitments, for the Registrants through 2026 based on their current construction programs are as follows:20222023202420252026(in billions)Southern Company(a)(b)(c)$8.7 $8.6 $7.5 $7.2 $7.1 Alabama Power(a)1.9 1.8 1.7 1.7 1.7 Georgia Power(b)4.4 4.5 3.5 3.5 3.4 Mississippi Power0.3 0.3 0.2 0.2 0.2 Southern Power(c)0.1 0.2 0.1 0.1 0.1 Southern Company Gas1.7 1.7 1.8 1.7 1.7 (a)Includes expenditures of approximately $0.3 billion and $0.1 billion for the construction of Plant Barry Unit 8 in 2022 and 2023, respectively. See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Alabama Power"" for additional information.(b)Includes expenditures of approximately $1.3 billion and $0.9 billion for the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 in 2022 and 2023, respectively.(c)Excludes approximately $0.3 billion in 2022, $0.5 billion in 2023, and $0.8 billion per year for 2024 through 2026 for Southern Power's planned acquisitions and placeholder growth, which may vary materially due to market opportunities and Southern Power's ability to execute its growth strategy.These capital expenditures include estimates to comply with environmental laws and regulations, but do not include any potential compliance costs associated with any future regulation of CO2 emissions from fossil fuel-fired electric generating units. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – ""Environmental Matters"" herein for additional information. At December 31, 2021, significant purchase commitments were outstanding in connection with the Registrants' construction programs.II-56 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual ReportThe traditional electric operating companies also anticipate expenditures associated with closure and monitoring of ash ponds and landfills in accordance with the CCR Rule and the related state rules, which are reflected in the applicable Registrants' ARO liabilities. The cost estimates for Alabama Power and Mississippi Power are based on closure-in-place for all ash ponds. The cost estimates for Georgia Power are based on a combination of closure-in-place for some ash ponds and closure by removal for others. These anticipated costs are likely to change, and could change materially, as assumptions and details pertaining to closure are refined and compliance activities continue. Current estimates of these costs through 2026 are provided in the table below. Material expenditures in future years for ARO settlements will also be required for ash ponds, nuclear decommissioning (for Alabama Power and Georgia Power), and other liabilities reflected in the applicable Registrants' AROs, as discussed further in Note 6 to the financial statements. Also see FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – ""Environmental Matters – Environmental Laws and Regulations – Coal Combustion Residuals"" herein.20222023202420252026(in millions)Southern Company$687 $688 $767 $907 $888 Alabama Power320 330 346 364 299 Georgia Power317 307 368 489 555 Mississippi Power16 20 23 30 16 The construction programs are subject to periodic review and revision, and actual construction costs may vary from these estimates because of numerous factors. These factors include: changes in business conditions; changes in load projections; changes in environmental laws and regulations; the outcome of any legal challenges to environmental rules; changes in electric generating plants, including unit retirements and replacements and adding or changing fuel sources at existing electric generating units, to meet regulatory requirements; changes in FERC rules and regulations; state regulatory agency approvals; changes in the expected environmental compliance program; changes in legislation and/or regulation; the cost, availability, and efficiency of construction labor, equipment, and materials; project scope and design changes; abnormal weather; delays in construction due to judicial or regulatory action; storm impacts; and the cost of capital. The continued impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic could also impair the ability to develop, construct, and operate facilities, as discussed further in Item 1A herein. In addition, there can be no assurance that costs related to capital expenditures and AROs will be fully recovered. Additionally, expenditures associated with Southern Power's planned acquisitions may vary due to market opportunities and the execution of its growth strategy. See Note 15 to the financial statements under ""Southern Power"" for additional information regarding Southern Power's plant acquisitions and construction projects.The construction program of Georgia Power includes Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, which includes components based on new technology that only within the last few years began initial operation in the global nuclear industry at this scale and which may be subject to additional revised cost estimates during construction. See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Georgia Power – Nuclear Construction"" for information regarding Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 and additional factors that may impact construction expenditures.See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – ""Construction Programs"" herein for additional information.Other Significant Cash RequirementsLong-term debt maturities and the interest payable on long-term debt each represent a significant cash requirement for the Registrants. See Note 8 to the financial statements for information regarding the Registrants' long-term debt at December 31, 2021, the weighted average interest rate applicable to each long-term debt category, and a schedule of long-term debt maturities over the next five years. The Registrants plan to continue, when economically feasible, to retire higher-cost securities and replace these obligations with lower-cost capital if market conditions permit.II-57 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual ReportFuel and purchased power costs represent a significant component of funding ongoing operations for the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power. See Note 3 to the financial statements under ""Commitments"" for information on Southern Company Gas' commitments for pipeline charges, storage capacity, and gas supply. Total estimated costs for fuel and purchased power commitments at December 31, 2021 for the applicable Registrants are provided in the table below. Fuel costs include purchases of coal (for the traditional electric operating companies) and natural gas (for the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power), as well as the related transportation and storage. In most cases, these contracts contain provisions for price escalation, minimum purchase levels, and other financial commitments. Natural gas purchase commitments are based on various indices at the time of delivery; the amounts reflected below have been estimated based on the NYMEX future prices at December 31, 2021. As discussed under ""Capital Expenditures"" herein, estimated expenditures for nuclear fuel are included in the applicable Registrants' construction programs for the years 2022 through 2026. Nuclear fuel commitments at December 31, 2021 that extend beyond 2026 are included in the table below. Purchased power costs represent estimated minimum obligations for various PPAs for the purchase of capacity and energy, except for those accounted for as leases, which are discussed in Note 9 to the financial statements.20222023202420252026Thereafter(in millions)Southern Company(*)$3,740 $1,983 $1,302 $969 $753 $5,803 Alabama Power1,170 581 446 358 203 1,182 Georgia Power(*)1,405 795 440 348 329 4,118 Mississippi Power539 235 168 109 98 491 Southern Power626 372 248 154 123 12 (*)Excludes capacity payments related to Plant Vogtle Units 1 and 2, which are discussed in Note 3 to the financial statements under ""Commitments.""Georgia Power's 2022 IRP filing included a request for six PPAs, which are expected to be accounted for as leases, that are contingent upon approval by the Georgia PSC. Five of the six PPAs are with Southern Power and are also contingent upon approval by the FERC. The expected capacity payments associated with the PPAs total $6 million in 2024, $79 million in 2025, $86 million in 2026, and $908 million thereafter, of which $5 million in 2024, $68 million in 2025, $75 million in 2026, and $748 million thereafter relate to the affiliate PPAs with Southern Power. See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Georgia Power – Integrated Resource Plan"" for additional information.The traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power have entered into LTSAs for the purpose of securing maintenance support for certain of their generating facilities.

Equity capital can be provided from any combination of Southern Company's stock plans, private placements, or public offerings. Southern Company does not expect to issue any equity in the capital markets through 2026 but may issue equity through its stock plans during this time. See Note 8 to the financial statements under ""Equity Units"" for information on stock purchase contracts associated with Southern Company's equity units.The Subsidiary Registrants plan to obtain the funds to meet their future capital needs from sources similar to those they used in the past, which were primarily from operating cash flows, external securities issuances, borrowings from financial institutions, and equity contributions from Southern Company. In addition, Southern Power plans to utilize tax equity partnership contributions (as discussed further herein).The amount, type, and timing of any financings in 2022, as well as in subsequent years, will be contingent on investment opportunities and the Registrants' capital requirements and will depend upon prevailing market conditions, regulatory approvals (for certain of the Subsidiary Registrants), and other factors. See ""Cash Requirements"" herein for additional information.Southern Power utilizes tax equity partnerships as one of its financing sources, where the tax partner takes significantly all of the federal tax benefits. These tax equity partnerships are consolidated in Southern Power's financial statements and are accounted for using HLBV methodology to allocate partnership gains and losses. During 2021, Southern Power obtained tax equity funding for the Deuel Harvest wind facility, the Garland and Tranquillity battery energy storage facilities, and existing tax equity partnerships totaling $299 million. See Notes 1 and 15 to the financial statements under ""General"" and ""Southern Power,"" respectively, for additional information.The issuance of securities by the traditional electric operating companies and Nicor Gas is generally subject to the approval of the applicable state PSC or other applicable state regulatory agency. The issuance of all securities by Mississippi Power and short-term securities by Georgia Power is generally subject to regulatory approval by the FERC. Additionally, with respect to the public offering of securities, Southern Company, the traditional electric operating companies, and Southern Power (excluding its subsidiaries), Southern Company Gas Capital, and Southern Company Gas (excluding its other subsidiaries) file registration statements with the SEC under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (1933 Act). The amounts of securities authorized by the appropriate regulatory authorities, as well as the securities registered under the 1933 Act, are closely monitored and appropriate filings are made to ensure flexibility in the capital markets.The Registrants generally obtain financing separately without credit support from any affiliate. See Note 8 to the financial statements under ""Bank Credit Arrangements"" for additional information. The Southern Company system does not maintain a centralized cash or money pool. Therefore, funds of each company are not commingled with funds of any other company in the Southern Company system, except in the case of Southern Company Gas, as described below.The traditional electric operating companies and SEGCO may utilize a Southern Company subsidiary organized to issue and sell commercial paper at their request and for their benefit. Proceeds from such issuances for the benefit of an individual company are loaned directly to that company. The obligations of each traditional electric operating company and SEGCO under these arrangements are several and there is no cross-affiliate credit support. Alabama Power also maintains its own separate commercial paper program.Southern Company Gas Capital obtains external financing for Southern Company Gas and its subsidiaries, other than Nicor Gas, which obtains financing separately without credit support from any affiliates. Southern Company Gas maintains commercial paper programs at Southern Company Gas Capital and Nicor Gas. Nicor Gas' commercial paper program supports its working capital needs as Nicor Gas is not permitted to make money pool loans to affiliates. All of the other Southern Company Gas subsidiaries benefit from Southern Company Gas Capital's commercial paper program.By regulation, Nicor Gas is restricted, to the extent of its retained earnings balance, in the amount it can dividend or loan to affiliates and is not permitted to make money pool loans to affiliates. At December 31, 2021, the amount of subsidiary retained earnings restricted to dividend totaled $1.3 billion. This restriction did not impact Southern Company Gas' ability to meet its cash obligations, nor does management expect such restriction to materially impact Southern Company Gas' ability to meet its currently anticipated cash obligations.II-59 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual ReportCertain Registrants' current liabilities frequently exceed their current assets because of long-term debt maturities and the periodic use of short-term debt as a funding source, as well as significant seasonal fluctuations in cash needs. The Registrants generally plan to refinance long-term debt as it matures. See Note 8 to the financial statements for additional information. Also see ""Financing Activities"" herein for information on financing activities that occurred subsequent to December 31, 2021. The following table shows the amount by which current liabilities exceeded current assets at December 31, 2021 for the applicable Registrants:At December 31, 2021SouthernCompanyGeorgiaPowerMississippi PowerSouthern PowerSouthern Company Gas(in millions)Current liabilities in excess of current assets$1,956 $1,544 $57 $748 $471 The Registrants believe the need for working capital can be adequately met by utilizing operating cash flows, as well as commercial paper, lines of credit, and short-term bank notes, as market conditions permit. In addition, under certain circumstances, the Subsidiary Registrants may utilize equity contributions and/or loans from Southern Company.Bank Credit ArrangementsAt December 31, 2021, the Registrants' unused committed credit arrangements with banks were as follows:At December 31, 2021SouthernCompanyparentAlabama PowerGeorgiaPowerMississippi PowerSouthern Power(a)Southern Company Gas(b)SEGCOSouthernCompany(in millions)Unused committed credit$1,998 $1,250 $1,726 $275 $568 $1,747 $30 $7,594 (a)At December 31, 2021, Southern Power also had two continuing letters of credit facilities for standby letters of credit, of which $12 million was unused. Southern Power's subsidiaries are not parties to its bank credit arrangements or letter of credit facilities.(b)Includes $1.047 billion and $700 million at Southern Company Gas Capital and Nicor Gas, respectively.Subject to applicable market conditions, the Registrants, Nicor Gas, and SEGCO expect to renew or replace their bank credit arrangements as needed, prior to expiration. In connection therewith, the Registrants, Nicor Gas, and SEGCO may extend the maturity dates and/or increase or decrease the lending commitments thereunder. A portion of the unused credit with banks is allocated to provide liquidity support to the revenue bonds of the traditional electric operating companies and the commercial paper programs of the Registrants, Nicor Gas, and SEGCO. The amount of variable rate revenue bonds of the traditional electric operating companies outstanding requiring liquidity support at December 31, 2021 was approximately $1.5 billion (comprised of approximately $789 million at Alabama Power, $672 million at Georgia Power, and $34 million at Mississippi Power). In addition, at December 31, 2021, Georgia Power had approximately $157 million of fixed rate revenue bonds outstanding that are required to be remarketed within the next 12 months.

These contracts are primarily for physical electricity and natural gas purchases and sales, fuel purchases, fuel transportation and storage, energy price risk management, transmission, interest rate management, and, for Georgia Power, construction of new generation at Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4.II-68 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual ReportThe maximum potential collateral requirements under these contracts at December 31, 2021 were as follows:Credit RatingsSouthern Company(*)Alabama PowerGeorgia PowerMississippi PowerSouthernPower(*)Southern Company Gas(in millions)At BBB and/or Baa2$41 $1 $— $— $40 $— At BBB- and/or Baa3419 2 61 1 357 — At BB+ and/or Ba1 or below1,934 407 939 307 1,186 9 (*)Southern Power has PPAs that could require collateral, but not accelerated payment, in the event of a downgrade of Southern Power's credit. The PPAs require credit assurances without stating a specific credit rating. The amount of collateral required would depend upon actual losses resulting from a credit downgrade. Southern Power had $105 million of cash collateral posted related to PPA requirements at December 31, 2021.The amounts in the previous table for the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power include certain agreements that could require collateral if either Alabama Power or Georgia Power has a credit rating change to below investment grade. Generally, collateral may be provided by a Southern Company guaranty, letter of credit, or cash. Additionally, a credit rating downgrade could impact the ability of the Registrants to access capital markets and would be likely to impact the cost at which they do so.Mississippi Power and its largest retail customer, Chevron, have agreements under which Mississippi Power provides retail service to the Chevron refinery in Pascagoula, Mississippi through at least 2038. The agreements grant Chevron a security interest in the co-generation assets owned by Mississippi Power located at the refinery that is exercisable upon the occurrence of (i) certain bankruptcy events or (ii) other events of default coupled with specific reductions in steam output at the facility and a downgrade of Mississippi Power's credit rating to below investment grade by two of the three rating agencies.On October 27, 2021, S&P downgraded the Southern Company issuer credit rating to BBB+ from A-. Due to S&P's consolidated rating methodology, the downgrade of Southern Company's issuer credit rating resulted in the downgrade of the senior unsecured long-term debt rating of Alabama Power and the long-term issuer rating of Nicor Gas to A- from A, the senior unsecured long-term debt ratings of Atlanta Gas Light, Georgia Power, Mississippi Power, and Southern Company Gas Capital to BBB+ from A-, and the senior unsecured long-term debt ratings of Southern Company and Southern Power to BBB from BBB+. S&P revised its credit rating outlook for Southern Company and its subsidiaries to stable from negative.Market Price RiskAs a result of the sale of Sequent on July 1, 2021, Southern Company Gas' market risk exposure decreased significantly. The other Registrants had no material change in market risk exposure for the year ended December 31, 2021 when compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. See Note 14 to the financial statements for an in-depth discussion of the Registrants' derivatives, as well as Note 1 to the financial statements under ""Financial Instruments"" for additional information. See Note 15 to the financial statements under ""Southern Company Gas"" for information regarding the sale of Sequent.Due to cost-based rate regulation and other various cost recovery mechanisms, the traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities that sell natural gas directly to end-use customers continue to have limited exposure to market volatility in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, commodity fuel prices, and prices of electricity. The traditional electric operating companies and certain of the natural gas distribution utilities manage fuel-hedging programs implemented per the guidelines of their respective state PSCs or other applicable state regulatory agencies to hedge the impact of market fluctuations in natural gas prices for customers. Mississippi Power also manages wholesale fuel-hedging programs under agreements with its wholesale customers. Because energy from Southern Power's facilities is primarily sold under long-term PPAs with tolling agreements and provisions shifting substantially all of the responsibility for fuel cost to the counterparties, Southern Power's exposure to market volatility in commodity fuel prices and prices of electricity is generally limited. However, Southern Power has been and may continue to be exposed to market volatility in energy-related commodity prices as a result of uncontracted generating capacity. To mitigate residual risks relative to movements in electricity prices, the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power may enter into physical fixed-price contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity through the wholesale electricity market and, to a lesser extent, financial hedge contracts for natural gas purchases; however, a significant portion of contracts are priced at market.Certain of Southern Company Gas' non-regulated operations (primarily Sequent until its sale on July 1, 2021) routinely utilize various types of derivative instruments to economically hedge certain commodity price and weather risks inherent in the natural gas industry. These instruments include a variety of exchange-traded and OTC energy contracts, such as forward contracts, futures contracts, options contracts, and swap agreements. Southern Company Gas' gas marketing services business also actively II-69 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual Reportmanages storage positions through a variety of hedging transactions for the purpose of managing exposures arising from changing natural gas prices. These hedging instruments are used to substantially protect economic margins (as spreads between wholesale and retail natural gas prices widen between periods) and thereby minimize exposure to declining earnings. Some of these economic hedge activities may not qualify, or may not be designated, for hedge accounting treatment.The following table provides information related to variable interest rate exposure on long-term debt (including amounts due within one year) at December 31, 2021 for the applicable Registrants:At December 31, 2021Southern Company(*)AlabamaPowerGeorgiaPowerMississippiPowerSouthern CompanyGas(in millions, except percentages)Long-term variable interest rate exposure$4,464 $834 $797 $234 $500 Weighted average interest rate on long-term variable interest rate exposure0.84 %0.21 %0.21 %0.32 %0.49 %Impact on annualized interest expense of 100 basis point change in interest rates$45 $8 $8 $2 $5 (*)Includes $2.0 billion of long-term variable interest rate exposure at the Southern Company parent entity.The Registrants may enter into interest rate derivatives designated as hedges, which are intended to mitigate interest rate volatility related to forecasted debt financings and existing fixed and floating rate obligations. See Note 14 to the financial statements under ""Interest Rate Derivatives"" for additional information.Southern Company and Southern Power had foreign currency denominated debt at December 31, 2021 and have each mitigated exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk through the use of foreign currency swaps. See Note 14 to the financial statements under ""Foreign Currency Derivatives"" for additional information.Changes in fair value of energy-related derivative contracts for Southern Company and Southern Company Gas for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 are provided in the table below. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, substantially all of the traditional electric operating companies' and certain of the natural gas distribution utilities' energy-related derivative contracts were designated as regulatory hedges and were related to the applicable company's fuel-hedging program.Southern Company(a)Southern Company Gas(a)(in millions)Contracts outstanding at December 31, 2019, assets (liabilities), net$(21)$72 Contracts realized or settled(14)(98)Current period changes(b)142 127 Contracts outstanding at December 31, 2020, assets (liabilities), net$107 $101 Contracts realized or settled(252)(85)Current period changes(b)243 (84)Sale of Sequent76 76 Contracts outstanding at December 31, 2021, assets (liabilities), net$174 $8 (a)Excludes cash collateral held on deposit in broker margin accounts of $3 million, $28 million, and $99 million at December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively, and immaterial premium and intrinsic value associated with weather derivatives for all periods presented.(b)The changes in fair value of energy-related derivative contracts are substantially attributable to both the volume and the price of natural gas. Current period changes also include the changes in fair value of new contracts entered into during the period, if any.II-70 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual ReportThe net hedge volumes of energy-related derivative contracts for natural gas purchased (sold) at December 31, 2021 and 2020 for Southern Company and Southern Company Gas were as follows:Southern CompanySouthern Company GasmmBtu Volume (in millions)At December 31, 2021:Commodity – Natural gas swaps57 — Commodity – Natural gas options253 68 Total hedge volume310 68 At December 31, 2020:Commodity – Natural gas swaps262 — Commodity – Natural gas options574 523 Total hedge volume836 523 Southern Company Gas' derivative contracts are comprised of both long and short natural gas positions. A long position is a contract to purchase natural gas, and a short position is a contract to sell natural gas. The volumes presented above for Southern Company Gas represent the net of long natural gas positions of 74 million mmBtu and short natural gas positions of 6 million mmBtu at December 31, 2021 and the net of long natural gas positions of 4.42 billion mmBtu and short natural gas positions of 3.90 billion mmBtu at December 31, 2020.For the Southern Company system, the weighted average swap contract cost per mmBtu was approximately $0.74 per mmBtu below market prices at December 31, 2021 and was equal to market prices at December 31, 2020. The change in option fair value is primarily attributable to the volatility of the market and the underlying change in the natural gas price. Substantially all of the traditional electric operating companies' natural gas hedge gains and losses are recovered through their respective fuel cost recovery clauses.The Registrants use over-the-counter contracts that are not exchange traded but are fair valued using prices which are market observable, and thus fall into Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. In addition, Southern Company Gas uses exchange-traded market-observable contracts, which are categorized as Level 1. See Note 13 to the financial statements for further discussion of fair value measurements. The maturities of the energy-related derivative contracts for Southern Company and Southern Company Gas at December 31, 2021 were as follows:Fair Value Measurements of Contracts atDecember 31, 2021TotalFair ValueMaturity20222023 – 20242025 – 2026(in millions)Southern CompanyLevel 1(a)$15 $14 $1 $— Level 2(b)159 93 65 1 Southern Company total(c)$174 $107 $66 $1 Southern Company GasLevel 1(a)$15 $14 $1 $— Level 2(b)(7)(7)— — Southern Company Gas total(c)$8 $7 $1 $— (a)Valued using NYMEX futures prices.(b)Level 2 amounts for Southern Company Gas are valued using basis transactions that represent the cost to transport natural gas from a NYMEX delivery point to the contract delivery point.

The Registrants only enter into agreements and material transactions with counterparties that have investment grade credit ratings by Moody's and S&P, or with counterparties who have posted collateral to cover potential credit exposure. Therefore, the Registrants do not anticipate market risk exposure from nonperformance by the counterparties. For additional information, see Note 1 to the financial statements under ""Financial Instruments"" and Note 14 to the financial statements.Credit RiskSouthern Company (except as discussed herein), the traditional electric operating companies, and Southern Power are not exposed to any concentrations of credit risk. Southern Company Gas' exposure to concentrations of credit risk is discussed herein.Southern Company GasGas Distribution OperationsConcentration of credit risk occurs at Atlanta Gas Light for amounts billed for services and other costs to its customers, which consist of the 16 Marketers in Georgia. The credit risk exposure to the Marketers varies seasonally, with the lowest exposure in the non-peak summer months and the highest exposure in the peak winter months. Marketers are responsible for the retail sale of natural gas to end-use customers in Georgia. The provisions of Atlanta Gas Light's tariff allow Atlanta Gas Light to obtain credit security support in an amount equal to a minimum of two times a Marketer's highest month's estimated bill from Atlanta Gas Light. For 2021, the four largest Marketers based on customer count, which includes SouthStar, accounted for 15% of Southern Company Gas' operating revenues and 17% of operating revenues for Southern Company Gas' gas distribution operations segment.Several factors are designed to mitigate Southern Company Gas' risks from the increased concentration of credit that has resulted from deregulation. In addition to the security support described above, Atlanta Gas Light bills intrastate delivery service to Marketers in advance rather than in arrears. Atlanta Gas Light accepts credit support in the form of cash deposits, letters of credit/surety bonds from acceptable issuers, and corporate guarantees from investment-grade entities. Southern Company Gas reviews the adequacy of credit support coverage, credit rating profiles of credit support providers, and payment status of each Marketer. Southern Company Gas believes that adequate policies and procedures are in place to properly quantify, manage, and report on Atlanta Gas Light's credit risk exposure to Marketers.Atlanta Gas Light also faces potential credit risk in connection with assignments of interstate pipeline transportation and storage capacity to Marketers. Although Atlanta Gas Light assigns this capacity to Marketers, in the event that a Marketer fails to pay the interstate pipelines for the capacity, the interstate pipelines would likely seek repayment from Atlanta Gas Light.Wholesale Gas ServicesFollowing the sale of Sequent on July 1, 2021, Southern Company Gas no longer has exposure to counterparty credit risk for wholesale gas services. See Note 15 to the financial statements under ""Southern Company Gas"" for information on the sale of Sequent.Gas Marketing ServicesSouthern Company Gas obtains credit scores for its firm residential and small commercial customers using a national credit reporting agency, enrolling only those customers that meet or exceed Southern Company Gas' credit threshold. Southern Company Gas considers potential interruptible and large commercial customers based on reviews of publicly available financial statements and commercially available credit reports. Prior to entering into a physical transaction, Southern Company Gas also assigns physical wholesale counterparties an internal credit rating and credit limit based on the counterparties' Moody's, S&P, and Fitch ratings, commercially available credit reports, and audited financial statements.II-72 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements",2023-12-30 19:50:11.626913

Also see Notes 13 and 14 to the financial statements in Item 8 herein.II-2 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISOVERVIEWBusiness ActivitiesSouthern Company is a holding company that owns all of the common stock of three traditional electric operating companies, Southern Power, and Southern Company Gas and owns other direct and indirect subsidiaries. The primary businesses of the Southern Company system are electricity sales by the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power and the distribution of natural gas by Southern Company Gas. Southern Company's reportable segments are the sale of electricity by the traditional electric operating companies, the sale of electricity in the competitive wholesale market by Southern Power, and the sale of natural gas and other complementary products and services by Southern Company Gas. See Note 16 to the financial statements for additional information.•The traditional electric operating companies – Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and Mississippi Power – are vertically integrated utilities providing electric service to retail customers in three Southeastern states in addition to wholesale customers in the Southeast.•Southern Power develops, constructs, acquires, owns, and manages power generation assets, including renewable energy projects, and sells electricity at market-based rates in the wholesale market. Southern Power continually seeks opportunities to execute its strategy to create value through various transactions including acquisitions, dispositions, and sales of partnership interests, development and construction of new generating facilities, and entry into PPAs primarily with investor-owned utilities, IPPs, municipalities, electric cooperatives, and other load-serving entities, as well as commercial and industrial customers. In general, Southern Power commits to the construction or acquisition of new generating capacity only after entering into or assuming long-term PPAs for the new facilities.•Southern Company Gas is an energy services holding company whose primary business is the distribution of natural gas. Southern Company Gas owns natural gas distribution utilities in four states – Illinois, Georgia, Virginia, and Tennessee – and is also involved in several other complementary businesses. Southern Company Gas manages its business through three reportable segments – gas distribution operations, gas pipeline investments, and gas marketing services, which includes SouthStar, a Marketer and provider of energy-related products and services to natural gas markets – and one non-reportable segment, all other. Prior to the sale of Sequent on July 1, 2021, Southern Company Gas' reportable segments also included wholesale gas services. See Notes 7, 15, and 16 to the financial statements for additional information.Southern Company's other business activities include providing distributed energy and resilience solutions and deploying microgrids for commercial, industrial, governmental, and utility customers, as well as investments in telecommunications. Management continues to evaluate the contribution of each of these activities to total shareholder return and may pursue acquisitions, dispositions, and other strategic ventures or investments accordingly.See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL herein for a discussion of the many factors that could impact the Registrants' future results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.Recent DevelopmentsAlabama PowerOn July 12, 2022, the Alabama PSC approved the following items:•Alabama Power's petition for a certificate of convenience and necessity authorizing Alabama Power to complete the acquisition of the Calhoun Generating Station. The transaction closed on September 30, 2022 and the related costs are being recovered through Rate CNP New Plant, which reflected an increase in annual revenues of $34 million, or 0.6%, effective with November 2022 billings.•An increase to Rate ECR effective with August 2022 billings, which resulted in an increase of approximately $310 million annually. The approved changes in the Rate ECR factor have no significant effect on Alabama Power's net income, but do impact the related operating cash flows.•Modifications to Rate NDR.•An accounting order authorizing Alabama Power to create a reliability reserve separate from the NDR and transition the previous Rate NDR authority related to reliability expenditures to the reliability reserve. Alabama Power may make accruals to the reliability reserve if the NDR balance exceeds $35 million. At December 31, 2022, Alabama Power accrued $166 million to the reserve.II-3 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISOn September 23, 2022, the FERC authorized Alabama Power to use updated depreciation rates from its 2021 depreciation study effective January 2023. The updated depreciation rates are expected to result in an approximately $500 million increase in annual depreciation expense.On November 1, 2022, the Alabama PSC approved an increase to Rate ECR of approximately $500 million annually effective with December 2022 billings. The approved changes in the Rate ECR factor have no significant effect on Alabama Power's net income, but do impact operating cash flows related to fuel cost recovery.On December 1, 2022, Alabama Power submitted calculations for Rate CNP Compliance for 2023 which resulted in an annual revenue increase of approximately $255 million, or 3.7%, effective with January 2023 billings, primarily due to updated depreciation rates.On December 6, 2022, the Alabama PSC approved Rate CNP Depreciation, which allows Alabama Power to recover changes in depreciation resulting from updates to certain depreciation rates. Rate CNP Depreciation will result in an annual revenue increase of approximately $318 million, or 4.6%, effective with January 2023 billings. In addition, the Alabama PSC directed Alabama Power to accelerate the amortization of a regulatory liability associated with excess federal accumulated deferred income taxes, which is being returned to customers through bill credits of up to approximately $318 million in 2023 to offset the impact of the Rate CNP Depreciation increase. The Alabama PSC will determine the treatment of any remaining excess federal accumulated deferred income taxes at a future date. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.During 2022, Alabama Power continued construction of Plant Barry Unit 8, which is expected to be placed in service in November 2023. At December 31, 2022, associated project expenditures totaled approximately $518 million.For the year ended December 31, 2022, Alabama Power's weighted common equity return exceeded 6.15%, resulting in Alabama Power establishing a current regulatory liability of $62 million. On February 7, 2023, the Alabama PSC directed Alabama Power to issue the 2022 refund to customers through bill credits in August 2023.See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Alabama Power"" for additional information.Georgia PowerPlant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 Construction and Start-Up StatusConstruction continues on Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 (with electric generating capacity of approximately 1,100 MWs each), in which Georgia Power currently holds a 45.7% ownership interest. Georgia Power's share of the total project capital cost forecast to complete Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, including contingency, through the end of the second quarter 2023 and the first quarter 2024, respectively, is $10.6 billion.On July 29, 2022, Southern Nuclear announced that all Unit 3 ITAACs had been submitted to the NRC. On August 3, 2022, the NRC published its 103(g) finding that the acceptance criteria in the combined license for Unit 3 had been met, which allowed nuclear fuel to be loaded and start-up testing to begin. Fuel load for Unit 3 was completed on October 17, 2022. In early 2023, during the start-up and pre-operational testing for Unit 3, Southern Nuclear identified and is remediating certain equipment and component issues. As a result, Unit 3 is projected to be placed in service during May or June 2023. The projected schedule for Unit 3 primarily depends on the progression of final component and pre-operational testing and start-up, which may be impacted by further equipment, component, and/or other operational challenges. After considering the timeframe and duration of hot functional and other testing and recent experience with Unit 3 start-up and pre-operational testing, Unit 4 is now projected to be placed in service during late fourth quarter 2023 or the first quarter 2024. The projected schedule for Unit 4 primarily depends on potential impacts arising from Unit 4 testing activities overlapping with Unit 3 start-up and commissioning; maintaining overall construction productivity and production levels, particularly in subcontractor scopes of work; and maintaining appropriate levels of craft laborers. Any further delays could result in later in-service dates and cost increases.During 2022, established construction contingency and additional costs totaling $307 million were assigned to the base capital cost forecast for costs primarily associated with schedule extensions, construction productivity, the pace of system turnovers, additional craft and support resources, procurement for Units 3 and 4, and the equipment and component issues identified during Unit 3 start-up and pre-operational testing. During 2022, Georgia Power also increased its total project capital cost forecast by $125 million to replenish construction contingency and $9 million for construction monitoring costs, which were approved for recovery by the Georgia PSC in its nineteenth VCM order. After considering the significant level of uncertainty that exists regarding the future recoverability of these costs since the ultimate outcome of these matters is subject to the outcome of future assessments by management, as well as Georgia PSC decisions in future regulatory proceedings, Georgia Power recorded pre-tax charges to income in the second quarter 2022, the third quarter 2022, and the fourth quarter 2022 of $36 million ($27 million after tax), $32 million ($24 million after tax), and $148 million ($110 million after tax), respectively, for the increases in the total project capital cost forecast. Georgia Power may request the Georgia PSC to evaluate those expenditures for rate recovery during II-4 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISthe prudence review following the Unit 4 fuel load pursuant to the twenty-fourth VCM stipulation described in Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Georgia Power – Nuclear Construction – Regulatory Matters.""Georgia Power and the other Vogtle Owners do not agree on the starting dollar amount for the determination of cost increases subject to the cost-sharing and tender provisions of the Global Amendments (as defined in Note 2 to the financial statements under Georgia Power – Nuclear Construction – Joint Owner Contracts""). The other Vogtle Owners notified Georgia Power that they believe the project capital cost forecast approved by the Vogtle Owners on February 14, 2022 triggered the tender provisions.On June 17, 2022 and July 26, 2022, OPC and Dalton, respectively, notified Georgia Power of their purported exercises of their tender options. Georgia Power did not accept these purported tender exercises. On June 18, 2022, OPC and MEAG Power each filed a separate lawsuit against Georgia Power in the Superior Court of Fulton County, Georgia seeking a declaratory judgment that the starting dollar amount is $17.1 billion and that the cost-sharing and tender provisions have been triggered. On July 25, 2022 and July 28, 2022, Georgia Power filed its answers in the lawsuits filed by MEAG Power and OPC, respectively, and included counterclaims seeking a declaratory judgment that the starting dollar amount is $18.38 billion and that costs related to force majeure events are excluded prior to calculating the cost-sharing and tender provisions and when calculating Georgia Power's related financial obligations. On September 26, 2022, Dalton filed complaints in each of these lawsuits.On September 29, 2022, Georgia Power and MEAG Power reached an agreement to resolve their dispute regarding the proper interpretation of the cost-sharing and tender provisions of the Global Amendments. Under the terms of the agreement, among other items, (i) MEAG Power will not exercise its tender option and will retain its full ownership interest in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4; (ii) Georgia Power will reimburse a portion of MEAG Power's costs of construction for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 as such costs are incurred and with no further adjustment for force majeure costs, which payments will total approximately $92 million based on the current project capital cost forecast; and (iii) Georgia Power will reimburse 20% of MEAG Power's costs of construction with respect to any amounts over the current project capital cost forecast, with no further adjustment for force majeure costs. On October 4, 2022, MEAG Power and Georgia Power filed a notice of settlement and voluntary dismissal of the pending litigation described above, including Georgia Power's counterclaim, and, on October 6, 2022, Dalton dismissed its related complaint. Georgia Power recorded pre-tax charges (credits) to income in the fourth quarter 2021, the second quarter 2022, the third quarter 2022, and the fourth quarter 2022 of approximately $440 million ($328 million after tax), $16 million ($12 million after tax), $(102) million ($(76) million after tax), and $53 million ($40 million after tax), respectively, associated with the cost-sharing and tender provisions of the Global Amendments, including the settlement with MEAG Power. A total of $407 million associated with these provisions is included in the total project capital cost forecast and will not be recovered from retail customers. The settlement with MEAG Power does not resolve the separate pending litigation with OPC, including Dalton's associated complaint, described above. Georgia Power may be required to record further pre-tax charges to income of up to approximately $345 million associated with the cost-sharing and tender provisions of the Global Amendments for OPC and Dalton based on the current project capital cost forecast.Georgia Power's ownership interest in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 continues to be 45.7%. Georgia Power believes the increases in the total project capital cost forecast through December 31, 2022 will trigger the tender provisions, but Georgia Power disagrees with OPC and Dalton on the tender provisions trigger date. Valid notices of tender from OPC and Dalton would require Georgia Power to pay 100% of their respective remaining shares of the costs necessary to complete Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Georgia Power's incremental ownership interest will be calculated and conveyed to Georgia Power after Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 are placed in service.The ultimate impact of these matters on the construction schedule and project capital cost forecast and related cost recovery for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 cannot be determined at this time. See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Georgia Power – Nuclear Construction"" for additional information.2022 ARPOn December 20, 2022, the Georgia PSC voted to approve the 2022 ARP, including estimated net rate increases totaling $216 million, $377 million, and $403 million effective January 1, 2023, January 1, 2024, and January 1, 2025, respectively. See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Georgia Power – Rate Plans – 2022 ARP"" for additional information.Integrated Resource PlansOn July 21, 2022, the Georgia PSC approved Georgia Power's triennial IRP (2022 IRP), as modified by a stipulated agreement among Georgia Power, the staff of the Georgia PSC, and certain intervenors and as further modified by the Georgia PSC. In the 2022 IRP decision, the Georgia PSC approved several requests, including the following:•Decertification and retirement of Plant Wansley Units 1 and 2 (926 MWs based on 53.5% ownership), which occurred on August 31, 2022, and Plant Scherer Unit 3 (614 MWs based on 75% ownership) by December 31, 2028, as well as the II-5 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISreclassification to regulatory asset accounts of the remaining net book values of these units and any remaining unusable materials and supplies inventories upon retirement.•Decertification and retirement of Plant Gaston Units 1 through 4 (500 MWs based on 50% ownership through SEGCO) by December 31, 2028. See Note 7 to the financial statements under ""SEGCO"" for additional information.•Georgia Power's environmental compliance strategy, including approval of Georgia Power's plans to address CCR at its ash ponds and landfills.The Georgia PSC deferred a decision on the requested decertification and retirement of Plant Bowen Units 1 and 2 (1,400 MWs) to the 2025 IRP.See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Georgia Power – Integrated Resource Plans"" for additional information.Mississippi PowerOn June 7, 2022, the Mississippi PSC approved Mississippi Power's annual retail PEP filing for 2022, resulting in an annual increase in revenues of approximately $18 million, or 1.9%, effective with the first billing cycle of April 2022.On August 26, 2022, the FERC accepted an amended shared service agreement (SSA) between Mississippi Power and Cooperative Energy, effective July 1, 2022, under which Cooperative Energy will continue to decrease its use of Mississippi Power's generation services under the MRA tariff up to 2.5% annually through 2035. At December 31, 2022, Mississippi Power is serving approximately 400 MWs of Cooperative Energy's annual demand. Beginning in 2036, Cooperative Energy will provide 100% of its electricity requirements at the MRA delivery points under the tariff. Neither party has the option to cancel the amended SSA. Mississippi Power expects to remarket this capacity, including the potential development of future arrangements with Cooperative Energy.On July 15, 2022, Mississippi Power filed a request with the FERC for a $23 million increase in annual wholesale base revenues under the MRA tariff. Cooperative Energy filed a complaint with the FERC challenging the new rates. On September 13, 2022, the FERC issued an order that accepted Mississippi Power's request effective September 14, 2022, subject to refund, and established hearing and settlement judge procedures. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.On November 15, 2022, Mississippi Power filed a request with the Mississippi PSC to increase retail fuel revenues by $25 million annually effective with the first billing cycle of February 2023 and an additional $25 million annually effective with the first billing cycle of June 2023. On January 10, 2023, the Mississippi PSC voted to defer approval of the filing. Mississippi Power is allowed to maintain current billing rates and continue accruing its weighted-average cost of capital on any under or over fuel recovery balance. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.On December 6, 2022, the Mississippi PSC approved an accounting order authorizing Mississippi Power to create a reliability reserve for the purpose of deferring generation, transmission, and distribution reliability-related expenditures for use in a future year, under certain conditions. At December 31, 2022, Mississippi Power accrued $25 million to the reliability reserve.See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Mississippi Power"" for additional information.Southern PowerDuring 2022, Southern Power completed construction of and placed in service the remaining 40 MWs of the Tranquillity battery energy storage facility (72 MWs total) and the remaining 15 MWs of the Garland battery energy storage facility (88 MWs total).Southern Power calculates an investment coverage ratio for its generating assets, including those owned with various partners, based on the ratio of investment under contract to total investment using the respective facilities' net book value (or expected in-service value for facilities under construction) as the investment amount. With the inclusion of investments associated with facilities under construction, as well as other capacity and energy contracts, Southern Power's average investment coverage ratio at December 31, 2022 was 96% through 2027 and 90% through 2032, with an average remaining contract duration of approximately 12 years.See Note 15 to the financial statements under ""Southern Power"" for additional information.Southern Company GasOn August 1, 2022, Virginia Natural Gas filed a general base rate case with the Virginia Commission seeking an increase in annual base rate revenues of $69 million, including $15 million related to the recovery of investments under the SAVE program, primarily to recover investments and increased costs associated with infrastructure, technology, and workforce development. The requested increase is based on a projected 12-month period beginning January 1, 2023, a ROE of 10.35%, and an equity ratio of II-6 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS53.2%. Rate adjustments became effective January 1, 2023, subject to refund. The Virginia Commission is expected to rule on the requested increase in the third quarter 2023. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.On September 7, 2022, certain affiliates of Southern Company Gas entered into agreements to sell two natural gas storage facilities located in California and Texas for an aggregate purchase price of $186 million, plus working capital and certain other adjustments. The sale of the Texas facility was completed on November 18, 2022 and completion of the sale of the California facility is expected later in 2023. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time. Southern Company Gas recorded pre-tax impairment charges totaling approximately $131 million ($99 million after tax) in the fourth quarter 2022 related to the facilities. See Note 15 to the financial statements under ""Southern Company Gas"" for additional information.On December 20, 2022, the Georgia PSC approved Atlanta Gas Light's annual GRAM filing, which resulted in an annual rate increase of $53 million effective January 1, 2023.On January 3, 2023, Nicor Gas filed a general base rate case with the Illinois Commission requesting a $321 million increase in annual base rate revenues, including $59 million related to the recovery of investments under the Investing in Illinois program through December 31, 2023. The requested increase is based on a projected test year for the 12-month period ending December 31, 2024, a return on equity of 10.35%, and an equity ratio of 54.5%. Further, Nicor Gas is seeking to recover an additional $32 million under three proposed riders related to recovery of vehicle fuel costs, company use gas, and customer payment fees. The Illinois Commission is expected to rule on the requested increase within the 11-month statutory time limit, after which rate adjustments will be effective. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.Key Performance IndicatorsIn striving to achieve attractive risk-adjusted returns while providing cost-effective energy to approximately 8.8 million electric and gas utility customers collectively, the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Company Gas continue to focus on several key performance indicators. These indicators include, but are not limited to, customer satisfaction, plant availability, electric and natural gas system reliability, and execution of major construction projects. In addition, Southern Company and the Subsidiary Registrants focus on earnings per share (EPS) and net income, respectively, as a key performance indicator. See RESULTS OF OPERATIONS herein for information on the Registrants' financial performance. See RESULTS OF OPERATIONS – ""Southern Company Gas – Operating Metrics"" for additional information on Southern Company Gas' operating metrics, including Heating Degree Days, customer count, and volumes of natural gas sold.The financial success of the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Company Gas is directly tied to customer satisfaction. Key elements of ensuring customer satisfaction include outstanding service, high reliability, and competitive prices. The traditional electric operating companies use customer satisfaction surveys to evaluate their results and generally target the top quartile of these surveys in measuring performance. Reliability indicators are also used to evaluate results. See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Alabama Power – Rate RSE"" and ""Mississippi Power – Performance Evaluation Plan"" for additional information on Alabama Power's Rate RSE and Mississippi Power's PEP rate plan, respectively, both of which contain mechanisms that directly tie customer service indicators to the allowed equity return.Southern Power continues to focus on several key performance indicators, including, but not limited to, the equivalent forced outage rate and contract availability to evaluate operating results and help ensure its ability to meet its contractual commitments to customers.RESULTS OF OPERATIONSSouthern CompanyConsolidated net income attributable to Southern Company was $3.5 billion in 2022, an increase of $1.1 billion, or 47.3%, from 2021. The increase was primarily due to a $1.1 billion decrease in after-tax charges related to the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, increases in retail electric revenues associated with rates and pricing, warmer weather, primarily in the second quarter 2022, and sales growth, and increases in natural gas revenues from base rate increases and continued infrastructure replacement, partially offset by higher non-fuel operations and maintenance costs and higher interest expense. See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Georgia Power – Nuclear Construction"" for additional information.Basic EPS was $3.28 in 2022 and $2.26 in 2021. Diluted EPS, which factors in additional shares related to stock-based compensation, was $3.26 in 2022 and $2.24 in 2021. EPS for 2022 and 2021 was negatively impacted by $0.04 and $0.01 per share, respectively, as a result of increases in the average shares outstanding. See Note 8 to the financial statements under ""Outstanding Classes of Capital Stock – Southern Company"" for additional information.Dividends paid per share of common stock were $2.70 in 2022 and $2.62 in 2021. In January 2023, Southern Company declared a quarterly dividend of 68 cents per share. For 2022, the dividend payout ratio was 82% compared to 116% for 2021.II-7 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISDiscussion of Southern Company's results of operations is divided into three parts – the Southern Company system's primary business of electricity sales, its gas business, and its other business activities.20222021(in millions)Electricity business$3,672 $2,247 Gas business572 539 Other business activities(720)(393)Net Income$3,524 $2,393 Electricity BusinessSouthern Company's electric utilities generate and sell electricity to retail and wholesale customers.

Details of electric operating revenues were as follows: 20222021 (in millions)Retail electric — prior year$14,852 Estimated change resulting from —Rates and pricing451 Sales growth165 Weather244 Fuel and other cost recovery2,485 Retail electric — current year$18,197 $14,852 Wholesale electric revenues3,641 2,455 Other electric revenues747 718 Other revenues288 275 Electric operating revenues$22,873 $18,300 Retail electric revenues increased $3.3 billion, or 22.5%, in 2022 as compared to 2021. The significant factors driving this change are shown in the preceding table. The increase in rates and pricing in 2022 was primarily due to increases at Georgia Power resulting from higher contributions by commercial and industrial customers with variable demand-driven pricing, base tariff increases in accordance with the 2019 ARP, and pricing effects associated with customer usage. In addition, Alabama Power made a larger Rate RSE customer refund in 2021. These increases were partially offset by revenue reductions resulting from Georgia Power's retail ROE exceeding the allowed retail ROE range in 2022.Electric rates for the traditional electric operating companies include provisions to adjust billings for fluctuations in fuel costs, including the energy component of purchased power costs. Under these provisions, fuel revenues generally equal fuel expenses, including the energy component of PPA costs, and do not affect net income. The traditional electric operating companies each have one or more regulatory mechanisms to recover other costs such as environmental and other compliance costs, storm damage, new plants, and PPA capacity costs.See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Alabama Power"" and ""Georgia Power"" for additional information. Also see ""Energy Sales"" herein for a discussion of changes in the volume of energy sold, including changes related to sales growth (decline) and weather.Wholesale electric revenues from power sales were as follows:20222021 (in millions)Capacity and other$625 $550 Energy3,016 1,905Total$3,641 $2,455 In 2022, wholesale electric revenues increased $1.2 billion, or 48.3%, as compared to 2021 due to increases of $1.1 billion in energy revenues and $75 million in capacity revenues. Energy revenues increased $744 million at Southern Power primarily due to fuel and purchased power increases compared to 2021 and an increase in the volume of KWHs sold primarily associated with natural gas PPAs. Energy revenues increased $367 million at the traditional electric operating companies primarily due to higher natural gas and coal prices. The increase in capacity revenues was primarily due to a net increase in natural gas PPAs at Southern Power and increased opportunity sales at Alabama Power due to warmer weather.Wholesale electric revenues consist of revenues from PPAs and short-term opportunity sales. Wholesale electric revenues from PPAs (other than solar and wind PPAs) have both capacity and energy components. Capacity revenues generally represent the greatest contribution to net income and are designed to provide recovery of fixed costs plus a return on investment. Energy revenues will vary depending on fuel prices, the market prices of wholesale energy compared to the Southern Company system's generation, demand for energy within the Southern Company system's electric service territory, and the availability of the Southern Company system's generation. Increases and decreases in energy revenues that are driven by fuel prices are II-9 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISaccompanied by an increase or decrease in fuel costs and do not have a significant impact on net income. Energy sales from solar and wind PPAs do not have a capacity charge and customers either purchase the energy output of a dedicated renewable facility through an energy charge or through a fixed price related to the energy. As a result, the ability to recover fixed and variable operations and maintenance expenses is dependent upon the level of energy generated from these facilities, which can be impacted by weather conditions, equipment performance, transmission constraints, and other factors. Wholesale electric revenues at Mississippi Power include FERC-regulated MRA sales under cost-based tariffs as well as market-based sales. Short-term opportunity sales are made at market-based rates that generally provide a margin above the Southern Company system's variable cost to produce the energy.Other Electric RevenuesOther electric revenues increased $29 million, or 4.0%, in 2022 as compared to 2021. The increase was primarily due to increases of $54 million in transmission revenues primarily associated with open access transmission tariff sales, $18 million in outdoor lighting sales at Georgia Power, $13 million in cogeneration steam revenues associated with higher natural gas prices at Alabama Power, and $11 million in rent revenues at the traditional electric operating companies, partially offset by a decrease of $32 million resulting from the termination of a transmission service contract, an increase of $18 million in realized losses associated with price stability products for retail customers on variable demand-driven pricing tariffs, and a decrease of $17 million from retail solar programs as a result of higher avoided cost credits to customers, all at Georgia Power.Energy SalesChanges in revenues are influenced heavily by the change in the volume of energy sold from year to year. KWH sales for 2022 and the percent change from 2021 were as follows:2022TotalKWHsTotal KWHPercent ChangeWeather-AdjustedPercent Change(*)(in billions)Residential49.6 4.8 %0.2 %Commercial48.3 3.5 2.0 Industrial49.5 1.5 1.5 Other0.6 (4.8)(4.8)Total retail148.0 3.2 1.2 %Wholesale56.3 12.6 Total energy sales204.3 5.6 %(*)Weather-adjusted KWH sales are estimated using statistical models of the historical relationship between temperatures and energy sales, and then removing the estimated effect of deviations from normal temperature conditions. Normal temperature conditions are defined as those experienced in the applicable service territory over a specified historical period. This metric is useful because it allows trends in historical operations to be evaluated apart from the influence of weather conditions. Management also considers this metric in developing long-term capital and financial plans.Changes in retail energy sales are generally the result of changes in electricity usage by customers, weather, and the number of customers. Weather-adjusted retail energy sales increased 1.8 billion KWHs in 2022 as compared to 2021. Weather-adjusted residential KWH sales and weather-adjusted commercial KWH sales increased 0.2% and 2.0%, respectively, in 2022 when compared to 2021 largely due to customer growth. In addition, commercial customer usage increased and residential customer usage decreased in 2022 when compared to 2021 as customers returned to pre-pandemic levels of activity outside the home. Industrial KWH sales increased 1.5% in 2022 when compared to 2021 primarily due to increases in the pipeline and paper sectors, partially offset by a decrease in the chemicals sector.See ""Electric Operating Revenues"" above for a discussion of significant changes in wholesale revenues related to changes in price and KWH sales.Other RevenuesOther revenues increased $13 million, or 4.7%, in 2022 as compared to 2021. The increase was primarily due to increases of $10 million in unregulated lighting sales at Alabama Power and $7 million associated with energy conservation projects at Georgia Power.II-10 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISFuel and Purchased Power ExpensesThe mix of fuel sources for the generation of electricity is determined primarily by demand, the unit cost of fuel consumed, and the availability of generating units. Additionally, the electric utilities purchase a portion of their electricity needs from the wholesale market.Details of the Southern Company system's generation and purchased power were as follows:20222021Total generation (in billions of KWHs)(a)186 179 Total purchased power (in billions of KWHs)25 18 Sources of generation (percent) —Gas51 48 Coal22 22 Nuclear16 18 Hydro3 4 Wind, Solar, and Other8 8 Cost of fuel, generated (in cents per net KWH) —Gas(a)5.29 3.07 Coal3.67 2.85 Nuclear0.72 0.75 Average cost of fuel, generated (in cents per net KWH)(a)4.05 2.55 Average cost of purchased power (in cents per net KWH)(b)7.66 5.85 (a)Excludes Central Alabama Generating Station KWHs and associated cost of fuel through July 12, 2022 as its fuel was previously provided by the purchaser under a power sales agreement. See Note 15 to the financial statements under ""Alabama Power"" for additional information.(b)Average cost of purchased power includes fuel purchased by the Southern Company system for tolling agreements where power is generated by the provider.In 2022, total fuel and purchased power expenses were $8.4 billion, an increase of $3.4 billion, or 69.0%, as compared to 2021. The increase was primarily the result of a $2.8 billion increase in the average cost of fuel generated and purchased and a $653 million increase in the volume of KWHs generated and purchased.Fuel and purchased power energy transactions at the traditional electric operating companies are generally offset by fuel revenues and do not have a significant impact on net income. See Note 2 to the financial statements for additional information. Fuel expenses incurred under Southern Power's PPAs are generally the responsibility of the counterparties and do not significantly impact net income.FuelIn 2022, fuel expense was $6.8 billion, an increase of $2.8 billion, or 70.4%, as compared to 2021. The increase was primarily due to a 72.3% increase in the average cost of natural gas per KWH generated, a 28.8% increase in the average cost of coal per KWH generated, an 11.1% decrease in the volume of KWHs generated by hydro, and a 9.0% increase in the volume of KWHs generated by natural gas.Purchased PowerIn 2022, purchased power expense was $1.6 billion, an increase of $615 million, or 62.9%, as compared to 2021. The increase was primarily due to a 38.2% increase in the volume of KWHs purchased and a 30.9% increase in the average cost per KWH purchased primarily due to higher natural gas and coal prices.Energy purchases will vary depending on demand for energy within the Southern Company system's electric service territory, the market prices of wholesale energy as compared to the cost of the Southern Company system's generation, and the availability of the Southern Company system's generation.Other Operations and Maintenance ExpensesOther operations and maintenance expenses increased $459 million, or 9.5%, in 2022 as compared to 2021. The increase was primarily associated with increases of $247 million in transmission and distribution expenses, $95 million in generation expenses primarily related to scheduled outage and maintenance costs, $25 million for a reliability reserve accrual in 2022 at Mississippi II-11 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISPower, and $22 million in amortization of cloud software. The transmission and distribution increase was primarily due to increased line maintenance, as well as the net impact of Alabama Power accruals of $166 million to the reliability reserve in 2022 and an incremental $65 million to the NDR in 2021. See Note 1 to the financial statements under ""Storm Damage and Reliability Reserves"" for additional information.Depreciation and AmortizationDepreciation and amortization increased $76 million, or 2.6%, in 2022 as compared to 2021. The increase was primarily due to additional plant in service.Taxes Other Than Income TaxesTaxes other than income taxes increased $63 million, or 5.9%, in 2022 as compared to 2021. The increase primarily reflects an increase in municipal franchise fees associated with higher retail revenues at Georgia Power.Estimated Loss on Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4Georgia Power recorded pre-tax charges to income for the estimated probable loss on Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 totaling $183 million and $1.7 billion in 2022 and 2021, respectively. The charges to income in each year were recorded to reflect Georgia Power's revised total project capital cost forecast to complete construction and start-up of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Georgia Power – Nuclear Construction"" for additional information.Gain on Dispositions, NetGain on dispositions, net decreased $20 million, or 33.9%, in 2022 as compared to 2021 primarily due to a net decrease of $39 million in gains at Southern Power related to contributions of wind turbine equipment to various equity method investments in 2021, partially offset by $17 million in gains from sales of integrated transmission system assets at Georgia Power in 2022. See Notes 7 and 15 to the financial statements under ""Southern Power"" for additional information.Allowance for Equity Funds Used During ConstructionAllowance for equity funds used during construction increased $31 million, or 17.3%, in 2022 as compared to 2021. The increase was primarily associated with an increase in capital expenditures related to Plant Barry Unit 8 construction at Alabama Power and an increase in capital expenditures subject to AFUDC at Georgia Power. See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Alabama Power – Certificates of Convenience and Necessity"" for additional information.Interest Expense, Net of Amounts CapitalizedInterest expense, net of amounts capitalized increased $99 million, or 10.2%, in 2022 as compared to 2021. The increase reflects approximately $54 million related to higher average outstanding borrowings and $43 million related to higher interest rates. See Note 8 to the financial statements for additional information.Other Income (Expense), NetOther income (expense), net increased $89 million, or 20.8%, in 2022 as compared to 2021 primarily due to a $68 million increase in non-service cost-related retirement benefits income and a $23 million increase in interest income, partially offset by a $33 million increase in charitable donations at the traditional electric operating companies. See Note 11 to the financial statements for additional information.Income TaxesIncome taxes increased $629 million in 2022 as compared to 2021. The increase was primarily due to higher pre-tax earnings largely resulting from a decrease in charges associated with the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 and an increase in a valuation allowance and other adjustments related to certain state tax credit carryforwards at Georgia Power. See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Georgia Power – Nuclear Construction"" and Note 10 to the financial statements for additional information.Net Loss Attributable to Noncontrolling InterestsSubstantially all noncontrolling interests relate to renewable projects at Southern Power. Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests increased $8 million, or 8.1%, in 2022 as compared to 2021. The increased loss was primarily due to $28 million in higher HLBV loss allocations to Southern Power's tax equity partners in 2022, largely offset by $23 million in loss allocations associated with the Garland and Tranquillity battery energy storage facilities being placed in service in 2021. See Notes 9 and 15 to the financial statements under ""Lessor"" and ""Southern Power,"" respectively, for additional information.II-12 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISGas BusinessSouthern Company Gas distributes natural gas through utilities in four states and is involved in several other complementary businesses including gas pipeline investments, wholesale gas services (until the sale of Sequent on July 1, 2021), and gas marketing services.A condensed statement of income for the gas business follows: 2022Increase (Decrease) from 2021 (in millions)Operating revenues$5,962 $1,582 Cost of natural gas3,004 1,385 Other operations and maintenance1,176 104 Depreciation and amortization559 23 Taxes other than income taxes282 57 Impairment charges131 131 Gain on dispositions, net(4)123 Total operating expenses5,148 1,823 Operating income814 (241)Earnings from equity method investments148 98 Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized263 25 Other income (expense), net53 106 Income taxes180 (95)Net income$572 $33 Seasonality of ResultsDuring the period from November through March when natural gas usage and operating revenues are generally higher (Heating Season), more customers are connected to Southern Company Gas' distribution systems and natural gas usage is higher in periods of colder weather. Prior to the sale of Sequent, wholesale gas services' operating revenues were occasionally impacted due to peak usage by power generators in response to summer energy demands. Southern Company Gas' base operating expenses, excluding cost of natural gas, bad debt expense, and certain incentive compensation costs, are incurred relatively equally over any given year. Thus, operating results can vary significantly from quarter to quarter as a result of seasonality. For 2022, the percentage of operating revenues and net income generated during the Heating Season (January through March and November through December) were 67% and 66%, respectively. For 2021, the percentage of operating revenues and net income generated during the Heating Season were 70% and 102%, respectively.II-13 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISOperating RevenuesOperating revenues in 2022 were $6.0 billion, reflecting a $1.6 billion, or 36.1%, increase compared to 2021. Details of operating revenues were as follows:2022(in millions)Operating revenues – prior year$4,380 Estimated change resulting from –Infrastructure replacement programs and base rate changes252 Gas costs and other cost recovery1,468 Gas marketing services15 Wholesale gas services(187)Other34 Operating revenues – current year$5,962 Revenues at the natural gas distribution utilities increased in 2022 compared to 2021 due to rate increases at Nicor Gas, Atlanta Gas Light, and Chattanooga Gas and continued investment in infrastructure replacement. See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Southern Company Gas"" for additional information.Revenues associated with gas costs and other cost recovery increased in 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to higher natural gas cost recovery as a result of higher volumes of natural gas sold and an increase in natural gas prices. The natural gas distribution utilities have weather or revenue normalization mechanisms that mitigate revenue fluctuations from customer consumption changes. Natural gas distribution rates include provisions to adjust billings for fluctuations in natural gas costs. Therefore, gas costs recovered through natural gas revenues generally equal the amount expensed in cost of natural gas and do not affect net income from the natural gas distribution utilities. See ""Cost of Natural Gas"" herein for additional information.The change in 2022 revenues related to wholesale gas services was due to the sale of Sequent on July 1, 2021. See Note 15 to the financial statements under ""Southern Company Gas"" for additional information.Southern Company Gas hedged its exposure to warmer-than-normal weather in Illinois for gas distribution operations and in Illinois and Georgia for gas marketing services. The remaining impacts of weather on earnings were immaterial.Cost of Natural GasExcluding Atlanta Gas Light, which does not sell natural gas to end-use customers, the natural gas distribution utilities rates include provisions to adjust billings for fluctuations in natural gas costs. Therefore, gas costs recovered through natural gas revenues generally equal the amount expensed in cost of natural gas and do not affect net income from the natural gas distribution utilities. See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Southern Company Gas – Natural Gas Cost Recovery"" for additional information. Cost of natural gas at the natural gas distribution utilities represented 87.5% of the total cost of natural gas for 2022.Gas marketing services customers are charged for actual and estimated natural gas consumed. Cost of natural gas includes the cost of fuel and associated transportation costs, lost and unaccounted for gas, adjustments to reduce the value of inventories to market value, if applicable, and gains and losses associated with certain derivatives.Cost of natural gas was $3.0 billion, an increase of $1.4 billion, or 85.5%, in 2022 compared to 2021, which reflects higher gas cost recovery in 2022 as a result of higher volumes sold and a 73.0% increase in natural gas prices compared to 2021.Other Operations and Maintenance ExpensesOther operations and maintenance expenses increased $104 million, or 9.7%, in 2022 compared to 2021. Excluding $66 million of expenses related to Sequent in 2021, other operations and maintenance expenses increased approximately $174 million. The increase was primarily due to increases of $64 million in compensation and benefit expenses, $43 million in expenses passed through directly to customers primarily related to bad debt at the natural gas distribution utilities, $31 million primarily related to bad debt, customer service, and sales expenses, and $18 million primarily related to pipeline compliance.II-14 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISDepreciation and AmortizationDepreciation and amortization increased $23 million, or 4.3%, in 2022 compared to 2021. The increase was primarily due to continued infrastructure investments at the natural gas distribution utilities. See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Southern Company Gas – Infrastructure Replacement Programs and Capital Projects"" for additional information.Taxes Other Than Income TaxesTaxes other than income taxes increased $57 million, or 25.3%, in 2022 compared to 2021. The increase was primarily due to a $39 million increase in revenue tax expenses as a result of higher natural gas revenues and an $11 million increase in invested capital tax expense at Nicor Gas. Revenue tax expenses are passed through directly to customers and have no impact on net income.Impairment ChargesIn 2022, Southern Company Gas recorded pre-tax impairment charges totaling approximately $131 million ($99 million after tax) as a result of an agreement to sell two natural gas storage facilities. See Note 15 to the financial statements under ""Southern Company Gas"" for additional information.Gain on Dispositions, NetIn 2021, Southern Company Gas recorded a $121 million gain on the sale of Sequent. See Note 15 to the financial statements under ""Southern Company Gas"" for additional information.Earnings from Equity Method InvestmentsEarnings from equity method investments increased $98 million in 2022 compared to 2021. The increase was primarily due to pre-tax impairment charges totaling $84 million in 2021 related to the PennEast Pipeline project and higher earnings at SNG resulting from higher revenues primarily due to increased demand. See Note 7 to the financial statements under ""Southern Company Gas"" for additional information.Interest Expense, Net of Amounts CapitalizedInterest expense, net of amounts capitalized increased $25 million, or 10.5%, in 2022 compared to 2021. The increase reflects approximately $16 million related to higher average outstanding borrowings and $8 million related to higher interest rates. See Note 8 to the financial statements for additional information.Other Income (Expense), NetOther income (expense), net increased $106 million in 2022 compared to 2021. The increase was largely due to charitable contributions by Sequent prior to its sale totaling $101 million in 2021 and an increase of $10 million primarily related to non-service cost-related retirement benefits income. See Note 11 to the financial statements under ""Southern Company Gas"" for additional information.Income TaxesIncome taxes decreased $95 million, or 34.5%, in 2022 compared to 2021. The decrease was primarily due to additional tax benefit of $110 million resulting from the sale of Sequent in 2021 and $32 million as a result of the impairment related to the agreement to sell two natural gas storage facilities in 2022. The decrease was partially offset by $17 million of tax benefits in 2021 resulting from the impairment charge related to the PennEast Pipeline project and higher pre-tax earnings in 2022. See Notes 7 and 15 to the financial statements under ""Southern Company Gas"" and Note 10 to the financial statements for additional information.Other Business ActivitiesSouthern Company's other business activities primarily include the parent company (which does not allocate operating expenses to business units); PowerSecure, which provides distributed energy and resilience solutions and deploys microgrids for commercial, industrial, governmental, and utility customers; Southern Holdings, which invests in various projects; and Southern Linc, which provides digital wireless communications for use by the Southern Company system and also markets these services to the public and provides fiber optics services within the Southeast.II-15 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISA condensed statement of operations for Southern Company's other business activities follows:2022Increase (Decrease) from 2021(in millions)Operating revenues$444 $11 Cost of other sales268 19 Other operations and maintenance201 (6)Depreciation and amortization75 — Taxes other than income taxes4 — Impairment charges119 119 Gain on dispositions, net(14)(14)Total operating expenses653 118 Operating income (loss)(209)(107)Earnings from equity method investments3 (23)Interest expense692 61 Impairment of leveraged leases— (7)Other income (expense), net(55)(149)Income taxes (benefit)(233)(6)Net loss$(720)$(327)Cost of Other SalesCost of other sales for these other business activities increased $19 million, or 7.6%, in 2022 as compared to 2021 primarily due to distributed infrastructure projects at PowerSecure.Impairment ChargesIn 2022, a goodwill impairment charge of $119 million was recorded at PowerSecure. See Note 1 to the financial statements under ""Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets and Liabilities"" for additional information.Gain on Dispositions, NetIn 2022, a $14 million gain was recorded at the parent company as a result of the early termination of the transition services agreement related to the 2019 sale of Gulf Power.Earnings from Equity Method InvestmentsEarnings from equity method investments for these other business activities decreased $23 million, or 88.5%, in 2022 as compared to 2021 primarily due to a decrease in investment income at Southern Holdings.Interest ExpenseInterest expense for these other business activities increased $61 million, or 9.7%, in 2022 as compared to 2021. The increase primarily results from parent company financing activities and includes approximately $52 million related to higher average outstanding borrowings, $15 million related to fair value hedge amortization, $11 million related to higher interest rates, and $7 million in fees associated with remarketing the 2019 Series A Equity Units (Equity Units), partially offset by a $23 million loss in 2021 associated with the extinguishment of debt. See Note 8 to the financial statements for additional information.Other Income (Expense), NetOther income (expense), net for these other business activities decreased $149 million in 2022 as compared to 2021 primarily due to a $93 million pre-tax gain ($99 million gain after tax) recorded at Southern Holdings in 2021 related to the termination of two leveraged leases and a $24 million decrease in leveraged lease income as a result of the terminations. See Note 15 to the financial statements under ""Southern Company"" for additional information.II-16 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISAlabama PowerAlabama Power's 2022 net income after dividends on preferred stock was $1.34 billion, representing a $102 million, or 8.2%, increase from 2021. The increase was primarily due to an increase in retail revenues associated with a larger Rate RSE customer refund in 2021, warmer weather in Alabama Power's service territory in 2022 compared to 2021, and sales growth. Also contributing to the increase in net income were increases in other operating revenues associated with transmission revenues and unregulated lighting sales, as well as an increase in AFUDC, partially offset by higher non-fuel operations and maintenance costs associated with a reliability reserve accrual and higher interest expense.A condensed income statement for Alabama Power follows:2022Increase(Decrease)from 2021(in millions)Operating revenues$7,817 $1,404 Fuel1,840 605 Purchased power801 433 Other operations and maintenance1,935 200 Depreciation and amortization875 16 Taxes other than income taxes424 14 Total operating expenses5,875 1,268 Operating income1,942 136 Allowance for equity funds used during construction70 18 Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized382 42 Other income (expense), net144 37 Income taxes423 51 Net income1,351 98 Dividends on preferred stock11 (4)Net income after dividends on preferred stock$1,340 $102 Operating RevenuesOperating revenues for 2022 were $7.8 billion, reflecting a $1.4 billion, or 21.9%, increase from 2021.

The significant factors driving this change are shown in the preceding table. The increase was primarily due to an increase in fuel and other cost recovery, as well as an increase in revenue driven by a larger Rate RSE customer refund in 2021, warmer weather in 2022 compared to 2021, and sales growth in all major retail classes.See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Alabama Power – Rate ECR,"" "" – Rate RSE,"" and "" – Rate CNP Compliance"" for additional information. See ""Energy Sales"" herein for a discussion of changes in the volume of energy sold, including changes related to sales growth and weather.Electric rates include provisions to recognize the recovery of fuel costs, purchased power costs, PPAs certificated by the Alabama PSC, and costs associated with the NDR. Under these provisions, fuel and other cost recovery revenues generally equal fuel and other cost recovery expenses and do not affect net income. See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Alabama Power"" for additional information.Wholesale revenues from sales to non-affiliated utilities were as follows:20222021(in millions)Capacity and other$213 $173 Energy513 204 Total non-affiliated$726 $377 In 2022, wholesale revenues from sales to non-affiliates increased $349 million, or 92.6%, as compared to 2021 due to a $309 million increase in energy revenues primarily related to higher natural gas prices and a $40 million increase in capacity revenues primarily related to increased opportunity sales due to warmer weather in 2022 as compared to 2021.Wholesale revenues from sales to non-affiliates will vary depending on fuel prices, the market prices of wholesale energy compared to the cost of Alabama Power's and the Southern Company system's generation, demand for energy within the Southern Company system's electric service territory, and the availability of the Southern Company system's generation. Increases and decreases in energy revenues that are driven by fuel prices are accompanied by an increase or decrease in fuel costs and do not affect net income. Short-term opportunity energy sales are also included in wholesale energy sales to non-affiliates. These opportunity sales are made at market-based rates that generally provide a margin above Alabama Power's variable cost to produce the energy.In 2022, wholesale revenues from sales to affiliates increased $31 million, or 18.1%, as compared to 2021. The revenue increase reflects a 64.7% increase in the price of energy due to higher natural gas prices, partially offset by a 28.1% decrease in KWH sales due to the availability of lower cost Southern Company system resources compared to Alabama Power's generation.Wholesale revenues from sales to affiliated companies will vary depending on demand and the availability and cost of generating resources at each company. These affiliate sales and purchases are made in accordance with the IIC, as approved by the FERC. These transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings since this energy is generally sold at marginal cost and energy purchases are generally offset by energy revenues through Alabama Power's energy cost recovery clause.In 2022, other operating revenues increased $53 million, or 14.5%, as compared to 2021 primarily due to increases of $19 million in transmission revenues primarily due to open access transmission tariff sales, $13 million in cogeneration steam revenue associated with higher natural gas prices, $10 million in unregulated lighting sales, and $9 million in rent revenues.II-18 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISEnergy SalesChanges in revenues are influenced heavily by the change in the volume of energy sold from year to year. KWH sales for 2022 and the percent change from 2021 were as follows:2022TotalKWHsTotal KWHPercent ChangeWeather-AdjustedPercent Change(*)(in billions)Residential18.4 5.4 %0.1 %Commercial13.1 2.6 0.1 Industrial20.9 0.5 0.5 Other0.1 (10.1)(10.1)Total retail52.5 2.7 0.2 %Wholesale Non-affiliates12.7 29.1 Affiliates3.7 (28.1)Total wholesale16.4 9.3 Total energy sales68.9 4.2 %(*)Weather-adjusted KWH sales are estimated using statistical models of the historical relationship between temperatures and energy sales, and then removing the estimated effect of deviations from the normal temperature conditions. Normal temperature conditions are defined as those experienced in Alabama Power's service territory over a specified historical period. This metric is useful because it allows trends in historical operations to be evaluated apart from the influence of weather conditions. Management also considers this metric in developing long-term capital and financial plans.Changes in retail energy sales are generally the result of changes in electricity usage by customers, weather, and the number of customers. Revenues attributable to changes in sales increased in 2022 when compared to 2021. In 2022, weather-adjusted residential and commercial KWH sales were flat compared to 2021. Industrial KWH sales increased 0.5% as a result of an increase in demand resulting from changes in production levels primarily in the forest product and pipeline sectors.See ""Operating Revenues"" above for a discussion of significant changes in wholesale revenues from sales to non-affiliates and wholesale revenues from sales to affiliated companies related to changes in price and KWH sales.Fuel and Purchased Power ExpensesThe mix of fuel sources for generation of electricity is determined primarily by the unit cost of fuel consumed, demand, and the availability of generating units. Additionally, Alabama Power purchases a portion of its electricity needs from the wholesale market.II-19 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISDetails of Alabama Power's generation and purchased power were as follows:20222021Total generation (in billions of KWHs)(a)58.358.5 Total purchased power (in billions of KWHs)11.66.4 Sources of generation (percent)(a) —Coal46 46 Nuclear22 26 Gas24 19 Hydro8 9 Cost of fuel, generated (in cents per net KWH) —Coal3.39 2.77 Nuclear0.67 0.70 Gas(a)5.12 2.89 Average cost of fuel, generated (in cents per net KWH)(a)3.19 2.22 Average cost of purchased power (in cents per net KWH)(b)8.00 6.52 (a)Excludes Central Alabama Generating Station KWHs and associated cost of fuel through July 12, 2022 as its fuel was previously provided by the purchaser under a power sales agreement. See Note 15 to the financial statements under ""Alabama Power"" for additional information.(b)Average cost of purchased power includes fuel, energy, and transmission purchased by Alabama Power for tolling agreements where power is generated by the provider.Fuel and purchased power expenses were $2.6 billion in 2022, an increase of $1.0 billion, or 64.8%, compared to 2021. The increase was primarily due to a $648 million increase in the average cost of fuel and purchased power and a $390 million increase related to the volume of KWHs generated and purchased.Fuel and purchased power energy transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings, since energy expenses are generally offset by energy revenues through Alabama Power's energy cost recovery clause. Alabama Power, along with the Alabama PSC, continuously monitors the under/over recovered balance to determine whether adjustments to billing rates are required. See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Alabama Power – Rate ECR"" for additional information.FuelFuel expense was $1.8 billion in 2022, an increase of $605 million, or 49.0%, compared to 2021. The increase was primarily due to a 77.2% increase in the average cost of natural gas per KWH generated, which excludes tolling agreements, a 22.4% increase in the average cost of coal per KWH generated, a 24.1% increase in the volume of KWHs generated by natural gas, and a 9.7% decrease in the volume of KWHs generated by hydro, partially offset by a 13.3% decrease in the volume of KWHs generated by nuclear as a result of the extension of a planned outage.Purchased Power – Non-AffiliatesPurchased power expense from non-affiliates was $441 million in 2022, an increase of $220 million, or 99.5%, compared to 2021. The increase was primarily due to a 90.8% increase in the volume of KWHs purchased as a result of higher weather-related demand in 2022 compared to 2021 and a 10.3% increase in the average cost per KWH purchased due to higher natural gas and coal prices.Energy purchases from non-affiliates will vary depending on the market prices of wholesale energy as compared to the cost of the Southern Company system's generation, demand for energy within the Southern Company system's electric service territory, and the availability of the Southern Company system's generation.Purchased Power – AffiliatesPurchased power expense from affiliates was $360 million in 2022, an increase of $213 million, or 144.9%, compared to 2021. The increase was primarily due to a 58.3% increase in the volume of KWHs purchased as a result of higher weather-related demand in 2022 compared to 2021 and a 54.4% increase in the average cost per KWH purchased due to higher natural gas and coal prices.II-20 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISEnergy purchases from affiliates will vary depending on demand for energy and the availability and cost of generating resources at each company within the Southern Company system. These purchases are made in accordance with the IIC or other contractual agreements, as approved by the FERC.Other Operations and Maintenance ExpensesOther operations and maintenance expenses increased $200 million, or 11.5%, in 2022 as compared to 2021. The increase was primarily due to increases of $147 million in transmission and distribution expenses primarily associated with a $166 million reliability reserve accrual in 2022, partially offset by an incremental $65 million NDR accrual in 2021, as well as other line maintenance, $33 million in generation expenses primarily associated with maintenance and Rate CNP Compliance-related expenses, and $17 million in customer accounts, customer service, and sales expenses primarily associated with labor and bad debt expense. See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Alabama Power – Reliability Reserve Accounting Order"" and "" – Rate CNP Compliance"" for additional information.Depreciation and AmortizationDepreciation and amortization increased $16 million, or 1.9%, in 2022 as compared to 2021 primarily due to an increase of $28 million in depreciation related to an increase in additional plant in service, largely offset by a decrease of $16 million in amortization of regulatory assets associated with the retirement of certain generating plants.Allowance for Equity Funds Used During ConstructionAllowance for equity funds used during construction increased $18 million, or 34.6%, in 2022 as compared to 2021 primarily due to an increase in capital expenditures related to Plant Barry Unit 8 construction, as well as an increase in capital expenditures related to hydro production. See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Alabama Power – Certificates of Convenience and Necessity"" for additional information.Interest Expense, Net of Amounts CapitalizedInterest expense, net of amounts capitalized increased $42 million, or 12.4%, in 2022 as compared to 2021. The increase reflects approximately $36 million related to higher average outstanding borrowings and $12 million related to higher interest rates. See Note 8 to the financial statements for additional information.Other Income (Expense), NetOther income (expense), net increased $37 million, or 34.6%, in 2022 as compared to 2021 primarily due to increases in interest income and non-service cost-related retirement benefits income. See Note 11 to the financial statements for additional information.Income Taxes Income taxes increased $51 million, or 13.7%, in 2022 as compared to 2021 primarily due to higher pre-tax earnings and a decrease in state tax credits. See Note 10 to the financial statements for additional information.Georgia PowerGeorgia Power's 2022 net income was $1.8 billion, representing a $1.2 billion, or 210.4%, increase from the previous year. The increase was primarily due to a $1.1 billion decrease in after-tax charges related to the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, as well as an increase in retail revenues associated with rates and pricing, warmer weather in Georgia Power's service territory compared to 2021, and sales growth. These increases were partially offset by higher non-fuel operations and maintenance costs. See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Georgia Power – Nuclear Construction"" for additional information on the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4.II-21 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISA condensed income statement for Georgia Power follows:2022Increase(Decrease)from 2021(in millions)Operating revenues$11,584 $2,324 Fuel2,486 1,037 Purchased power2,257 766 Other operations and maintenance2,349 136 Depreciation and amortization1,430 59 Taxes other than income taxes527 51 Estimated loss on Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4183 (1,509)Total operating expenses9,232 540 Operating income2,352 1,784 Allowance for equity funds used during construction140 13 Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized485 64 Other income (expense), net176 34 Income taxes (benefit)370 538 Net income$1,813 $1,229 Operating RevenuesOperating revenues for 2022 were $11.6 billion, reflecting a $2.3 billion, or 25.1%, increase from 2021.

The significant factors driving this change are shown in the preceding table. The increase in rates and pricing was primarily due to higher contributions from commercial and industrial customers with variable demand-driven pricing, base tariff increases in accordance with the 2019 ARP, and pricing effects associated with customer usage, partially offset by revenue reductions resulting from Georgia Power's retail ROE exceeding the allowed retail ROE range in 2022. See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Georgia Power – Rate Plans – 2019 ARP"" for additional information.See ""Energy Sales"" below for a discussion of changes in the volume of energy sold, including changes related to the sales growth in 2022.Electric rates include provisions to adjust billings for fluctuations in fuel costs, including the energy component of purchased power costs. Under these fuel cost recovery provisions, fuel revenues generally equal fuel expenses and do not affect net income. See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Georgia Power – Fuel Cost Recovery"" for additional information.II-22 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISWholesale revenues from power sales were as follows:20222021(in millions)Capacity and other$48 $63 Energy187 134 Total $235 $197 In 2022, wholesale revenues increased $38 million, or 19.3%, as compared to 2021 largely due to an increase of $78 million related to the average cost of fuel primarily due to higher natural gas and coal prices, partially offset by a $27 million decrease in KWH sales associated with lower market demand and a $10 million decrease in capacity revenues due to the expiration of a non-affiliate PPA in 2021.Wholesale revenues from sales to non-affiliates consist of PPAs and short-term opportunity sales. Wholesale revenues from PPAs have both capacity and energy components. Wholesale capacity revenues from PPAs are recognized in amounts billable under the contract terms and provide for recovery of fixed costs and a return on investment. Wholesale revenues from sales to non-affiliates will vary depending on fuel prices, the market prices of wholesale energy compared to the cost of Georgia Power's and the Southern Company system's generation, demand for energy within the Southern Company system's electric service territory, and the availability of the Southern Company system's generation. Increases and decreases in energy revenues that are driven by fuel prices are accompanied by an increase or decrease in fuel costs and do not have a significant impact on net income. Short-term opportunity sales are made at market-based rates that generally provide a margin above Georgia Power's variable cost of energy.Wholesale revenues from sales to affiliated companies will vary depending on demand and the availability and cost of generating resources at each company. These affiliate sales are made in accordance with the IIC, as approved by the FERC. These transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings since this energy is generally sold at marginal cost.In 2022, other operating revenues decreased $28 million, or 4.8%, as compared to 2021 primarily due to a decrease of $32 million resulting from the termination of a transmission service contract, an increase of $18 million in realized losses associated with price stability products for retail customers on variable demand-driven pricing tariffs, and decreases of $17 million from retail solar programs as a result of higher avoided cost credits to customers and $16 million from power delivery construction and maintenance contracts. These reductions were largely offset by increases of $27 million associated with unregulated outdoor lighting sales and energy conservation projects, $20 million in open access transmission tariff sales, and $4 million from maintenance services provided to integrated transmission system owners.Energy SalesChanges in revenues are influenced heavily by the change in the volume of energy sold from year to year. KWH sales for 2022 and the percent change from 2021 were as follows:2022TotalKWHsTotal KWHPercent ChangeWeather-AdjustedPercent Change(*)(in billions)Residential29.1 4.4 %0.4 %Commercial32.6 3.9 2.9 Industrial23.9 2.5 2.4 Other0.4 (3.0)(2.9)Total retail86.0 3.6 1.9 %Wholesale2.4 (23.0)Total energy sales88.4 2.6 %(*)Weather-adjusted KWH sales are estimated using statistical models of the historical relationship between temperatures and energy sales, and then removing the estimated effect of deviations from normal temperature conditions. Normal temperature conditions are defined as those experienced in Georgia Power's service territory over a specified historical period. This metric is useful because it allows trends in historical operations to be evaluated apart from the influence of weather conditions. Management also considers this metric in developing long-term capital and financial plans.Changes in retail energy sales are generally the result of changes in electricity usage by customers, weather, and the number of customers. Revenues attributable to changes in sales increased in 2022 when compared to 2021. Weather-adjusted residential and commercial KWH sales increased 0.4% and 2.9%, respectively, in 2022 when compared to 2021 primarily due to customer II-23 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISgrowth. In addition, commercial customer usage increased and residential customer usage decreased in 2022 when compared to 2021 as customers returned to pre-pandemic levels of activity outside the home. Weather-adjusted industrial KWH sales increased 2.4% primarily due to increases in the pipeline, lumber, paper, and electronic sectors, partially offset by decreases in the textiles and chemicals sectors.See ""Operating Revenues"" above for a discussion of significant changes in wholesale sales to non-affiliates and affiliated companies.Fuel and Purchased Power ExpensesFuel costs constitute one of the largest expenses for Georgia Power. The mix of fuel sources for the generation of electricity is determined primarily by demand, the unit cost of fuel consumed, and the availability of generating units. Additionally, Georgia Power purchases a portion of its electricity needs from the wholesale market.Details of Georgia Power's generation and purchased power were as follows:20222021Total generation (in billions of KWHs)59.758.1 Total purchased power (in billions of KWHs)33.631.7 Sources of generation (percent) —Gas48 48 Nuclear27 28 Coal21 20 Hydro and other4 4 Cost of fuel, generated (in cents per net KWH) —Gas5.06 3.05 Nuclear0.75 0.79 Coal4.12 2.99 Average cost of fuel, generated (in cents per net KWH)3.64 2.39 Average cost of purchased power (in cents per net KWH)(*)7.88 5.07 (*) Average cost of purchased power includes fuel purchased by Georgia Power for tolling agreements where power is generated by the provider.Fuel and purchased power expenses were $4.7 billion in 2022, an increase of $1.8 billion, or 61.3%, compared to 2021. The increase was due to an increase of $1.7 billion related to the average cost of fuel and purchased power and an increase of $148 million related to the volume of KWHs generated and purchased.Fuel and purchased power energy transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings since these fuel expenses are generally offset by fuel revenues through Georgia Power's fuel cost recovery mechanism. See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Georgia Power – Fuel Cost Recovery"" for additional information.FuelFuel expense was $2.5 billion in 2022, an increase of $1.0 billion, or 71.6%, compared to 2021. The increase was primarily due to increases of 65.9% and 37.8% in the average cost per KWH generated by natural gas and coal, respectively, and a 10.8% increase in the volume of KWHs generated by coal.Purchased Power - Non-AffiliatesPurchased power expense from non-affiliates was $856 million in 2022, an increase of $224 million, or 35.4%, compared to 2021. The increase was primarily due to an increase of 26.5% in the average cost per KWH purchased primarily due to higher natural gas and coal prices and an increase of 25.4% in the volume of KWHs purchased primarily due to higher demand.Energy purchases from non-affiliates will vary depending on the market prices of wholesale energy as compared to the cost of the Southern Company system's generation, demand for energy within the Southern Company system's electric service territory, and the availability of the Southern Company system's generation.II-24 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISPurchased Power - AffiliatesPurchased power expense from affiliates was $1.4 billion in 2022, an increase of $542 million, or 63.1%, compared to 2021. The increase was primarily due to an increase of 75.3% in the average cost per KWH purchased primarily due to higher natural gas and coal prices.Energy purchases from affiliates will vary depending on the demand and the availability and cost of generating resources at each company within the Southern Company system. These purchases are made in accordance with the IIC or other contractual agreements, all as approved by the FERC.Other Operations and Maintenance ExpensesOther operations and maintenance expenses increased $136 million, or 6.1%, in 2022 as compared to 2021. The increase was primarily due to increases of $96 million in distribution expenses primarily associated with line maintenance, $45 million in certain compensation and benefit expenses, $11 million in amortization of cloud software, and $9 million in maintenance costs at corporate and field support facilities, partially offset by $17 million in gains from sales of integrated transmission system assets, a decrease of $15 million in generation expenses primarily related to scheduled generation outages partially offset by environmental projects, and a $12 million reduction in billing adjustments with integrated transmission system owners largely resulting from a terminated transmission service agreement.Depreciation and AmortizationDepreciation and amortization increased $59 million, or 4.3%, in 2022 as compared to 2021 primarily due to increases of $46 million associated with additional plant in service and $12 million associated with amortization of regulatory assets related to CCR AROs under the terms of the 2019 ARP. See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Georgia Power – Integrated Resource Plans"" and "" – Rate Plans – 2019 ARP"" for additional information.Taxes Other Than Income TaxesTaxes other than income taxes increased $51 million, or 10.7%, in 2022 as compared to 2021 primarily due to an increase in municipal franchise fees resulting from higher retail revenues.Estimated Loss on Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4Georgia Power recorded pre-tax charges to income for the estimated probable loss on Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 totaling $183 million and $1.7 billion in 2022 and 2021, respectively. The charges to income in each year were recorded to reflect revisions to the total project capital cost forecast to complete construction and start-up of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Georgia Power – Nuclear Construction"" for additional information.Allowance for Equity Funds Used During ConstructionAllowance for equity funds used during construction increased $13 million, or 10.2%, in 2022 as compared to 2021 primarily due to an increase in capital expenditures subject to AFUDC.Interest Expense, Net of Amounts CapitalizedInterest expense, net of amounts capitalized increased $64 million, or 15.2%, in 2022 as compared to 2021. The increase primarily reflects approximately $39 million related to higher average outstanding borrowings and $24 million related to higher interest rates. See FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY – ""Sources of Capital"" and ""Financing Activities"" herein and Note 8 to the financial statements for additional information.Other Income (Expense), NetOther income (expense), net increased $34 million, or 23.9%, in 2022 as compared to 2021 primarily due to an increase in non-service cost-related retirement benefits income. See Note 11 to the financial statements for additional information on Georgia Power's net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit costs.Income Taxes (Benefit)In 2022, income tax expense was $370 million compared to income tax benefit of $168 million for 2021, a change of $538 million. The change was primarily due to higher pre-tax earnings largely resulting from a decrease in charges associated with the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 and an increase in a valuation allowance and other adjustments related to certain state tax credit carryforwards. See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Georgia Power – Nuclear Construction"" and Note 10 to the financial statements for additional information.II-25 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISMississippi PowerMississippi Power's net income was $164 million in 2022 compared to $159 million in 2021.

See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Mississippi Power"" for additional information.See ""Energy Sales"" below for a discussion of changes in the volume of energy sold, including changes related to sales and weather.Electric rates for Mississippi Power include provisions to adjust billings for fluctuations in fuel costs, including the energy component of purchased power costs. Under these provisions, fuel revenues generally equal fuel expenses, including the energy component of purchased power costs, and do not affect net income. Recoverable fuel costs include fuel and purchased power II-26 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISexpenses reduced by the fuel and emissions portion of wholesale revenues from energy sold to customers outside Mississippi Power's service territory. See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Mississippi Power – Fuel Cost Recovery"" for additional information.Wholesale revenues from power sales to non-affiliated utilities, including FERC-regulated MRA sales as well as market-based sales, were as follows:20222021(in millions)Capacity and other$3 $3 Energy249 227 Total non-affiliated$252 $230 Wholesale revenues from sales to non-affiliates increased $22 million, or 9.6%, compared to 2021. The increase was primarily due to higher fuel costs and an increase in base revenue from MRA customers primarily due to increased demand as a result of weather impacts in 2022.Wholesale revenues from sales to non-affiliates will vary depending on fuel prices, the market prices of wholesale energy compared to the cost of Mississippi Power's and the Southern Company system's generation, demand for energy within the Southern Company system's electric service territory, and the availability of the Southern Company system's generation. Increases and decreases in energy revenues that are driven by fuel prices are accompanied by an increase or decrease in fuel costs and do not have a significant impact on net income. In addition, Mississippi Power provides service under long-term contracts with rural electric cooperative associations and a municipality located in southeastern Mississippi under requirements cost-based electric tariffs which are subject to regulation by the FERC. The contracts with these wholesale customers represented 12.4% of Mississippi Power's total operating revenues in 2022. Historically, these wholesale customers have acted as a group and any changes in contractual relationships for one customer are likely to be followed by the other wholesale customers. Short-term opportunity energy sales are also included in sales for resale to non-affiliates. These opportunity sales are made at market-based rates that generally provide a margin above Mississippi Power's variable cost to produce the energy. See Note 2 under ""Mississippi Power – Municipal and Rural Associations Tariff"" for additional information.Wholesale revenues from sales to affiliates increased $272 million, or 144.7%, in 2022 compared to 2021. The increase was primarily due to increases of $243 million associated with higher fuel costs, primarily for natural gas, and $29 million associated with higher KWH sales due to lower cost available Mississippi Power resources as compared to the available affiliate company generation.Wholesale revenues from sales to affiliates will vary depending on demand and the availability and cost of generating resources at each company. These affiliate sales are made in accordance with the IIC, as approved by the FERC. These transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings since this energy is generally sold at marginal cost.In 2022, other operating revenues increased $18 million, or 62.1%, as compared to 2021 primarily due to increases of $13 million in unregulated sales associated with power delivery construction and maintenance projects and $4 million in open access transmission tariff revenues.II-27 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISEnergy SalesChanges in revenues are influenced heavily by the change in the volume of energy sold from year to year. KWH sales for 2022 and the percent change from 2021 were as follows:2022TotalKWHsTotal KWHPercent ChangeWeather-Adjusted Percent Change(*)(in millions)Residential2,134 4.2 %(1.8)%Commercial2,632 2.9 1.4 Industrial4,686 1.6 1.6 Other31 (8.8)(8.8)Total retail9,483 2.5 %0.7 %WholesaleNon-affiliated3,465 (4.0)Affiliated5,489 15.8 Total wholesale8,954 7.2 Total energy sales18,437 4.7 %(*)Weather-adjusted KWH sales are estimated using statistical models of the historical relationship between temperatures and energy sales, and then removing the estimated effect of deviations from normal temperature conditions. Normal temperature conditions are defined as those experienced in Mississippi Power's service territory over a specified historical period. This metric is useful because it allows trends in historical operations to be evaluated apart from the influence of weather conditions. Management also considers this metric in developing long-term capital and financial plans.Changes in retail energy sales are generally the result of changes in electricity usage by customers, weather, and the number of customers. Revenues attributable to changes in sales increased in 2022 when compared to 2021. Weather-adjusted residential KWH sales decreased 1.8% compared to 2021 due to a decrease in customer usage resulting from increased activity outside the home as customers returned to pre-pandemic levels of activity. Weather-adjusted commercial KWH sales increased 1.4% primarily due to customer growth. Industrial KWH sales increased 1.6% primarily due to increases in the petroleum, pipeline, and transportation sectors.See ""Operating Revenues"" above for a discussion of significant changes in wholesale revenues to affiliated companies.Fuel and Purchased Power ExpensesThe mix of fuel sources for generation of electricity is determined primarily by demand, the unit cost of fuel consumed, and the availability of generating units. Additionally, Mississippi Power purchases a portion of its electricity needs from the wholesale market.Details of Mississippi Power's generation and purchased power were as follows:20222021Total generation (in millions of KWHs)18,303 17,377 Total purchased power (in millions of KWHs)617 675 Sources of generation (percent) –Gas90 92 Coal10 8 Cost of fuel, generated (in cents per net KWH) –Gas4.34 2.85 Coal4.13 3.24 Average cost of fuel, generated (in cents per net KWH)4.31 2.88 Average cost of purchased power (in cents per net KWH)6.91 3.90 Fuel and purchased power expenses were $789 million in 2022, an increase of $293 million, or 59.1%, as compared to 2021. The increase was primarily due to a $266 million increase related to the average cost of fuel and purchased power and a $27 million net increase related to the volume of KWHs generated and purchased.II-28 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISFuel and purchased power energy transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings since energy expenses are generally offset by energy revenues through Mississippi Power's fuel cost recovery clauses. See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Mississippi Power – Fuel Cost Recovery"" and Note 1 to the financial statements under ""Fuel Costs"" for additional information.Fuel expense increased $276 million, or 58.8%, in 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to a 52.3% increase in the average cost of natural gas per KWH generated, a 29.1% increase in the volume of KWHs generated by coal, a 27.5% increase in the average cost of coal per KWHs generated, and a 3.9% increase in the volume of KWHs generated by natural gas.Purchased power expense increased $16 million, or 62.0%, in 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to a 77.2% increase in the average cost per KWH purchased, partially offset by an 8.6% decrease in the volume of KWHs purchased.Energy purchases will vary depending on the market prices of wholesale energy as compared to the cost of the Southern Company system's generation, demand for energy within the Southern Company system's service territory, and the availability of the Southern Company system's generation. These purchases are made in accordance with the IIC or other contractual agreements, as approved by the FERC.Other Operations and Maintenance ExpensesOther operations and maintenance expenses increased $63 million, or 20.1%, in 2022 compared to 2021. The increase was primarily due to a $25 million reliability reserve accrual in 2022 and increases of $12 million related to unregulated power delivery construction and maintenance projects, $7 million associated with storm reserve accruals, $6 million in employee compensation and benefits, $4 million in transmission and distribution line maintenance, and $4 million associated with the Kemper County energy facility primarily related to sales and use taxes. See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Mississippi Power – System Restoration Rider"" and "" – Reliability Reserve Accounting Order"" and Note 3 to the financial statements under ""Other Matters – Mississippi Power"" for additional information.Income TaxesIncome taxes increased $16 million, or 76.2%, in 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to an increase of $11 million in the flowback of excess deferred income taxes associated with new PEP rates that became effective in April 2022, as well as an increase of $5 million due to higher pre-tax earnings. See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Mississippi Power – Performance Evaluation Plan"" and Note 10 to the financial statements for additional information.II-29 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISSouthern PowerNet income attributable to Southern Power for 2022 was $354 million, an $88 million increase from 2021. The increase was primarily due to higher revenues driven by higher market prices of energy and new natural gas PPAs and higher income associated with tax equity partnerships, partially offset by higher other operations and maintenance expenses, gains from contributions of wind turbine equipment to various equity method investments in 2021, and a tax benefit due to a change in state apportionment methodology resulting from tax legislation enacted by the State of Alabama in 2021.A condensed statement of income follows:2022Increase(Decrease)from 2021(in millions)Operating revenues$3,369 $1,153 Fuel1,614 812 Purchased power311 172 Other operations and maintenance482 59 Depreciation and amortization516 (1)Taxes other than income taxes49 4 Loss on sales-type leases1 (39)Gain on dispositions, net(2)39 Total operating expenses2,971 1,046 Operating income398 107 Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized138 (9)Other income (expense), net7 (3)Income taxes (benefit)20 33 Net income247 80 Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests(107)(8)Net income attributable to Southern Power$354 $88 Operating RevenuesTotal operating revenues include PPA capacity revenues, which are derived primarily from long-term contracts involving natural gas facilities, and PPA energy revenues from Southern Power's generation facilities. To the extent Southern Power has capacity not contracted under a PPA, it may sell power into an accessible wholesale market, or, to the extent those generation assets are part of the FERC-approved IIC, it may sell power into the Southern Company power pool.Natural Gas Capacity and Energy RevenueCapacity revenues generally represent the greatest contribution to operating income and are designed to provide recovery of fixed costs plus a return on investment.Energy is generally sold at variable cost or is indexed to published natural gas indices. Energy revenues will vary depending on the energy demand of Southern Power's customers and their generation capacity, as well as the market prices of wholesale energy compared to the cost of Southern Power's energy. Energy revenues also include fees for support services, fuel storage, and unit start charges. Increases and decreases in energy revenues under PPAs that are driven by fuel or purchased power prices are generally accompanied by an increase or decrease in fuel and purchased power costs and do not have a significant impact on net income.Solar and Wind Energy RevenueSouthern Power's energy sales from solar and wind generating facilities are predominantly through long-term PPAs that do not have capacity revenue. Customers either purchase the energy output of a dedicated renewable facility through an energy charge or pay a fixed price related to the energy generated from the respective facility and sold to the grid. As a result, Southern Power's ability to recover fixed and variable operations and maintenance expenses is dependent upon the level of energy generated from these facilities, which can be impacted by weather conditions, equipment performance, transmission constraints, and other factors. II-30 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISSee FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – ""Southern Power's Power Sales Agreements"" herein for additional information regarding Southern Power's PPAs.Operating Revenues DetailsDetails of Southern Power's operating revenues were as follows:20222021(in millions)PPA capacity revenues $451 $408 PPA energy revenues 2,121 1,311 Total PPA revenues2,572 1,719 Non-PPA revenues 761 467 Other revenues36 30 Total operating revenues$3,369 $2,216 Operating revenues for 2022 were $3.4 billion, a $1.2 billion, or 52.0% increase from 2021. The increase in operating revenues was primarily due to the following:•PPA capacity revenues increased $43 million, or 10.5%, primarily due to a net increase in MW capacity under contract from natural gas PPAs and an increase associated with a change in rates from natural gas PPAs.•PPA energy revenues increased $810 million, or 61.8%, primarily due to a $656 million increase in sales under existing natural gas PPAs resulting from a $539 million increase in the price of fuel and purchased power and a $117 million increase in the volume of KWHs sold. Also contributing to the increase was a $164 million increase in sales associated with new natural gas PPAs, net of contractual expirations.•Non-PPA revenues increased $294 million, or 63.0%, due to a $338 million increase in the market price of energy, partially offset by a $42 million decrease in the volume of KWHs sold through short-term sales.Fuel and Purchased Power ExpensesDetails of Southern Power's generation and purchased power were as follows:TotalKWHsTotal KWH % ChangeTotalKWHs20222021(in billions of KWHs)Generation4844Purchased power33Total generation and purchased power518.5%47Total generation and purchased power (excluding solar, wind, fuel cells, and tolling agreements)3110.7%28Southern Power's PPAs for natural gas generation generally provide that the purchasers are responsible for either procuring the fuel (tolling agreements) or reimbursing Southern Power for substantially all of the cost of fuel relating to the energy delivered under such PPAs. Consequently, changes in such fuel costs are generally accompanied by a corresponding change in related fuel revenues and do not have a significant impact on net income. Southern Power is responsible for the cost of fuel for generating units that are not covered under PPAs. Power from these generating units is sold into the wholesale market or into the Southern Company power pool for capacity owned directly by Southern Power.Purchased power expenses will vary depending on demand, availability, and the cost of generating resources throughout the Southern Company system and other contract resources. Load requirements are submitted to the Southern Company power pool on an hourly basis and are fulfilled with the lowest cost alternative, whether that is generation owned by Southern Power, an affiliate company, or external parties. Such purchased power costs are generally recovered through PPA revenues.II-31 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISDetails of Southern Power's fuel and purchased power expenses were as follows:20222021(in millions)Fuel$1,614 $802 Purchased power311 139 Total fuel and purchased power expenses$1,925 $941 In 2022, total fuel and purchased power expenses increased $984 million, or 104.6%, compared to 2021. Fuel expense increased $812 million, or 101.2%, primarily due to a $719 million increase associated with the average cost of fuel and a $93 million increase associated with the volume of KWHs generated. Purchased power expense increased $172 million, or 123.7%, largely due to a $168 million increase associated with the average cost of purchased power.Other Operations and Maintenance ExpensesIn 2022, other operations and maintenance expenses increased $59 million, or 14.0%, compared to 2021. The increase was primarily due to increases of $42 million related to generation maintenance and outage expenses and $10 million in transmission expenses to serve new natural gas PPAs, partially offset by $6 million related to the allocation in 2021 of uncollected settlements by the Energy Reliability Council of Texas market as a result of Winter Storm Uri.Loss on Sales-Type LeasesIn 2021, a $40 million loss on sales-type leases was recorded upon commencement of the Garland and Tranquillity battery energy storage facilities' PPAs, $26 million of which was allocated through noncontrolling interests to Southern Power's partners in the projects. The loss was due to ITCs retained and expected to be realized by Southern Power and its partners. See Notes 9 and 15 to the financial statements under ""Lessor"" and ""Southern Power,"" respectively, for additional information.Gain on Dispositions, NetIn 2022, gain on dispositions, net decreased $39 million, or 95.1%, compared to 2021 primarily due to contributions of wind turbine equipment to various equity method investments in 2021. See Notes 7 and 15 to the financial statements under ""Southern Power"" for additional information.Income Taxes (Benefit)In 2022, income tax expense was $20 million compared to income tax benefit of $13 million for 2021, a change of $33 million. The change was primarily due to higher pre-tax earnings in 2022 and a change in state apportionment methodology resulting from tax legislation enacted by the State of Alabama in the first quarter 2021, partially offset by higher wind PTCs in 2022. See Notes 1 and 10 to the financial statements under ""Income Taxes"" and ""Effective Tax Rate,"" respectively, for additional information.Net Loss Attributable to Noncontrolling InterestsIn 2022, net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests increased $8 million, or 8.1%, compared to 2021. The increased loss was primarily due to $28 million in higher HLBV loss allocations to tax equity partners in 2022, largely offset by $23 million in loss allocations associated with the Garland and Tranquillity battery energy storage facilities being placed in service in 2021. See Notes 9 and 15 to the financial statements under ""Lessor"" and ""Southern Power,"" respectively, for additional information.Southern Company GasOperating MetricsSouthern Company Gas continues to focus on several operating metrics, including Heating Degree Days, customer count, and volumes of natural gas sold.Southern Company Gas measures weather and the effect on its business using Heating Degree Days. Generally, increased Heating Degree Days result in higher demand for natural gas on Southern Company Gas' distribution system. Southern Company Gas has various regulatory mechanisms, such as weather and revenue normalization and straight-fixed-variable rate design, which limit its exposure to weather changes within typical ranges in each of its utility's respective service territory. Southern Company Gas also utilizes weather hedges to limit the negative income impacts in the event of warmer-than-normal weather.The number of customers served by gas distribution operations and gas marketing services can be impacted by natural gas prices, economic conditions, and competition from alternative fuels. Gas distribution operations and gas marketing services' customers are primarily located in Georgia and Illinois.II-32 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISSouthern Company Gas' natural gas volume metrics for gas distribution operations and gas marketing services illustrate the effects of weather and customer demand for natural gas. Wholesale gas services' physical sales volumes represent the daily average natural gas volumes sold to its customers.Seasonality of ResultsDuring the Heating Season, natural gas usage and operating revenues are generally higher as more customers are connected to the gas distribution systems and natural gas usage is higher in periods of colder weather. Prior to the sale of Sequent on July 1, 2021, wholesale gas services' operating revenues occasionally were impacted due to peak usage by power generators in response to summer energy demands. Southern Company Gas' base operating expenses, excluding cost of natural gas, bad debt expense, and certain incentive compensation costs, are incurred relatively evenly throughout the year. Seasonality also affects the comparison of certain balance sheet items across quarters, including receivables, unbilled revenues, natural gas for sale, and notes payable. However, these items are comparable when reviewing Southern Company Gas' annual results. Thus, Southern Company Gas' operating results can vary significantly from quarter to quarter as a result of seasonality, which is illustrated in the table below.Percent Generated DuringHeating SeasonOperating RevenuesNetIncome202267 %66 %202170 %102 %Net IncomeNet income attributable to Southern Company Gas in 2022 was $572 million, an increase of $33 million, or 6.1%, compared to 2021. Net income increased $88 million at gas pipeline investments primarily as a result of a 2021 impairment charge related to the PennEast Pipeline project and $58 million at gas distribution operations primarily due to base rate increases and continued investment in infrastructure replacement, largely offset by after-tax impairment charges in 2022 totaling $99 million related to the sale of natural gas storage facilities. The 2021 results also included $107 million of net income from Sequent, including a $92 million after-tax gain and $85 million of additional tax expense resulting from its July 1, 2021 sale.

See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Southern Company Gas"" for additional information.Revenues associated with gas costs and other cost recovery increased in 2022 primarily due to higher natural gas cost recovery as a result of higher volumes of natural gas sold and an increase in natural gas prices. The natural gas distribution utilities have weather or revenue normalization mechanisms that mitigate revenue fluctuations from customer consumption changes. Natural gas distribution rates include provisions to adjust billings for fluctuations in natural gas costs. Therefore, gas costs recovered through natural gas revenues generally equal the amount expensed in cost of natural gas and do not affect net income from gas distribution operations. See ""Cost of Natural Gas"" herein for additional information.The changes in 2022 revenues related to wholesale gas services were due to the sale of Sequent on July 1, 2021. See Note 15 to the financial statements under ""Southern Company Gas"" for additional information.Heating Degree DaysSouthern Company Gas' natural gas distribution utilities have various regulatory mechanisms that limit their exposure to weather changes. Southern Company Gas also uses hedges for the majority of any remaining exposure to warmer-than-normal weather in Illinois for gas distribution operations and in Illinois and Georgia for gas marketing services; therefore, weather typically does not have a significant net income impact. The following table presents Heating Degree Days information for Illinois and Georgia, the primary locations where Southern Company Gas' operations are impacted by weather.Years Ended December 31,2022 vs. normal2022 vs. 2021Normal(*)20222021coldercolder(in thousands)Illinois5,690 5,708 5,326 0.3 %7.2 %Georgia2,303 2,303 2,113 — %9.0 %(*)Normal represents the 10-year average from January 1, 2012 through December 31, 2021 for Illinois at Chicago Midway International Airport and for Georgia at Atlanta Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport, based on information obtained from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, National Climatic Data Center.II-34 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISCustomer Count The following table provides the number of customers served by Southern Company Gas at December 31, 2022 and 2021:20222021(in thousands, except market share %)Gas distribution operations4,358 4,337 Gas marketing servicesEnergy customers(*)622 603 Market share of energy customers in Georgia29.3 %28.7 %(*)Gas marketing services' customers are primarily located in Georgia and Illinois.Southern Company Gas anticipates customer growth and uses a variety of targeted marketing programs to attract new customers and to retain existing customers.Cost of Natural Gas Excluding Atlanta Gas Light, which does not sell natural gas to end-use customers, natural gas distribution rates include provisions to adjust billings for fluctuations in natural gas costs. Therefore, gas costs recovered through natural gas revenues generally equal the amount expensed in cost of natural gas and do not affect net income from gas distribution operations. See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Southern Company Gas – Natural Gas Cost Recovery"" for additional information. Cost of natural gas at gas distribution operations represented 87.5% of the total cost of natural gas for 2022.Gas marketing services customers are charged for actual and estimated natural gas consumed. Cost of natural gas includes the cost of fuel and associated transportation costs, lost and unaccounted for gas, adjustments to reduce the value of inventories to market value, if applicable, and gains and losses associated with certain derivatives.In 2022, cost of natural gas was $3.0 billion, an increase of $1.4 billion, or 85.5%, compared to 2021, which reflects higher gas cost recovery in 2022 as a result of higher volumes sold and a 73.0% increase in natural gas prices compared to 2021.Volumes of Natural Gas SoldThe following table details the volumes of natural gas sold during all periods presented.2022 vs. 202120222021% ChangeGas distribution operations (mmBtu in millions)Firm707 656 7.8 %Interruptible93 98 (5.1)Total800 754 6.1 %Gas marketing services (mmBtu in millions)Firm:Georgia35 34 2.9 %Other 18 18 — Interruptible large commercial and industrial14 14 — Total67 66 1.5 %Other Operations and Maintenance ExpensesIn 2022, other operations and maintenance expenses increased $104 million, or 9.7%, compared to 2021. Excluding $66 million of expenses related to Sequent in 2021, other operations and maintenance expenses increased approximately $174 million. The increase was primarily due to increases of $64 million in compensation and benefit expenses, $43 million in expenses passed through directly to customers primarily related to bad debt at gas distribution operations, $31 million primarily related to bad debt, customer service, and sales expenses, and $18 million primarily related to pipeline compliance.II-35 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISDepreciation and AmortizationIn 2022, depreciation and amortization increased $23 million, or 4.3%, compared to 2021. The increase was primarily due to continued infrastructure investments at the natural gas distribution utilities. See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Southern Company Gas – Infrastructure Replacement Programs and Capital Projects"" for additional information.Taxes Other Than Income TaxesIn 2022, taxes other than income taxes increased $57 million, or 25.3%, compared to 2021. The increase was primarily due to a $39 million increase in revenue tax expenses as a result of higher natural gas revenues and an $11 million increase in invested capital tax expense at Nicor Gas. Revenue tax expenses are passed through directly to customers and have no impact on net income.Impairment ChargesIn 2022, Southern Company Gas recorded pre-tax impairment charges totaling approximately $131 million ($99 million after tax) as a result of an agreement to sell two natural gas storage facilities. See Note 15 to the financial statements under ""Southern Company Gas"" for additional information.Gain on Dispositions, NetIn 2021, Southern Company Gas recorded a $121 million gain on the sale of Sequent. See Note 15 to the financial statements under ""Southern Company Gas"" for additional information.Earnings from Equity Method InvestmentsIn 2022, earnings from equity method investments increased $98 million compared to 2021. The increase was primarily due to pre-tax impairment charges totaling $84 million in 2021 related to the PennEast Pipeline project and higher earnings at SNG resulting from higher revenues primarily due to increased demand. See Note 7 to the financial statements under ""Southern Company Gas"" for additional information.Interest Expense, Net of Amounts CapitalizedIn 2022, interest expense, net of amounts capitalized increased $25 million, or 10.5%, compared to 2021. The increase reflects approximately $16 million related to higher average outstanding borrowings and $8 million related to higher interest rates. See Note 8 to the financial statements for additional information.Other Income (Expense), NetIn 2022, other income (expense), net increased $106 million compared to 2021. The increase was largely due to charitable contributions by Sequent prior to its sale totaling $101 million in 2021 and an increase of $10 million at gas distribution operations primarily related to non-service cost-related retirement benefits income. See Note 11 to the financial statements under ""Southern Company Gas"" for additional information.Income TaxesIn 2022, income taxes decreased $95 million, or 34.5%, compared to 2021. The decrease was primarily due to additional tax benefit of $110 million resulting from the sale of Sequent in 2021 and $32 million as a result of the impairment related to the agreement to sell two natural gas storage facilities in 2022. The decrease was partially offset by $17 million of tax benefits in 2021 resulting from the impairment charge related to the PennEast Pipeline project and higher pre-tax earnings in 2022. See Notes 7 and 15 to the financial statements under ""Southern Company Gas"" and Note 10 to the financial statements for additional information.II-36 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISSegment Information20222021Operating RevenuesOperating ExpensesNet Income (Loss)Operating RevenuesOperating ExpensesNet Income (Loss)(in millions)(in millions)Gas distribution operations$5,267 $4,464 $470 $3,679 $2,971 $412 Gas pipeline investments32 11 107 32 11 19 Wholesale gas services(*)— — — 188 (53)107 Gas marketing services638 505 94 475 350 88 All other55 190 (99)38 78 (87)Intercompany eliminations(30)(22)— (32)(32)— Consolidated$5,962 $5,148 $572 $4,380 $3,325 $539 (*)As a result of the sale of Sequent, wholesale gas services was no longer a reportable segment in 2022. See Note 15 to the financial statements under ""Southern Company Gas"" for additional information.Gas Distribution OperationsGas distribution operations is the largest component of Southern Company Gas' business and is subject to regulation and oversight by regulatory agencies in each of the states it serves. These agencies approve natural gas rates designed to provide Southern Company Gas with the opportunity to generate revenues to recover the cost of natural gas delivered to its customers and its fixed and variable costs, including depreciation, interest expense, operations and maintenance, taxes, and overhead costs, and to earn a reasonable return on its investments.With the exception of Atlanta Gas Light, Southern Company Gas' second largest utility that operates in a deregulated natural gas market and has a straight-fixed-variable rate design that minimizes the variability of its revenues based on consumption, the earnings of the natural gas distribution utilities can be affected by customer consumption patterns that are a function of weather conditions, price levels for natural gas, and general economic conditions that may impact customers' ability to pay for natural gas consumed. Southern Company Gas has various regulatory and other mechanisms, such as weather and revenue normalization mechanisms and weather derivative instruments, that limit its exposure to changes in customer consumption, including weather changes within typical ranges in its natural gas distribution utilities' service territories. See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Southern Company Gas"" for additional information.In 2022, net income increased $58 million, or 14.1%, compared to 2021. Operating revenues increased $1.6 billion primarily due to higher gas cost recovery, rate increases, and continued investment in infrastructure replacement. Gas costs recovered through natural gas revenues generally equal the amount expensed in cost of natural gas. Operating expenses increased $1.5 billion primarily due to a $1.2 billion increase in cost of gas as a result of higher natural gas prices compared to 2021, a $52 million increase in compensation and benefit expenses, and a $34 million increase in depreciation resulting from additional assets placed in service. The increase in operating expenses also includes increases of $83 million in costs passed through directly to customers primarily related to bad debt expenses and revenue taxes. Other income and expense increased $10 million primarily due to an increase in non-service cost-related retirement benefits income. Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized increased $22 million primarily due to additional debt issued to finance continued investments. Income taxes increased $25 million primarily due to higher pre-tax earnings. See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Southern Company Gas"" and Note 11 to the financial statements for additional information.Gas Pipeline InvestmentsGas pipeline investments consists primarily of joint ventures in natural gas pipeline investments including SNG, Dalton Pipeline, and PennEast Pipeline. In 2022, net income increased $88 million compared to 2021. The increase was primarily due to impairment charges in 2021 totaling $84 million ($67 million after tax) related to the PennEast Pipeline project and higher earnings at SNG resulting from higher revenues primarily due to increased demand. See Note 7 to the financial statements under ""Southern Company Gas"" for additional information.Gas Marketing ServicesGas marketing services provides energy-related products and services to natural gas markets and participants in customer choice programs that were approved in various states to increase competition. These programs allow customers to choose their natural gas supplier while the local distribution utility continues to provide distribution and transportation services. Gas marketing II-37 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISservices is weather sensitive and uses a variety of hedging strategies, such as weather derivative instruments and other risk management tools, to partially mitigate potential weather impacts.In 2022, net income increased $6 million, or 6.8%, compared to 2021. The increase was primarily due to a $163 million increase in operating revenues as a result of higher commodity prices, colder weather, and higher sales to commercial customers, partially offset by a $155 million increase in operating expenses primarily due to $149 million in higher cost of natural gas and an increase of $3 million in income taxes as a result of higher pre-tax earnings.All OtherAll other includes natural gas storage businesses, a renewable natural gas business, AGL Services Company, and Southern Company Gas Capital, as well as various corporate operating expenses that are not allocated to the reportable segments and interest income (expense) associated with affiliate financing arrangements. See Note 15 to the financial statements under ""Southern Company Gas"" for information regarding agreements by certain affiliates of Southern Company Gas to sell two natural gas storage facilities.In 2022, net income decreased $12 million compared to 2021. The decrease was primarily due to pre-tax impairment charges in 2022 totaling approximately $131 million ($99 million after tax) related to the sale of natural gas storage facilities, largely offset by $84 million of additional tax expense as a result of the sale of Sequent in 2021, an increase in operating revenues of $17 million primarily related to higher demand fees and favorable hedge gains at the natural gas storage businesses and higher sales from the renewable natural gas business, lower depreciation in 2022, and an increase in charitable contributions in 2022. See Note 10 to the financial statements and Note 15 to the financial statements under ""Southern Company Gas"" for additional information.FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIALGeneralPrices for electric service provided by the traditional electric operating companies and natural gas distribution service provided by the natural gas distribution utilities to retail customers are set by state PSCs or other applicable state regulatory agencies under cost-based regulatory principles. Retail rates and earnings are reviewed through various regulatory mechanisms and/or processes and may be adjusted periodically within certain limitations. Effectively operating pursuant to these regulatory mechanisms and/or processes and appropriately balancing required costs and capital expenditures with customer prices will continue to challenge the traditional electric operating companies and natural gas distribution utilities for the foreseeable future. Prices for wholesale electricity sales, interconnecting transmission lines, and the exchange of electric power are regulated by the FERC. Southern Power continues to focus on long-term PPAs. See ACCOUNTING POLICIES – ""Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – Utility Regulation"" herein and Note 2 to the financial statements for additional information about regulatory matters.Each Registrant's results of operations are not necessarily indicative of its future earnings potential. The disposition activities described in Note 15 to the financial statements have reduced earnings for the applicable Registrants. The level of the Registrants' future earnings depends on numerous factors that affect the opportunities, challenges, and risks of the Registrants' primary businesses of selling electricity and/or distributing natural gas, as described further herein.For the traditional electric operating companies, these factors include the ability to maintain constructive regulatory environments that allow for the timely recovery of prudently-incurred costs during a time of increasing costs, including those related to projected long-term demand growth, stringent environmental standards, including CCR rules, safety, system reliability and resiliency, fuel, restoration following major storms, and capital expenditures, including constructing new electric generating plants and expanding and improving the transmission and distribution systems; continued customer growth; and the trends of higher inflation and reduced electricity usage per customer, especially in residential and commercial markets. For Georgia Power, completing construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 and the related cost recovery proceedings is another major factor.Earnings in the electricity business will also depend upon maintaining and growing sales, considering, among other things, the adoption and/or penetration rates of increasingly energy-efficient technologies and increasing volumes of electronic commerce transactions, which could contribute to a net reduction in customer usage.Global and U.S. economic conditions continue to be significantly affected by a series of demand and supply shocks that caused a global and national economic recession in 2020 and have been further impacted by the invasion of Ukraine and significant declines in labor force participation rates. The confluence of these disruptions has resulted in the highest levels of inflation globally in 40 years and driven a significant policy response by central banks across the global economy. The U.S. Federal Reserve has increased policy interest rates faster than any rate increase cycle in the last 40 years and to levels high enough to slow economic activity. These actions and impacts, including increased costs for goods and services and borrowing costs, have led to a significantly increased risk of recession. Additionally, inflation remains elevated in part due to continued supply chain constraints and labor markets remaining tight. Electricity sales across all classes have recovered to pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels and II-38 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIScustomer growth at both the traditional electric operating companies and natural gas distribution utilities has remained strong. However, weakening economic activity increases the risk of slowing to declining energy sales. Additionally, the current economic environment has increased the uncertainty of future energy demand and operating costs. See RESULTS OF OPERATIONS herein for information on energy sales in the Southern Company system's service territory during 2022.The level of future earnings for Southern Power's competitive wholesale electric business depends on numerous factors including the parameters of the wholesale market and the efficient operation of its wholesale generating assets; Southern Power's ability to execute its growth strategy through the development or acquisition of renewable facilities and other energy projects while containing costs; regulatory matters; customer creditworthiness; total electric generating capacity available in Southern Power's market areas; Southern Power's ability to successfully remarket capacity as current contracts expire; renewable portfolio standards; continued availability of federal and state ITCs and PTCs, which could be impacted by future tax legislation; transmission constraints; cost of generation from units within the Southern Company power pool; and operational limitations. See ""Income Tax Matters"" herein for information regarding recent tax legislation expanding the availability of federal ITCs and PTCs. Also see Notes 10 and 15 to the financial statements for additional information.The level of future earnings for Southern Company Gas' primary business of distributing natural gas and its complementary businesses in the gas pipeline investments and gas marketing services sectors depends on numerous factors. These factors include the natural gas distribution utilities' ability to maintain constructive regulatory environments that allow for the timely recovery of prudently-incurred costs, including those related to projected long-term demand growth, safety, system reliability and resiliency, natural gas, and capital expenditures, including expanding and improving the natural gas distribution systems; the completion and subsequent operation of ongoing infrastructure and other construction projects; customer creditworthiness; and certain policies to limit the use of natural gas, such as the potential across certain parts of the U.S. for state or municipal bans on the use of natural gas or policies designed to promote electrification. The volatility of natural gas prices has an impact on Southern Company Gas' customer rates, its long-term competitive position against other energy sources, and the ability of Southern Company Gas' gas marketing services business to capture value from locational and seasonal spreads. Additionally, changes in commodity prices, primarily driven by tight gas supplies, geopolitical events, and diminished gas production, subject a portion of Southern Company Gas' operations to earnings variability and have resulted in higher natural gas prices. Additional economic factors may contribute to this environment. The demand for natural gas may increase, which may cause natural gas prices to rise and drive higher volatility in the natural gas markets on a longer-term basis. Alternatively, a significant drop in oil and natural gas prices could lead to a consolidation of natural gas producers or reduced levels of natural gas production.Earnings for both the electricity and natural gas businesses are subject to a variety of other factors. These factors include weather; competition; developing new and maintaining existing energy contracts and associated load requirements with wholesale customers; customer energy conservation practices; the use of alternative energy sources by customers; government incentives to reduce overall energy usage; fuel, labor, and material prices in an environment of heightened inflation and material and labor supply chain disruptions; and the price elasticity of demand. Demand for electricity and natural gas in the Registrants' service territories is primarily driven by the pace of economic growth or decline that may be affected by changes in regional and global economic conditions, which may impact future earnings.Mississippi Power provides service under long-term contracts with rural electric cooperative associations and a municipality located in southeastern Mississippi under requirements cost-based electric tariffs which are subject to regulation by the FERC. The contracts with these wholesale customers represented 12.4% of Mississippi Power's total operating revenues in 2022. Historically, these wholesale customers have acted as a group and any changes in contractual relationships for one customer are likely to be followed by the other wholesale customers.As part of its ongoing effort to adapt to changing market conditions, Southern Company continues to evaluate and consider a wide array of potential business strategies. These strategies may include business combinations, partnerships, and acquisitions involving other utility or non-utility businesses or properties, disposition of, or the sale of interests in, certain assets or businesses, internal restructuring, or some combination thereof. Furthermore, Southern Company may engage in new business ventures that arise from competitive and regulatory changes in the utility industry. Pursuit of any of the above strategies, or any combination thereof, may significantly affect the business operations, risks, and financial condition of Southern Company. In addition, Southern Power and Southern Company Gas regularly consider and evaluate joint development arrangements as well as acquisitions and dispositions of businesses and assets as part of their business strategies. See Note 15 to the financial statements for additional information.Environmental MattersThe Southern Company system's operations are regulated by state and federal environmental agencies through a variety of laws and regulations governing air, water, land, avian and other wildlife and habitat protection, and other natural resources. The Southern Company system maintains comprehensive environmental compliance and GHG strategies to assess both current and II-39 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISupcoming requirements and compliance costs associated with these environmental laws and regulations. New or revised environmental laws and regulations could further affect many areas of operations for the Subsidiary Registrants. The costs required to comply with environmental laws and regulations and to achieve stated goals, including capital expenditures, operations and maintenance costs, and costs reflected in ARO liabilities, may impact future electric generating unit retirement and replacement decisions (which are subject to approval from the traditional electric operating companies' respective state PSCs), results of operations, cash flows, and/or financial condition. Related costs may result from the installation of additional environmental controls, closure and monitoring of CCR facilities, unit retirements, or changing fuel sources for certain existing units, as well as related upgrades to the Southern Company system's transmission and distribution (electric and natural gas) systems. A major portion of these costs is expected to be recovered through retail and wholesale rates, including existing ratemaking and billing provisions. The ultimate impact of environmental laws and regulations and the GHG goals discussed herein cannot be determined at this time and will depend on various factors, such as state adoption and implementation of requirements, the availability and cost of any deployed technology, fuel prices, the outcome of pending and/or future legal challenges, and the ability to continue recovering the related costs, through rates for the traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities and/or through long-term wholesale agreements for the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power.Alabama Power and Mississippi Power recover environmental compliance costs through separate mechanisms, Rate CNP Compliance and the ECO Plan, respectively. Georgia Power's base rates include an ECCR tariff that allows for the recovery of environmental compliance costs. The natural gas distribution utilities of Southern Company Gas generally recover environmental remediation expenditures through rate mechanisms approved by their applicable state regulatory agencies. See Notes 2 and 3 to the financial statements for additional information.Southern Power's PPAs generally contain provisions that permit charging the counterparty for some of the new costs incurred as a result of changes in environmental laws and regulations. Since Southern Power's units are generally newer natural gas and renewable generating facilities, costs associated with environmental compliance for these facilities have been less significant than for similarly situated coal or older natural gas generating facilities. Environmental, natural resource, and land use concerns, including the applicability of air quality limitations, the potential presence of wetlands or threatened and endangered species, the availability of water withdrawal rights, uncertainties regarding impacts such as increased light or noise, and concerns about potential adverse health impacts can, however, increase the cost of siting and operating any type of future facility. The impact of such laws, regulations, and other considerations on Southern Power and subsequent recovery through PPA provisions cannot be determined at this time.Further, increased costs that are recovered through regulated rates could contribute to reduced demand for electricity and natural gas, which could negatively affect results of operations, cash flows, and/or financial condition. Additionally, many commercial and industrial customers may also be affected by existing and future environmental requirements, which may have the potential to affect their demand for electricity and natural gas.Although the timing, requirements, and estimated costs could change as environmental laws and regulations are adopted or modified, as compliance plans are revised or updated, and as legal challenges to rules are initiated or completed, estimated capital expenditures through 2027 based on the current environmental compliance strategy for the Southern Company system and the traditional electric operating companies are as follows:20232024202520262027Total(in millions)Southern Company$139 $125 $108 $91 $50 $513 Alabama Power53 35 46 28 18 180 Georgia Power82 86 56 53 24 301 Mississippi Power5 3 7 11 7 33 These estimates do not include any costs associated with potential regulation of GHG emissions. See ""Global Climate Issues"" herein for additional information. The Southern Company system also anticipates substantial expenditures associated with ash pond closure and groundwater monitoring under the CCR Rule and related state rules, which are reflected in the applicable Registrants' ARO liabilities. See FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY – ""Cash Requirements"" herein and Note 6 to the financial statements for additional information.II-40 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISEnvironmental Laws and RegulationsAir QualitySince 1990, the Southern Company system reduced SO2 and NOX air emissions by 99% and 92%, respectively, through 2021. Since 2005, the Southern Company system reduced mercury air emissions by 97% through 2021.On March 11, 2022, the EPA released a proposed Federal Implementation Plan to require reductions in NOX emissions from sources in 26 states, including Alabama and Mississippi, to assure those states satisfy their interstate transport (good neighbor) obligations under the 2015 Ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) in downwind states. Georgia and North Carolina have approved interstate transport state implementation plans related to the 2015 Ozone NAAQS and are not subject to this rule. The EPA is anticipated to issue a final rule by March 2023 with initial applicability for 2023. The ultimate impact of a final rule cannot be determined at this time; however, it may result in increased compliance costs.Water QualityIn 2020, the EPA published the final steam electric ELG reconsideration rule (ELG Reconsideration Rule), a reconsideration of the 2015 ELG rule's limits on bottom ash transport water and flue gas desulfurization wastewater that extended the latest applicability date for both discharges to December 31, 2025. The ELG Reconsideration Rule also updated the voluntary incentive program and provided new subcategories for low utilization electric generating units and electric generating units that will permanently cease coal combustion by 2028. As required by the ELG Reconsideration Rule, in October 2021, Alabama Power and Georgia Power each submitted initial notices of planned participation (NOPP) for applicable units seeking to qualify for these subcategories.Alabama Power submitted its NOPP to the Alabama Department of Environmental Management (ADEM) indicating plans to retire Plant Barry Unit 5 (700 MWs) and to cease using coal and begin operating solely on natural gas at Plant Barry Unit 4 (350 MWs) and Plant Gaston Unit 5 (880 MWs). Alabama Power, as agent for SEGCO, indicated plans to retire Plant Gaston Units 1 through 4 (1,000 MWs). These plans are expected to be completed on or before the compliance date of December 31, 2028. The NOPP submittals are subject to the review of the ADEM. With the completion of the Calhoun Generating Station acquisition on September 30, 2022, Alabama Power expects to retire Plant Barry Unit 5 in late 2023 or early 2024 subject to certain operating conditions. Plant Barry Unit 4 ceased using coal and began to operate solely on natural gas in December 2022. See Notes 2 and 7 to the financial statements under ""Alabama Power – Certificates of Convenience and Necessity"" and ""SEGCO,"" respectively, for additional information.The remaining assets for which Alabama Power has indicated retirement, due to early closure or repowering of the unit to natural gas, have net book values totaling approximately $1.4 billion (excluding capitalized asset retirement costs which are recovered through Rate CNP Compliance) at December 31, 2022. The net book value of $42 million for retired coal equipment at Plant Barry Unit 4 was reclassified to a regulatory asset at December 31, 2022. Based on an Alabama PSC order, Alabama Power is authorized to establish a regulatory asset to record the unrecovered investment costs, including the plant asset balance and the site removal and closure costs, associated with unit retirements caused by environmental regulations (Environmental Accounting Order). Under the Environmental Accounting Order, the regulatory asset would be amortized and recovered over an affected unit's remaining useful life, as established prior to the decision regarding early retirement, through Rate CNP Compliance. See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Alabama Power – Rate CNP Compliance"" and "" – Environmental Accounting Order"" for additional information.Georgia Power submitted its NOPP to the Georgia Environmental Protection Division (EPD) indicating plans to retire Plant Wansley Units 1 and 2 (926 MWs based on 53.5% ownership), Plant Bowen Units 1 and 2 (1,400 MWs), and Plant Scherer Unit 3 (614 MWs based on 75% ownership) on or before the compliance date of December 31, 2028. Georgia Power also submitted a NOPP indicating plans to pursue compliance with the ELG Reconsideration Rule for Plant Scherer Units 1 and 2 (137 MWs based on 8.4% ownership) through the voluntary incentive program by no later than December 31, 2028. Georgia Power intends to comply with the ELG Rules for Plant Bowen Units 3 and 4 through the generally applicable requirements by December 31, 2025; therefore, no NOPP submission was required for these units. The NOPP submittals and generally applicable requirements are subject to the review of the Georgia EPD.The Georgia PSC approved the retirements of Plant Wansley Units 1 and 2 (which occurred on August 31, 2022) and Plant Scherer Unit 3 in its 2022 IRP order, but deferred a decision on the requested decertification and retirement of Plant Bowen Units 1 and 2 to the 2025 IRP. See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Georgia Power – Integrated Resource Plans"" for additional information.II-41 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISThe ELG Reconsideration Rule has been challenged by several environmental organizations and the cases have been consolidated in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. The case is being held in abeyance while the EPA undertakes a new rulemaking to revise the ELG Reconsideration Rule. A proposed rule, referred to as the ELG Supplemental Rule, is expected to be released by mid-2023. Any revisions could require changes in the traditional electric operating companies' compliance strategies.The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.Coal Combustion ResidualsIn 2015, the EPA finalized non-hazardous solid waste regulations for the management and disposal of CCR, including coal ash and gypsum, in landfills and surface impoundments (ash ponds) at active electric generating power plants. The CCR Rule requires landfills and ash ponds to be evaluated against a set of performance criteria and potentially closed if certain criteria are not met. Closure of existing landfills and ash ponds requires installation of equipment and infrastructure to manage CCR in accordance with the CCR Rule. In addition to the federal CCR Rule, the States of Alabama and Georgia finalized state regulations regarding the management and disposal of CCR within their respective states. In 2019, the State of Georgia received partial approval from the EPA for its state CCR permitting program, which has broader applicability than the federal rule. The State of Mississippi has not developed a state CCR permit program.The Holistic Approach to Closure: Part A rule, finalized in 2020, revised the deadline to stop sending CCR and non-CCR wastes to unlined surface impoundments to April 11, 2021 and established a process for the EPA to approve extensions to the deadline. The traditional electric operating companies stopped sending CCR and non-CCR wastes to their unlined impoundments prior to April 11, 2021 and, therefore, did not submit requests for extensions. Beginning on January 11, 2022, the EPA has issued numerous Part A determinations that state its current positions on a variety of CCR Rule compliance requirements, such as criteria for groundwater corrective action and CCR unit closure. The traditional electric operating companies are working with state regulatory agencies to determine whether the EPA's current positions may impact closure and groundwater monitoring plans.On April 8, 2022, the Utilities Solid Waste Activities Group and a group of generating facility operators filed petitions for review in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit challenging whether the EPA's January 11, 2022 actions establish new legislative rules that should have gone through notice-and-comment rulemaking. A decision by the court is expected in late 2023. The ultimate impacts of the EPA's current positions are subject to the outcome of the pending litigation and any potential future rulemaking and cannot be determined at this time.Based on requirements for closure and monitoring of landfills and ash ponds pursuant to the CCR Rule and applicable state rules, the traditional electric operating companies have periodically updated, and expect to continue periodically updating, their related cost estimates and ARO liabilities for each CCR unit as additional information related to closure methodologies, schedules, and/or costs becomes available. Some of these updates have been, and future updates may be, material. Additionally, the closure designs and plans in the States of Alabama and Georgia are subject to approval by environmental regulatory agencies. Absent continued recovery of ARO costs through regulated rates, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition for Southern Company and the traditional electric operating companies could be materially impacted. See FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY – ""Cash Requirements,"" Notes 2 and 3 to the financial statements under ""Georgia Power – Rate Plans"" and ""General Litigation Matters – Alabama Power,"" respectively, and Note 6 to the financial statements for additional information.Environmental RemediationThe Southern Company system must comply with environmental laws and regulations governing the handling and disposal of waste and releases of hazardous substances. Under these various laws and regulations, the Southern Company system could incur substantial costs to clean up affected sites. The traditional electric operating companies and Southern Company Gas conduct studies to determine the extent of any required cleanup and have recognized the estimated costs to clean up known impacted sites in their financial statements. Amounts for cleanup and ongoing monitoring costs were not material for any year presented. The traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities in Illinois and Georgia (which represent substantially all of Southern Company Gas' accrued remediation costs) have all received authority from their respective state PSCs or other applicable state regulatory agencies to recover approved environmental remediation costs through regulatory mechanisms. These regulatory mechanisms are adjusted annually or as necessary within limits approved by the state PSCs or other applicable state regulatory agencies. The traditional electric operating companies and Southern Company Gas may be liable for some or all required cleanup costs for additional sites that may require environmental remediation. See Note 3 to the financial statements under ""Environmental Remediation"" for additional information.Global Climate IssuesIn 2019, the EPA published the final Affordable Clean Energy rule (ACE Rule), which repealed and replaced the Clean Power Plan (CPP) and would have required states to develop unit-specific CO2 emission rate standards for existing coal-fired units based on heat-rate efficiency improvements. On June 30, 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court issued an opinion limiting the EPA's authority II-42 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISto regulate GHG emissions under the Clean Air Act with a focus on whether such authority allows the EPA to regulate the electric industry in a manner as broad as the CPP. The EPA has announced its intent to propose a new rule for existing fossil fuel-fired electric generating units and to propose revised performance standards for new fossil fuel-fired electric generating units pursuant to the Clean Air Act by April 2023. The ultimate impact of these actions cannot be determined at this time.In February 2021, the United States officially rejoined the Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement establishes a non-binding universal framework for addressing GHG emissions based on nationally determined emissions reduction contributions and sets in place a process for tracking progress towards the goals every five years. In April 2021, President Biden announced a new target for the United States to achieve a 50% to 52% reduction in economy-wide GHG emissions from 2005 levels by 2030. The target was accepted by the United Nations as the United States' nationally determined emissions reduction contribution under the Paris Agreement.Additional GHG policies, including legislation, may emerge in the future requiring the United States to accelerate its transition to a lower GHG emitting economy; however, associated impacts are currently unknown. The Southern Company system has transitioned from an electric generating mix of 70% coal and 15% natural gas in 2007 to a mix of 22% coal and 51% natural gas in 2022. This transition has been supported in part by the Southern Company system retiring over 6,700 MWs of coal-fired generating capacity since 2010 and converting 3,700 MWs of generating capacity from coal to natural gas since 2015. In addition, the Southern Company system's capacity mix consists of over 11,500 MWs of renewable and storage facilities through ownership and long-term PPAs. See ""Environmental Laws and Regulations – Water Quality"" herein for information on plans to retire or convert to natural gas additional coal-fired generating capacity. In addition, Southern Company Gas has replaced over 6,000 miles of pipe material that was more prone to fugitive emissions (unprotected steel and cast-iron pipe), resulting in mitigation of more than 3.3 million metric tons of CO2 equivalents from its natural gas distribution system since 1998.The following table provides the Registrants' 2021 and preliminary 2022 Scope 1 GHG emissions based on equity share of facilities:2021Preliminary 2022(in million metric tons of CO2 equivalent)Southern Company(*)8285Alabama Power(*)3435Georgia Power2323Mississippi Power89Southern Power1113Southern Company Gas(*)22(*)Includes GHG emissions attributable to disposed assets through the date of the applicable disposition and to acquired assets beginning with the date of the applicable acquisition. See Note 15 to the financial statements for additional information.Southern Company system management has established an intermediate goal of a 50% reduction in GHG emissions from 2007 levels by 2030 and a long-term goal of net zero GHG emissions by 2050. Based on the preliminary 2022 emissions, the Southern Company system has achieved an estimated GHG emission reduction of 46% since 2007. GHG emissions increased in 2022 due to an increase in generation when compared to 2021 resulting from increased electricity sales, as discussed further under RESULTS OF OPERATIONS – ""Southern Company – Electricity Business"" herein. Southern Company system management expects to achieve sustained GHG emissions reductions of at least 50% as early as 2025. While none of Southern Company's subsidiaries are currently subject to renewable portfolio standards or similar requirements, management of the traditional electric operating companies is working with applicable regulators through their IRP processes to continue the generating fleet transition in a manner responsible to customers, communities, employees, and other stakeholders. Achievement of these goals is dependent on many factors, including natural gas prices and the pace and extent of development and deployment of low- to no-GHG energy technologies and negative carbon concepts. Southern Company system management plans to continue to pursue a diverse portfolio including low-carbon and carbon-free resources and energy efficiency resources; continue to transition the Southern Company system's generating fleet and make the necessary related investments in transmission and distribution systems; implement initiatives to reduce natural gas distribution operational emissions; continue its research and development with a particular focus on technologies that lower GHG emissions, including methods of removing carbon from the atmosphere; and constructively engage with policymakers, regulators, investors, customers, and other stakeholders to support outcomes leading to a net zero future.II-43 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISRegulatory MattersSee OVERVIEW – ""Recent Developments"" herein and Note 2 to the financial statements for a discussion of regulatory matters related to Alabama Power, Georgia Power, Mississippi Power, and Southern Company Gas, including items that could impact the applicable Registrants' future earnings, cash flows, and/or financial condition.Construction ProgramsThe Subsidiary Registrants are engaged in continuous construction programs to accommodate existing and estimated future loads on their respective systems. The Southern Company system strategy continues to include developing and constructing new electric generating facilities, expanding and improving the electric transmission and electric and natural gas distribution systems, and undertaking projects to comply with environmental laws and regulations.For the traditional electric operating companies, major generation construction projects are subject to state PSC approval in order to be included in retail rates. The largest construction project currently underway in the Southern Company system is Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Georgia Power – Nuclear Construction"" for additional information. Also see Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Alabama Power – Certificates of Convenience and Necessity"" for information regarding Alabama Power's construction of Plant Barry Unit 8.See Note 15 to the financial statements under ""Southern Power"" for information about costs relating to Southern Power's construction of renewable energy facilities.Southern Company Gas is engaged in various infrastructure improvement programs designed to update or expand the natural gas distribution systems of the natural gas distribution utilities to improve reliability, reduce emissions, and meet operational flexibility and growth. The natural gas distribution utilities recover their investment and a return associated with these infrastructure programs through their regulated rates. See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Southern Company Gas – Infrastructure Replacement Programs and Capital Projects"" for additional information on Southern Company Gas' construction program.See FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY – ""Cash Requirements"" herein for additional information regarding the Registrants' capital requirements for their construction programs, including estimated totals for each of the next five years.Southern Power's Power Sales AgreementsGeneralSouthern Power has PPAs with some of the traditional electric operating companies, other investor-owned utilities, IPPs, municipalities, and other load-serving entities, as well as commercial and industrial customers. The PPAs are expected to provide Southern Power with a stable source of revenue during their respective terms.Many of Southern Power's PPAs have provisions that require Southern Power or the counterparty to post collateral or an acceptable substitute guarantee if (i) S&P or Moody's downgrades the credit ratings of the respective company to an unacceptable credit rating, (ii) the counterparty is not rated, or (iii) the counterparty fails to maintain a minimum coverage ratio.Southern Power works to maintain and expand its share of the wholesale market. During 2022, Southern Power continued to be successful in remarketing up to 1,175 MWs of annual natural gas generation capacity to load-serving entities through several PPAs extending over the next eight years. Market demand is being driven by load-serving entities replacing expired purchase contracts and/or retired generation, as well as planning for future growth.Natural GasSouthern Power's electricity sales from natural gas facilities are primarily through long-term PPAs that consist of two types of agreements. The first type, referred to as a unit or block sale, is a customer purchase from a dedicated generating unit where all or a portion of the generation from that unit is reserved for that customer. Southern Power typically has the ability to serve the unit or block sale customer from an alternate resource. The second type, referred to as requirements service, provides that Southern Power serve the customer's capacity and energy requirements from a combination of the customer's own generating units and from Southern Power resources not dedicated to serve unit or block sales. Southern Power has rights to purchase power provided by the requirements customers' resources when economically viable.As a general matter, substantially all of the PPAs provide that the purchasers are responsible for either procuring the fuel (tolling agreements) or reimbursing Southern Power for substantially all of the cost of fuel or purchased power relating to the energy delivered under such PPAs. To the extent a particular generating facility does not meet the operational requirements contemplated in the PPAs, Southern Power may be responsible for excess fuel costs. With respect to fuel transportation risk, most of Southern II-44 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISPower's PPAs provide that the counterparties are responsible for the availability of fuel transportation to the particular generating facility.Capacity charges that form part of the PPA payments are designed to recover fixed and variable operation and maintenance costs based on dollars-per-kilowatt year. In general, to reduce Southern Power's exposure to certain operation and maintenance costs, Southern Power has LTSAs. See Note 1 to the financial statements under ""Long-Term Service Agreements"" for additional information.Solar and WindSouthern Power's electricity sales from solar and wind generating facilities are also primarily through long-term PPAs; however, these PPAs do not have a capacity charge and customers either purchase the energy output of a dedicated renewable facility through an energy charge or provide Southern Power a certain fixed price for the electricity sold to the grid. As a result, Southern Power's ability to recover fixed and variable operations and maintenance expenses is dependent upon the level of energy generated from these facilities, which can be impacted by weather conditions, equipment performance, transmission constraints, and other factors. Generally, under the renewable generation PPAs, the purchasing party retains the right to keep or resell the associated renewable energy credits.Income Tax MattersConsolidated Income TaxesThe impact of certain tax events at Southern Company and/or its other subsidiaries can, and does, affect each Registrant's ability to utilize certain tax credits. See ""Tax Credits"" and ACCOUNTING POLICIES – ""Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – Accounting for Income Taxes"" herein and Note 10 to the financial statements for additional information.Tax CreditsSouthern Company has received ITCs and PTCs in connection with investments in solar, wind, fuel cell facilities, and battery energy storage facilities (co-located with existing solar facilities) primarily at Southern Power and Georgia Power.Southern Power's ITCs relate to its investment in new solar facilities and battery energy storage facilities (co-located with existing solar facilities) that are acquired or constructed and its PTCs relate to the first 10 years of energy production from its wind facilities, which have had, and may continue to have, a material impact on Southern Power's cash flows and net income. At December 31, 2022, Southern Company and Southern Power had approximately $1.1 billion and $0.8 billion, respectively, of unutilized federal ITCs and PTCs, which are currently expected to be fully utilized by 2026, but could be further delayed. Since 2018, Southern Power has been utilizing tax equity partnerships for wind, solar, and battery energy storage projects, where the tax partner takes significantly all of the respective federal tax benefits. These tax equity partnerships are consolidated in Southern Company's and Southern Power's financial statements using the HLBV methodology to allocate partnership gains and losses. See Note 1 to the financial statements under ""General"" for additional information on the HLBV methodology and Note 1 to the financial statements under ""Income Taxes"" and Note 10 to the financial statements under ""Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities – Tax Credit Carryforwards"" and ""Effective Tax Rate"" for additional information regarding utilization and amortization of credits and the tax benefit related to associated basis differences.Inflation Reduction ActOn August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) was signed into law. The IRA extends, expands, and increases ITCs and PTCs for clean energy projects, allows PTCs for solar projects, adds ITCs for stand-alone energy storage projects with an option to elect out of the tax normalization requirement, and allows for the transferability of the tax credits. The IRA extends and increases the tax credits for carbon capture and sequestration projects and adds tax credits for clean hydrogen and nuclear projects. Additional ITC and PTC amounts are available if the projects meet domestic content requirements or are located in low-income or energy communities. The IRA also enacted a 15% corporate minimum tax on book income, with material adjustments for pension costs and tax depreciation. The 15% corporate minimum tax on book income can be reduced by energy tax credits.For solar projects placed in service in 2022 through 2032, the IRA provides for a 30% ITC and an option to claim a PTC instead of an ITC. Starting in 2023 and through 2032, the IRA provides for a 30% ITC for stand-alone energy storage projects. For wind projects placed in service in 2022 through 2032, the IRA provides for a 100% PTC, adjusted for inflation annually. For projects placed in service before 2022, the 2022 PTC rate is 2.6 cents per KWH. For projects placed in service in 2022, the 2022 PTC rate II-45 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISis 2.75 cents per KWH. The same PTC rate applies for solar projects for which the PTC option has been elected. To realize the full value of ITCs and PTCs, the IRA requires satisfaction of prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements.Implementation of the IRA provisions is subject to the issuance of additional guidance by the U.S. Treasury Department and the IRS, and the ultimate impacts cannot be determined at this time; however, the IRA is not expected to have a material impact on the Registrants' financial statements for the year ending December 31, 2023.General Litigation and Other MattersThe Registrants are involved in various matters being litigated and/or regulatory and other matters that could affect future earnings, cash flows, and/or financial condition. The ultimate outcome of such pending or potential litigation against each Registrant and any subsidiaries or regulatory and other matters cannot be determined at this time; however, for current proceedings and/or matters not specifically reported herein or in Notes 2 and 3 to the financial statements, management does not anticipate that the ultimate liabilities, if any, arising from such current proceedings and/or matters would have a material effect on such Registrant's financial statements. See Notes 2 and 3 to the financial statements for a discussion of various contingencies, including matters being litigated, regulatory matters, and other matters which may affect future earnings potential.ACCOUNTING POLICIESApplication of Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesThe Registrants prepare their financial statements in accordance with GAAP. Significant accounting policies are described in the notes to the financial statements. In the application of these policies, certain estimates are made that may have a material impact on the results of operations and related disclosures of the applicable Registrants (as indicated in the section descriptions herein). Different assumptions and measurements could produce estimates that are significantly different from those recorded in the financial statements. Senior management has reviewed and discussed the following critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of Southern Company's Board of Directors.Utility Regulation (Southern Company, Alabama Power, Georgia Power, Mississippi Power, and Southern Company Gas)The traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities are subject to retail regulation by their respective state PSCs or other applicable state regulatory agencies and wholesale regulation by the FERC. These regulatory agencies set the rates the traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities are permitted to charge customers based on allowable costs, including a reasonable ROE. As a result, the traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities apply accounting standards which require the financial statements to reflect the effects of rate regulation. Through the ratemaking process, the regulators may require the inclusion of costs or revenues in periods different than when they would be recognized by a non-regulated company. This treatment may result in the deferral of expenses and the recording of related regulatory assets based on anticipated future recovery through rates or the deferral of gains or creation of liabilities and the recording of related regulatory liabilities. The application of the accounting standards for rate regulated entities also impacts their financial statements as a result of the estimates of allowable costs used in the ratemaking process. These estimates may differ from those actually incurred by the traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities; therefore, the accounting estimates inherent in specific costs such as depreciation, AROs, and pension and other postretirement benefits have less of a direct impact on the results of operations and financial condition of the applicable Registrants than they would on a non-regulated company.Revenues related to regulated utility operations as a percentage of total operating revenues in 2022 for the applicable Registrants were as follows: 88% for Southern Company, 98% for Alabama Power, 97% for Georgia Power, 99% for Mississippi Power, and 88% for Southern Company Gas.As reflected in Note 2 to the financial statements, significant regulatory assets and liabilities have been recorded. Management reviews the ultimate recoverability of these regulatory assets and any requirement to refund these regulatory liabilities based on applicable regulatory guidelines and GAAP. However, adverse legislative, judicial, or regulatory actions could materially impact the amounts of such regulatory assets and liabilities and could adversely impact the financial statements of the applicable Registrants.Estimated Cost, Schedule, and Rate Recovery for the Construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4(Southern Company and Georgia Power)In 2016, the Georgia PSC approved the Vogtle Cost Settlement Agreement, which resolved certain prudency matters in connection with Georgia Power's fifteenth VCM report. In 2017, the Georgia PSC approved Georgia Power's seventeenth VCM report, which included a recommendation to continue construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, with Southern Nuclear serving as project manager and Bechtel serving as the primary construction contractor, as well as a modification of the Vogtle Cost II-46 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISSettlement Agreement. The Georgia PSC's related order stated that under the modified Vogtle Cost Settlement Agreement, (i) none of the $3.3 billion of costs incurred through December 31, 2015 should be disallowed as imprudent; (ii) the Contractor Settlement Agreement was reasonable and prudent and none of the $0.3 billion paid pursuant to the Contractor Settlement Agreement should be disallowed from rate base on the basis of imprudence; (iii) capital costs incurred up to $5.68 billion would be presumed to be reasonable and prudent with the burden of proof on any party challenging such costs; (iv) Georgia Power would have the burden of proof to show that any capital costs above $5.68 billion were prudent; (v) Georgia Power's total project capital cost forecast of $7.3 billion (net of $1.7 billion received under the Guarantee Settlement Agreement and approximately $188 million in related customer refunds) was found reasonable and did not represent a cost cap; and (vi) a prudence proceeding on cost recovery will occur subsequent to achieving fuel load for Unit 4. In its order, the Georgia PSC also stated if other conditions change and assumptions upon which Georgia Power's seventeenth VCM report are based do not materialize, the Georgia PSC reserved the right to reconsider the decision to continue construction.As of December 31, 2022, Georgia Power revised its total project capital cost forecast to $10.6 billion (net of $1.7 billion received under the Guarantee Settlement Agreement and approximately $188 million in related customer refunds). This forecast includes construction contingency of $60 million and is based on projected in-service dates at the end of the second quarter 2023 and the first quarter 2024 for Units 3 and 4, respectively. Since 2018, established construction contingency and additional costs totaling $2.5 billion have been assigned to the base capital cost forecast. Although Georgia Power believes these incremental costs are reasonable and necessary to complete the project and the Georgia PSC's order in the seventeenth VCM proceeding specifically states that the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 is not subject to a cost cap, Georgia Power will not seek rate recovery for the $0.7 billion increase to the base capital cost forecast included in the nineteenth VCM report and charged to income by Georgia Power in the second quarter 2018 and has not sought rate recovery for any subsequent construction and additional contingency costs assigned to the base capital cost forecast. After considering the significant level of uncertainty that exists regarding the future recoverability of these costs since the ultimate outcome of these matters is subject to the outcome of future assessments by management, as well as Georgia PSC decisions in these future regulatory proceedings, Georgia Power recorded total pre-tax charges to income of $1.1 billion ($0.8 billion after tax) in 2018; $149 million ($111 million after tax) and $176 million ($131 million after tax) in the second quarter and the fourth quarter 2020, respectively; $48 million ($36 million after tax), $460 million ($343 million after tax), $264 million ($197 million after tax), and $480 million ($358 million after tax) in the first quarter 2021, the second quarter 2021, the third quarter 2021, and the fourth quarter 2021, respectively; and $36 million ($27 million after tax), $32 million ($24 million after tax), and $148 million ($110 million after tax) in the second quarter 2022, the third quarter 2022, and the fourth quarter 2022, respectively.Georgia Power and the other Vogtle Owners do not agree on either the starting dollar amount for the determination of cost increases subject to the cost-sharing and tender provisions of the Global Amendments (as defined in Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Georgia Power – Nuclear Construction – Joint Owner Contracts"") or the extent to which COVID-19-related costs impact those provisions. The other Vogtle Owners notified Georgia Power that they believe the project capital cost forecast approved by the Vogtle Owners on February 14, 2022 triggered the tender provisions. On June 17, 2022 and July 26, 2022, OPC and Dalton, respectively, notified Georgia Power of their purported exercises of their tender options. Georgia Power did not accept these purported tender exercises. On September 29, 2022, Georgia Power and MEAG Power reached an agreement to resolve their dispute regarding the proper interpretation of the cost-sharing and tender provisions of the Global Amendments. Under the terms of the agreement, among other items, (i) MEAG Power will not exercise its tender option and will retain its full ownership interest in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4; (ii) Georgia Power will reimburse a portion of MEAG Power's costs of construction for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 as such costs are incurred and with no further adjustment for force majeure costs, which payments will total approximately $92 million based on the current project capital cost forecast; and (iii) Georgia Power will reimburse 20% of MEAG Power's costs of construction with respect to any amounts over the current project capital cost forecast, with no further adjustment for force majeure costs.Georgia Power recorded additional pre-tax charges (credits) to income of approximately $440 million ($328 million after tax) in the fourth quarter 2021 and approximately $16 million ($12 million after tax), $(102) million ($(76) million after tax), and $53 million ($40 million after tax) in the second quarter 2022, the third quarter 2022, and the fourth quarter 2022, respectively, associated with the cost-sharing and tender provisions of the Global Amendments, including the settlement with MEAG Power. A total of $407 million associated with these provisions is included in the total project capital cost forecast and will not be recovered from retail customers. The settlement with MEAG Power does not resolve the separate pending litigation with OPC, including Dalton's associated complaint, regarding the cost-sharing and tender provisions of the Global Amendments described in Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Georgia Power – Nuclear Construction – Joint Owner Contracts."" Georgia Power may be required to record further pre-tax charges to income of up to approximately $345 million associated with these provisions for OPC and Dalton based on the current project capital cost forecast.Georgia Power's ownership interest in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 continues to be 45.7%. Georgia Power believes the increases in the total project capital cost forecast through December 31, 2022 will trigger the tender provisions, but Georgia Power disagrees II-47 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISwith OPC and Dalton on the tender provisions trigger date. Valid notices of tender from OPC and Dalton would require Georgia Power to pay 100% of their respective remaining shares of the costs necessary to complete Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Georgia Power's incremental ownership interest will be calculated and conveyed to Georgia Power after Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 are placed in service.As part of its ongoing processes, Southern Nuclear continues to evaluate cost and schedule forecasts on a regular basis to incorporate current information available, particularly in the areas of start-up testing and related test results, engineering support, commodity installation, system turnovers, and workforce statistics.The projected schedule for Unit 3 primarily depends on the progression of final component and pre-operational testing and start-up, which may be impacted by further equipment, component, and/or other operational challenges. The projected schedule for Unit 4 primarily depends on potential impacts arising from Unit 4 testing activities overlapping with Unit 3 start-up and commissioning; maintaining overall construction productivity and production levels, particularly in subcontractor scopes of work; and maintaining appropriate levels of craft laborers. Any further delays could result in later in-service dates and cost increases.Various design and other licensing-based compliance matters, including the timely submittal by Southern Nuclear of the ITAAC documentation and the related reviews and approvals by the NRC necessary to support NRC authorization to load fuel for Unit 4, may arise, which may result in additional license amendment requests or require other resolution. If any license amendment requests or other licensing-based compliance issues, including inspections and ITAACs for Unit 4, are not resolved in a timely manner, there may be delays in the project schedule that could result in increased costs.The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time. However, any extension of the in-service date beyond the second quarter 2023 for Unit 3 or the first quarter 2024 for Unit 4, including the joint owner cost sharing and tender impacts described in Note 2, is estimated to result in additional base capital costs for Georgia Power of up to $15 million per month for Unit 3 and $35 million per month for Unit 4, as well as the related AFUDC and any additional related construction, support resources, or testing costs. While Georgia Power is not precluded from seeking retail recovery of any future capital cost forecast increase other than the amounts related to the cost-sharing and tender provisions of the joint ownership agreements described above, management will ultimately determine whether or not to seek recovery. Any further changes to the capital cost forecast that are not expected to be recoverable through regulated rates will be required to be charged to income and such charges could be material.Given the significant complexity involved in estimating the future costs to complete construction and start-up of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 and the significant management judgment necessary to assess the related uncertainties surrounding future rate recovery of any projected cost increases, as well as the potential impact on results of operations and cash flows, Southern Company and Georgia Power consider these items to be critical accounting estimates. See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Georgia Power – Nuclear Construction"" for additional information.Accounting for Income Taxes (Southern Company, Georgia Power, Mississippi Power, Southern Power, and Southern Company Gas)The consolidated income tax provision and deferred income tax assets and liabilities, as well as any unrecognized tax benefits and valuation allowances, require significant judgment and estimates. These estimates are supported by historical tax return data, reasonable projections of taxable income, the ability and intent to implement tax planning strategies if necessary, and interpretations of applicable tax laws and regulations across multiple taxing jurisdictions. The effective tax rate reflects the statutory tax rates and calculated apportionments for the various states in which the Southern Company system operates.Southern Company files a consolidated federal income tax return and the Registrants file various state income tax returns, some of which are combined or unitary. Under a joint consolidated income tax allocation agreement, each Southern Company subsidiary's current and deferred tax expense is computed on a stand-alone basis and each subsidiary is allocated an amount of tax similar to that which would be paid if it filed a separate income tax return. In accordance with IRS regulations, each company is jointly and severally liable for the federal tax liability. Certain deductions and credits can be limited or utilized at the consolidated or combined level resulting in tax credit and/or state NOL carryforwards that would not otherwise result on a stand-alone basis. Utilization of these carryforwards and the assessment of valuation allowances are based on significant judgment and extensive analysis of Southern Company's and its subsidiaries' current financial position and results of operations, including currently available information about future years, to estimate when future taxable income will be realized. See Note 10 to the financial statements under ""Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities – Tax Credit Carryforwards"" and "" – Net Operating Loss Carryforwards"" for additional information.Current and deferred state income tax liabilities and assets are estimated based on laws of multiple states that determine the income to be apportioned to their jurisdictions. States have various filing methodologies and utilize specific formulas to calculate the apportionment of taxable income. The calculation of deferred state taxes considers apportionment factors and filing II-48 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISmethodologies that are expected to apply in future years. Any apportionments and/or filing methodologies ultimately finalized in a manner inconsistent with expectations could have a material effect on the financial statements of the applicable Registrants.Given the significant judgment involved in estimating tax credit and/or state NOL carryforwards and multi-state apportionments for all subsidiaries, the applicable Registrants consider deferred income tax liabilities and assets to be critical accounting estimates.Asset Retirement Obligations (Southern Company, Alabama Power, Georgia Power, Mississippi Power, and Southern Company Gas)AROs are computed as the present value of the estimated costs for an asset's future retirement and are recorded in the period in which the liability is incurred. The estimated costs are capitalized as part of the related long-lived asset and depreciated over the asset's useful life. In the absence of quoted market prices, AROs are estimated using present value techniques in which estimates of future cash outlays associated with the asset retirements are discounted using a credit-adjusted risk-free rate. Estimates of the timing and amounts of future cash outlays are based on projections of when and how the assets will be retired and the cost of future removal activities.The ARO liabilities for the traditional electric operating companies primarily relate to facilities that are subject to the CCR Rule and the related state rules, principally ash ponds. In addition, Alabama Power and Georgia Power have retirement obligations related to the decommissioning of nuclear facilities (Alabama Power's Plant Farley and Georgia Power's ownership interests in Plant Hatch and Plant Vogtle Units 1 and 2). Other significant AROs include various landfill sites and asbestos removal for Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and Mississippi Power and gypsum cells and mine reclamation for Mississippi Power.The traditional electric operating companies and Southern Company Gas also have identified other retirement obligations, such as obligations related to certain electric transmission and distribution facilities, certain asbestos-containing material within long-term assets not subject to ongoing repair and maintenance activities, certain wireless communication towers, the disposal of polychlorinated biphenyls in certain transformers, leasehold improvements, equipment on customer property, and property associated with the Southern Company system's rail lines and natural gas pipelines. However, liabilities for the removal of these assets have not been recorded because the settlement timing for certain retirement obligations related to these assets is indeterminable and, therefore, the fair value of the retirement obligations cannot be reasonably estimated. A liability for these retirement obligations will be recognized when sufficient information becomes available to support a reasonable estimation of the ARO.The cost estimates for AROs related to the disposal of CCR are based on information using various assumptions related to closure and post-closure costs, timing of future cash outlays, inflation and discount rates, and the potential methods for complying with the CCR Rule and the related state rules. The traditional electric operating companies have periodically updated, and expect to continue periodically updating, their related cost estimates and ARO liabilities for each CCR unit as additional information related to these assumptions becomes available. Some of these updates have been, and future updates may be, material. See Note 6 to the financial statements for additional information, including updates to AROs related to ash ponds recorded during 2022 by certain Registrants.Given the significant judgment involved in estimating AROs, the applicable Registrants consider the liabilities for AROs to be critical accounting estimates.Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits (Southern Company, Alabama Power, Georgia Power, Mississippi Power, and Southern Company Gas)The applicable Registrants' calculations of pension and other postretirement benefits expense are dependent on a number of assumptions. These assumptions include discount rates, healthcare cost trend rates, expected long-term rate of return (LRR) on plan assets, mortality rates, expected salary and wage increases, and other factors. Components of pension and other postretirement benefits expense include interest and service cost on the pension and other postretirement benefit plans, expected return on plan assets, and amortization of certain unrecognized costs and obligations. Actual results that differ from the assumptions utilized are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, generally affect recognized expense and the recorded obligation in future periods. While the applicable Registrants believe the assumptions used are appropriate, differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions would affect their pension and other postretirement benefit costs and obligations.Key elements in determining the applicable Registrants' pension and other postretirement benefit expense are the LRR and the discount rate used to measure the benefit plan obligations and the periodic benefit plan expense for future periods. For purposes of determining the applicable Registrants' liabilities related to the pension and other postretirement benefit plans, Southern Company discounts the future related cash flows using a single-point discount rate for each plan developed from the weighted average of market-observed yields for high quality fixed income securities with maturities that correspond to expected benefit payments. The II-49 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISdiscount rate assumption impacts both the service cost and non-service costs components of net periodic benefit costs as well as the projected benefit obligations.The LRR on pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets is based on Southern Company's investment strategy, as described in Note 11 to the financial statements, historical experience, and expectations that consider external actuarial advice, and represents the average rate of earnings expected over the long term on the assets invested to provide for anticipated future benefit payments. Southern Company determines the amount of the expected return on plan assets component of non-service costs by applying the LRR of various asset classes to Southern Company's target asset allocation. The LRR only impacts the non-service costs component of net periodic benefit costs for the following year and is set annually at the beginning of the year.The following table illustrates the sensitivity to changes in the applicable Registrants' long-term assumptions with respect to the discount rate, salary increases, and the long-term rate of return on plan assets:Increase/(Decrease) in25 Basis Point Change in:Total Benefit Expense for 2023Projected Obligation for Pension Plan at December 31, 2022Projected Obligation forOther PostretirementBenefit Plans at December 31, 2022(in millions)Discount rate:Southern Company$33/$(25)$395/$(375)$35/$(33)Alabama Power$9/$(9)$95/$(90)$9/$(8)Georgia Power$9/$(9)$116/$(111)$12/$(12)Mississippi Power$2/$(1)$18/$(17)$1/$(1)Southern Company Gas$2/$(2)$25/$(24)$4/$(4)Salaries:Southern Company$16/$(15)$81/$(79)$–/$–Alabama Power$5/$(4)$23/$(22)$–/$–Georgia Power$5/$(4)$22/$(22)$–/$–Mississippi Power$1/$(1)$3/$(3)$–/$–Southern Company Gas$1/$(0)$2/$(2)$–/$–Long-term return on plan assets:Southern Company$39/$(39)N/AN/AAlabama Power$10/$(10)N/AN/AGeorgia Power$12/$(12)N/AN/AMississippi Power$2/$(2)N/AN/ASouthern Company Gas$3/$(3)N/AN/ASee Note 11 to the financial statements for additional information regarding pension and other postretirement benefits.Asset Impairment (Southern Company, Southern Power, and Southern Company Gas)Goodwill (Southern Company and Southern Company Gas)The acquisition method of accounting for business combinations requires the assets acquired and liabilities assumed to be recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective estimated fair values. The applicable Registrants have recognized goodwill as of the date of their acquisitions, as a residual over the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis in the fourth quarter of the year and on an interim basis if events and circumstances occur that indicate goodwill may be impaired. A reporting unit is the operating segment, or a business one level below the operating segment (a component), if discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by management. Components are aggregated if they have similar economic characteristics.As part of the goodwill impairment tests, the applicable Registrant may perform an initial qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit is less than its carrying amount before applying the quantitative goodwill impairment test. If the applicable Registrant elects to perform the qualitative assessment, it evaluates relevant events and circumstances, including but not limited to, macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, cost II-50 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISfactors, financial performance, entity specific events, and events specific to each reporting unit. If the applicable Registrant determines that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, or it elects not to perform a qualitative assessment, it compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount to determine if the fair value is greater than its carrying amount.Goodwill for Southern Company and Southern Company Gas was $5.2 billion and $5.0 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2022. During the fourth quarter 2022, Southern Company recorded a $119 million impairment loss as a result of its annual goodwill impairment test for PowerSecure.The judgments made in determining the estimated fair value assigned to each class of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as well as asset lives, can significantly impact the applicable Registrant's results of operations. Fair values and useful lives are determined based on, among other factors, the expected future period of benefit of the asset, the various characteristics of the asset, and projected cash flows. As the determination of an asset's fair value and useful life involves management making certain estimates and because these estimates form the basis for the determination of whether or not an impairment charge should be recorded, the applicable Registrants consider these estimates to be critical accounting estimates.See Note 1 to the financial statements under ""Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets and Liabilities"" for additional information regarding the applicable Registrants' goodwill.Long-Lived Assets (Southern Company, Southern Power, and Southern Company Gas)The applicable Registrants assess their other long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset's carrying amount may not be recoverable. If an indicator exists, the asset is tested for recoverability by comparing the asset carrying amount to the sum of the undiscounted expected future cash flows directly attributable to the asset's use and eventual disposition. If the estimate of undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset, the fair value of the asset is determined and a loss is recorded equal to the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset. In addition, when assets are identified as held for sale, an impairment loss is recognized to the extent the carrying amount of the assets or asset group exceeds their fair value less cost to sell. A high degree of judgment is required in developing estimates related to these evaluations, which are based on projections of various factors, some of which have been quite volatile in recent years. Impairments of long-lived assets of the traditional electric utilities and natural gas distribution utilities are generally related to specific regulatory disallowances.Southern Power's investments in long-lived assets are primarily generation assets. Excluding the natural gas distribution utilities, Southern Company Gas' investments in long-lived assets are primarily natural gas transportation and storage facility assets.For Southern Power, examples of impairment indicators could include significant changes in construction schedules, current period losses combined with a history of losses or a projection of continuing losses, a significant decrease in market prices, changes in tax legislation, the inability to remarket generating capacity for an extended period, the unplanned termination of a customer contract, or the inability of a customer to perform under the terms of the contract. For Southern Company Gas, examples of impairment indicators could include, but are not limited to, significant changes in the U.S. natural gas storage market, construction schedules, current period losses combined with a history of losses or a projection of continuing losses, a significant decrease in market prices, the inability to renew or extend customer contracts or the inability of a customer to perform under the terms of the contract, attrition rates, or the inability to deploy a development project.As the determination of the expected future cash flows generated from an asset, an asset's fair value, and useful life involves management making certain estimates and because these estimates form the basis for the determination of whether or not an impairment charge should be recorded, the applicable Registrants consider these estimates to be critical accounting estimates.During 2021 and 2020, Southern Company recorded impairment charges totaling $7 million ($6 million after tax) and $206 million ($105 million after tax), respectively, related to its leveraged lease investments. During 2022, Southern Company Gas recorded pre-tax impairment charges totaling $131 million ($99 million after tax) related to natural gas storage facilities. During 2021, Southern Company Gas recorded total pre-tax impairment charges of $84 million ($67 million after tax) related to its equity method investment in the PennEast Pipeline project. See Notes 7 and 9 to the financial statements under ""Southern Company Gas"" and ""Southern Company Leveraged Lease,"" respectively, and Note 15 to the financial statements for additional information on recent asset impairments.Revenue Recognition (Southern Power)Southern Power's power sale transactions, which include PPAs, are classified in one of four general categories: leases, non-derivatives or normal sale derivatives, derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, and derivatives not designated as hedges. Southern Power's revenues are dependent upon significant judgments used to determine the appropriate transaction classification, II-51 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISwhich must be documented upon the inception of each contract. The two categories with the most judgment required for Southern Power are described further below.Lease TransactionsSouthern Power considers the terms of a sales contract to determine whether it should be accounted for as a lease. A contract is or contains a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of identified property, plant, or equipment for a period of time in exchange for consideration. If the contract meets the criteria for a lease, Southern Power performs further analysis to determine whether the lease is classified as operating, financing, or sales-type. Generally, Southern Power's power sales contracts that are determined to be leases are accounted for as operating leases and the capacity revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract and is included in Southern Power's operating revenues. Energy revenues and other contingent revenues are recognized in the period the energy is delivered or the service is rendered. For those contracts that are determined to be sales-type leases, capacity revenues are recognized by accounting for interest income on the net investment in the lease and are included in Southern Power's operating revenues. See Note 9 to the financial statements for additional information.Non-Derivative and Normal Sale Derivative TransactionsIf the power sales contract is not classified as a lease, Southern Power further considers whether the contract meets the definition of a derivative. If the contract does meet the definition of a derivative, Southern Power will assess whether it can be designated as a normal sale contract. The determination of whether a contract can be designated as a normal sale contract requires judgment, including whether the sale of electricity involves physical delivery in quantities within Southern Power's available generating capacity and that the purchaser will take quantities expected to be used or sold in the normal course of business.Contracts that do not meet the definition of a derivative or are designated as normal sales are accounted for as executory contracts. For contracts that have a capacity charge, the revenue is generally recognized in the period that it becomes billable. Revenues related to energy and ancillary services are recognized in the period the energy is delivered or the service is rendered. See Note 4 to the financial statements for additional information.Acquisition Accounting (Southern Power)Southern Power may acquire generation assets as part of its overall growth strategy. At the time of an acquisition, Southern Power will assess if these assets and activities meet the definition of a business. Acquisitions that meet the definition of a business are accounted for under the acquisition method, whereby the purchase price, including any contingent consideration, is allocated based on the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed (including any intangible assets, primarily related to acquired PPAs). Assets acquired that do not meet the definition of a business are accounted for as an asset acquisition. The purchase price of each asset acquisition is allocated based on the relative fair value of assets acquired. Determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management judgment and Southern Power may engage independent valuation experts to assist in this process. Fair values are determined by using market participant assumptions, and typically include the timing and amounts of future cash flows, incurred construction costs, the nature of acquired contracts, discount rates, power market prices, and expected asset lives. Any due diligence or transition costs incurred by Southern Power for potential or successful acquisitions are expensed as incurred.See Note 13 to the financial statements for additional fair value information and Note 15 to the financial statements for additional information on recent acquisitions.Variable Interest Entities (Southern Power)Southern Power enters into partnerships with varying ownership structures. Upon entering into these arrangements, membership interests and other variable interests are evaluated to determine if the legal entity is a VIE. If the legal entity is a VIE, Southern Power will assess if it has both the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE, making it the primary beneficiary. Making this determination may require significant management judgment.If Southern Power is the primary beneficiary and is considered to have a controlling ownership, the assets, liabilities, and results of operations of the entity are consolidated. If Southern Power is not the primary beneficiary, the legal entity is generally accounted for under the equity method of accounting. Southern Power reconsiders its conclusions as to whether the legal entity is a VIE and whether it is the primary beneficiary for events that impact the rights of variable interests, such as ownership changes in membership interests.Southern Power has controlling ownership in certain legal entities for which the contractual provisions represent profit-sharing arrangements because the allocations of cash distributions and tax benefits are not based on fixed ownership percentages. For these arrangements, the noncontrolling interest is accounted for under a balance sheet approach utilizing the HLBV method. The II-52 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISHLBV method calculates each partner's share of income based on the change in net equity the partner can legally claim in a HLBV at the end of the period compared to the beginning of the period.Contingent Obligations (All Registrants)The Registrants are subject to a number of federal and state laws and regulations, as well as other factors and conditions that subject them to environmental, litigation, and other risks. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL herein and Notes 2 and 3 to the financial statements for more information regarding certain of these contingencies. The Registrants periodically evaluate their exposure to such risks and record reserves for those matters where a non-tax-related loss is considered probable and reasonably estimable. The adequacy of reserves can be significantly affected by external events or conditions that can be unpredictable; thus, the ultimate outcome of such matters could materially affect the results of operations, cash flows, or financial condition of the Registrants.Recently Issued Accounting StandardsIn March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting (ASU 2020-04) providing temporary guidance to ease the potential burden in accounting for reference rate reform primarily resulting from the discontinuation of LIBOR, which began phasing out on December 31, 2021. The discontinuation date of the overnight 1-, 3-, 6-, and 12-month tenors of LIBOR is June 30, 2023, which is beyond the original effective date of ASU 2020-04; therefore, on December 21, 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-06, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Deferral of the Sunset Date of Topic 848 (ASU 2022-06) to defer the sunset date of ASU 2020-04 from December 31, 2022 to December 31, 2024.The amendments are elective and apply to all entities that have contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions that reference LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued. The guidance (i) simplifies accounting analyses under current GAAP for contract modifications; (ii) simplifies the assessment of hedge effectiveness and allows hedging relationships affected by reference rate reform to continue; and (iii) allows a one-time election to sell or transfer debt securities classified as held to maturity that reference a rate affected by reference rate reform. An entity may elect to apply the amendments prospectively from March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2024 by accounting topic. The Registrants have elected to apply the amendments to modifications of debt and derivative arrangements that meet the scope of ASU 2020-04 and ASU 2022-06.The Registrants currently reference LIBOR for certain debt and hedging arrangements. In addition, certain provisions in PPAs at Southern Power include references to LIBOR. Contract language has been, or is expected to be, incorporated into each of these agreements to address the transition to an alternative rate for agreements that will be in place at the transition date. No material impacts are expected from modifications to the arrangements and effective hedging relationships are expected to continue. See FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY – ""Overview"" and ""Financing Activities"" herein and Note 14 to the financial statements under ""Interest Rate Derivatives"" for additional information.FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITYOverviewThe financial condition of each Registrant remained stable at December 31, 2022. The Registrants' cash requirements primarily consist of funding ongoing operations, including unconsolidated subsidiaries, as well as common stock dividends, capital expenditures, and debt maturities. Southern Power's cash requirements also include distributions to noncontrolling interests. Capital expenditures and other investing activities for the traditional electric operating companies include investments to build new generation facilities to meet projected long-term demand requirements and to replace units being retired as part of the generation fleet transition, to maintain existing generation facilities, to comply with environmental regulations including adding environmental modifications to certain existing generating units and closures of ash ponds, to expand and improve transmission and distribution facilities, and for restoration following major storms. Southern Power's capital expenditures and other investing activities may include acquisitions or new construction associated with its overall growth strategy and to maintain its existing generation fleet's performance. Southern Company Gas' capital expenditures and other investing activities include investments to meet projected long-term demand requirements, to maintain existing natural gas distribution systems as well as to update and expand these systems, and to comply with environmental regulations. See ""Cash Requirements"" herein for additional information.Operating cash flows provide a substantial portion of the Registrants' cash needs. During 2022, Southern Power utilized tax credits, which provided $49 million in operating cash flows. For the three-year period from 2023 through 2025, projected stock dividends, capital expenditures, and debt maturities are expected to exceed operating cash flows for each of Southern Company, the traditional electric operating companies, and Southern Company Gas. Southern Company plans to finance future cash needs in excess of its operating cash flows through one or more of the following: accessing borrowings from financial institutions, issuing debt and hybrid securities in the capital markets, and/or through its stock plans. Each Subsidiary Registrant plans to finance its II-53 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISfuture cash needs in excess of its operating cash flows primarily through external securities issuances, borrowings from financial institutions, and equity contributions from Southern Company. In addition, Southern Power plans to utilize tax equity partnership contributions. The Registrants plan to use commercial paper to manage seasonal variations in operating cash flows and for other working capital needs and continue to monitor their access to short-term and long-term capital markets as well as their bank credit arrangements to meet future capital and liquidity needs. See ""Sources of Capital"" and ""Financing Activities"" herein for additional information.To facilitate an orderly transition from LIBOR to alternative benchmark rate(s), the Registrants have established an initiative to assess and mitigate risks associated with the discontinuation of LIBOR. As part of this initiative, several alternative benchmark rates have been, and continue to be, evaluated and implemented. Substantially all of the Registrants' credit facilities allow for LIBOR to be phased out and replaced with SOFR and interest rate derivatives address the LIBOR transition through the adoption of the ISDA 2020 IBOR Fallbacks Protocol and subsequent amendments. None of the Registrants expects the transition from LIBOR to have a material impact.The Registrants' investments in their qualified pension plans and Alabama Power's and Georgia Power's investments in their nuclear decommissioning trust funds decreased in value at December 31, 2022 as compared to December 31, 2021. No contributions to the qualified pension plan were made during 2022 and no mandatory contributions to the qualified pension plans are anticipated during 2023. See Notes 6 and 11 to the financial statements under ""Nuclear Decommissioning"" and ""Pension Plans,"" respectively, for additional information.At the end of 2022, the market price of Southern Company's common stock was $71.41 per share (based on the closing price as reported on the NYSE) and the book value was $27.93 per share, representing a market-to-book value ratio of 256%, compared to $68.58, $26.30, and 261%, respectively, at the end of 2021.Cash RequirementsCapital ExpendituresTotal estimated capital expenditures, including LTSA and nuclear fuel commitments, for the Registrants through 2027 based on their current construction programs are as follows:20232024202520262027(in billions)Southern Company(a)(b)(c)$9.1 $8.1 $7.7 $7.9 $7.7 Alabama Power(a)2.0 1.9 1.9 1.8 1.9 Georgia Power(b)4.6 3.9 3.6 3.9 3.6 Mississippi Power0.3 0.3 0.3 0.2 0.2 Southern Power(c)0.1 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.1 Southern Company Gas1.8 1.8 1.8 1.8 1.8 (a)Includes expenditures of approximately $0.1 billion in 2023 for the construction of Plant Barry Unit 8. See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Alabama Power"" for additional information.(b)Includes expenditures of approximately $1.0 billion and $0.2 billion in 2023 and 2024, respectively, for the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4.(c)Excludes approximately $0.5 billion in 2023 and $0.8 billion per year for 2024 through 2027 for Southern Power's planned acquisitions and placeholder growth, which may vary materially due to market opportunities and Southern Power's ability to execute its growth strategy.These capital expenditures include estimates to comply with environmental laws and regulations, but do not include any potential compliance costs associated with any future regulation of CO2 emissions from fossil fuel-fired electric generating units. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – ""Environmental Matters"" herein for additional information. At December 31, 2022, significant purchase commitments were outstanding in connection with the Registrants' construction programs.II-54 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISThe traditional electric operating companies also anticipate continued expenditures associated with closure and monitoring of ash ponds and landfills in accordance with the CCR Rule and the related state rules, which are reflected in the applicable Registrants' ARO liabilities. The cost estimates for Alabama Power and Mississippi Power are based on closure-in-place for all ash ponds. The cost estimates for Georgia Power are based on a combination of closure-in-place for some ash ponds and closure by removal for others. These estimated costs are likely to change, and could change materially, as assumptions and details pertaining to closure are refined and compliance activities continue. Current estimates of these costs through 2027 are provided in the table below. Material expenditures in future years for ARO settlements will also be required for ash ponds, nuclear decommissioning (for Alabama Power and Georgia Power), and other liabilities reflected in the applicable Registrants' AROs, as discussed further in Note 6 to the financial statements. Also see FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – ""Environmental Matters – Environmental Laws and Regulations – Coal Combustion Residuals"" herein.20232024202520262027(in millions)Southern Company$672 $730 $765 $816 $712 Alabama Power330 346 364 299 237 Georgia Power295 330 345 482 469 Mississippi Power21 25 31 17 2 The construction programs are subject to periodic review and revision, and actual construction costs may vary from these estimates because of numerous factors. These factors include: changes in business conditions; changes in load projections; changes in environmental laws and regulations; the outcome of any legal challenges to environmental rules; changes in electric generating plants, including unit retirements and replacements and adding or changing fuel sources at existing electric generating units, to meet regulatory requirements; changes in FERC rules and regulations; state regulatory agency approvals; changes in the expected environmental compliance program; changes in legislation and/or regulation; the cost, availability, and efficiency of construction labor, equipment, and materials; project scope and design changes; abnormal weather; delays in construction due to judicial or regulatory action; storm impacts; and the cost of capital. The continued impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic could also impair the ability to develop, construct, and operate facilities, as discussed further in Item 1A herein. In addition, there can be no assurance that costs related to capital expenditures and AROs will be fully recovered. Additionally, expenditures associated with Southern Power's planned acquisitions may vary due to market opportunities and the execution of its growth strategy. See Note 15 to the financial statements under ""Southern Power"" for additional information regarding Southern Power's plant acquisitions and construction projects.The construction program of Georgia Power includes Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, which includes components based on new technology that only within the last few years began initial operation in the global nuclear industry at this scale and which may be subject to additional revised cost estimates during construction. See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Georgia Power – Nuclear Construction"" for information regarding Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 and additional factors that may impact construction expenditures.See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – ""Construction Programs"" herein for additional information.Other Significant Cash RequirementsLong-term debt maturities and the interest payable on long-term debt each represent a significant cash requirement for the Registrants. See Note 8 to the financial statements for information regarding the Registrants' long-term debt at December 31, 2022, the weighted average interest rate applicable to each long-term debt category, and a schedule of long-term debt maturities over the next five years. The Registrants plan to continue, when economically feasible, to retire higher-cost securities and replace these obligations with lower-cost capital if market conditions permit.II-55 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISFuel and purchased power costs represent a significant component of funding ongoing operations for the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power. See Note 3 to the financial statements under ""Commitments"" for information on Southern Company Gas' commitments for pipeline charges, storage capacity, and gas supply. Total estimated costs for fuel and purchased power commitments at December 31, 2022 for the applicable Registrants are provided in the table below. Fuel costs include purchases of coal (for the traditional electric operating companies) and natural gas (for the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power), as well as the related transportation and storage. In most cases, these contracts contain provisions for price escalation, minimum purchase levels, and other financial commitments. Natural gas purchase commitments are based on various indices at the time of delivery; the amounts reflected below have been estimated based on the NYMEX future prices at December 31, 2022. As discussed under ""Capital Expenditures"" herein, estimated expenditures for nuclear fuel are included in the applicable Registrants' construction programs for the years 2023 through 2027. Nuclear fuel commitments at December 31, 2022 that extend beyond 2027 are included in the table below. Purchased power costs represent estimated minimum obligations for various PPAs for the purchase of capacity and energy, except for those accounted for as leases, which are discussed in Note 9 to the financial statements.20232024202520262027Thereafter(in millions)Southern Company(*)$5,985 $3,605 $2,485 $1,260 $1,136 $6,052 Alabama Power1,623 1,067 820 343 313 1,363 Georgia Power(*)2,413 1,347 946 487 452 4,255 Mississippi Power789 496 280 160 143 418 Southern Power1,159 695 438 269 228 16 (*)Excludes capacity payments related to Plant Vogtle Units 1 and 2, which are discussed in Note 3 to the financial statements under ""Commitments.""In connection with Georgia Power's 2022 IRP, the Georgia PSC approved five affiliate PPAs with Southern Power, which are expected to be accounted for as leases, and are contingent upon approval by the FERC. The expected capacity payments associated with the PPAs total $5 million in 2024, $68 million in 2025, $75 million in 2026, $76 million in 2027, and $670 million thereafter. See Note 2 to the financial statements under ""Georgia Power – Integrated Resource Plans"" for additional information.The traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power have entered into LTSAs for the purpose of securing maintenance support for certain of their generating facilities. See Note 1 to the financial statements under ""Long-term Service Agreements"" for additional information. As discussed under ""Capital Expenditures"" herein, estimated expenditures related to LTSAs are included in the applicable Registrants' construction programs for the years 2023 through 2027. Total estimated payments for LTSA commitments at December 31, 2022 that extend beyond 2027 are provided in the following table and include price escalation based on inflation indices:SouthernCompanyAlabama PowerGeorgiaPowerMississippi PowerSouthern Power(in millions)LTSA commitments (after 2027)$1,779 $303 $305 $163 $1,008 In addition, Southern Power has certain other operations and maintenance agreements.

Equity capital can be provided from any combination of Southern Company's stock plans, private placements, or public offerings.II-56 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISThe Subsidiary Registrants plan to obtain the funds to meet their future capital needs from sources similar to those they used in the past, which were primarily from operating cash flows, external securities issuances, borrowings from financial institutions, and equity contributions from Southern Company. In addition, Southern Power plans to utilize tax equity partnership contributions (as discussed further herein). Georgia Power intends to continue utilizing short-term floating rate bank loans and commercial paper issuances to fund operating cash flows related to fuel cost under recovery.The amount, type, and timing of any financings in 2023, as well as in subsequent years, will be contingent on investment opportunities and the Registrants' capital requirements and will depend upon prevailing market conditions, regulatory approvals (for certain of the Subsidiary Registrants), and other factors. See ""Cash Requirements"" herein for additional information.Southern Power utilizes tax equity partnerships as one of its financing sources, where the tax partner takes significantly all of the federal tax benefits. These tax equity partnerships are consolidated in Southern Power's financial statements and are accounted for using HLBV methodology to allocate partnership gains and losses. During 2022, Southern Power obtained tax equity funding for existing tax equity partnerships totaling $51 million. See Notes 1 and 15 to the financial statements under ""General"" and ""Southern Power,"" respectively, for additional information.The issuance of securities by the traditional electric operating companies and Nicor Gas is generally subject to the approval of the applicable state PSC or other applicable state regulatory agency. The issuance of all securities by Mississippi Power and short-term securities by Georgia Power is generally subject to regulatory approval by the FERC. Additionally, with respect to the public offering of securities, Southern Company, the traditional electric operating companies, and Southern Power (excluding its subsidiaries), Southern Company Gas Capital, and Southern Company Gas (excluding its other subsidiaries) file registration statements with the SEC under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (1933 Act). The amounts of securities authorized by the appropriate regulatory authorities, as well as the securities registered under the 1933 Act, are closely monitored and appropriate filings are made to ensure flexibility in the capital markets.The Registrants generally obtain financing separately without credit support from any affiliate. See Note 8 to the financial statements under ""Bank Credit Arrangements"" for additional information. The Southern Company system does not maintain a centralized cash or money pool. Therefore, funds of each company are not commingled with funds of any other company in the Southern Company system, except in the case of Southern Company Gas, as described below.The traditional electric operating companies and SEGCO may utilize a Southern Company subsidiary organized to issue and sell commercial paper at their request and for their benefit. Proceeds from such issuances for the benefit of an individual company are loaned directly to that company. The obligations of each traditional electric operating company and SEGCO under these arrangements are several and there is no cross-affiliate credit support. Alabama Power also maintains its own separate commercial paper program.Southern Company Gas Capital obtains external financing for Southern Company Gas and its subsidiaries, other than Nicor Gas, which obtains financing separately without credit support from any affiliates. Southern Company Gas maintains commercial paper programs at Southern Company Gas Capital and Nicor Gas. Nicor Gas' commercial paper program supports its working capital needs as Nicor Gas is not permitted to make money pool loans to affiliates. All of the other Southern Company Gas subsidiaries benefit from Southern Company Gas Capital's commercial paper program.By regulation, Nicor Gas is restricted, to the extent of its retained earnings balance, in the amount it can dividend or loan to affiliates and is not permitted to make money pool loans to affiliates. At December 31, 2022, the amount of subsidiary retained earnings restricted to dividend totaled $1.5 billion. This restriction did not impact Southern Company Gas' ability to meet its cash obligations, nor does management expect such restriction to materially impact Southern Company Gas' ability to meet its currently anticipated cash obligations.II-57 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISCertain Registrants' current liabilities frequently exceed their current assets because of long-term debt maturities and the periodic use of short-term debt as a funding source, as well as significant seasonal fluctuations in cash needs. The Registrants generally plan to refinance long-term debt as it matures. See Note 8 to the financial statements for additional information. Also see ""Financing Activities"" herein for information on financing activities that occurred subsequent to December 31, 2022. The following table shows the amount by which current liabilities exceeded current assets at December 31, 2022 for the applicable Registrants:At December 31, 2022SouthernCompanyGeorgiaPowerMississippi PowerSouthern PowerSouthern Company Gas(in millions)Current liabilities in excess of current assets$5,308 $3,179 $50 $263 $532 The Registrants believe the need for working capital can be adequately met by utilizing operating cash flows, as well as commercial paper, lines of credit, and short-term bank notes, as market conditions permit. In addition, under certain circumstances, the Subsidiary Registrants may utilize equity contributions and/or loans from Southern Company.Bank Credit ArrangementsAt December 31, 2022, the Registrants' unused committed credit arrangements with banks were as follows:At December 31, 2022SouthernCompanyparentAlabama PowerGeorgiaPowerMississippi PowerSouthern Power(a)Southern Company Gas(b)SEGCOSouthernCompany(in millions)Unused committed credit$1,998 $1,250 $1,726 $275 $569 $1,748 $30 $7,596 (a)At December 31, 2022, Southern Power also had two continuing letters of credit facilities for standby letters of credit, of which $14 million was unused. Southern Power's subsidiaries are not parties to its bank credit arrangements or letter of credit facilities.(b)Includes $798 million and $950 million at Southern Company Gas Capital and Nicor Gas, respectively.Subject to applicable market conditions, the Registrants, Nicor Gas, and SEGCO expect to renew or replace their bank credit arrangements as needed, prior to expiration. In connection therewith, the Registrants, Nicor Gas, and SEGCO may extend the maturity dates and/or increase or decrease the lending commitments thereunder. A portion of the unused credit with banks is allocated to provide liquidity support to the revenue bonds of the traditional electric operating companies and the commercial paper programs of the Registrants, Nicor Gas, and SEGCO. The amount of variable rate revenue bonds of the traditional electric operating companies outstanding requiring liquidity support at December 31, 2022 was approximately $1.7 billion (comprised of approximately $789 million at Alabama Power, $819 million at Georgia Power, and $69 million at Mississippi Power). In addition, at December 31, 2022, Alabama Power and Georgia Power had approximately $120 million and $288 million, respectively, of fixed rate revenue bonds outstanding that are required to be remarketed within the next 12 months.

These contracts are primarily for physical electricity and natural gas purchases and sales, fuel purchases, fuel transportation and storage, energy price risk management, transmission, interest rate management, and, for Georgia Power, construction of new generation at Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4.The maximum potential collateral requirements under these contracts at December 31, 2022 were as follows:Credit RatingsSouthern Company(*)Alabama PowerGeorgia PowerMississippi PowerSouthernPower(*)Southern Company Gas(in millions)At BBB and/or Baa2$33 $1 $— $— $32 $— At BBB- and/or Baa3395 2 61 1 334 — At BB+ and/or Ba1 or below2,036 434 948 330 1,225 21 (*)Southern Power has PPAs that could require collateral, but not accelerated payment, in the event of a downgrade of Southern Power's credit. The PPAs require credit assurances without stating a specific credit rating. The amount of collateral required would depend upon actual losses resulting from a credit downgrade. Southern Power had $106 million of cash collateral posted related to PPA requirements at December 31, 2022.The amounts in the previous table for the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power include certain agreements that could require collateral if either Alabama Power or Georgia Power has a credit rating change to below investment grade. Generally, collateral may be provided by a Southern Company guaranty, letter of credit, or cash. Additionally, a credit rating downgrade could impact the ability of the Registrants to access capital markets and would be likely to impact the cost at which they do so.Mississippi Power and its largest retail customer, Chevron Products Company (Chevron), have agreements under which Mississippi Power provides retail service to the Chevron refinery in Pascagoula, Mississippi through at least 2038. The II-66 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISagreements grant Chevron a security interest in the co-generation assets owned by Mississippi Power located at the refinery that is exercisable upon the occurrence of (i) certain bankruptcy events or (ii) other events of default coupled with specific reductions in steam output at the facility and a downgrade of Mississippi Power's credit rating to below investment grade by two of the three rating agencies.On February 22, 2022, Fitch downgraded the senior unsecured long-term debt rating of Georgia Power to BBB+ from A- with a stable outlook.Also on February 22, 2022, Fitch revised the ratings outlook of Southern Company, Alabama Power, Southern Power, Nicor Gas, and SEGCO to negative from stable.On December 15, 2022, Moody's revised its rating outlook for Mississippi Power from stable to positive.Market Price RiskThe Registrants had no material change in market risk exposure for the year ended December 31, 2022 when compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. See Note 14 to the financial statements for an in-depth discussion of the Registrants' derivatives, as well as Note 1 to the financial statements under ""Financial Instruments"" for additional information.Due to cost-based rate regulation and other various cost recovery mechanisms, the traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities that sell natural gas directly to end-use customers continue to have limited exposure to market volatility in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, commodity fuel prices, and prices of electricity. The traditional electric operating companies and certain of the natural gas distribution utilities manage fuel-hedging programs implemented per the guidelines of their respective state PSCs or other applicable state regulatory agencies to hedge the impact of market fluctuations in natural gas prices for customers. Mississippi Power also manages wholesale fuel-hedging programs under agreements with its wholesale customers. Because energy from Southern Power's facilities is primarily sold under long-term PPAs with tolling agreements and provisions shifting substantially all of the responsibility for fuel cost to the counterparties, Southern Power's exposure to market volatility in commodity fuel prices and prices of electricity is generally limited. However, Southern Power has been and may continue to be exposed to market volatility in energy-related commodity prices as a result of uncontracted generating capacity. To mitigate residual risks relative to movements in electricity prices, the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power may enter into physical fixed-price contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity through the wholesale electricity market and, to a lesser extent, financial hedge contracts for natural gas purchases; however, a significant portion of contracts are priced at market.Certain of Southern Company Gas' non-regulated operations routinely utilize various types of derivative instruments to economically hedge certain commodity price and weather risks inherent in the natural gas industry. These instruments include a variety of exchange-traded and OTC energy contracts, such as forward contracts, futures contracts, options contracts, and swap agreements. Southern Company Gas' gas marketing services business also actively manages storage positions through a variety of hedging transactions for the purpose of managing exposures arising from changing natural gas prices. These hedging instruments are used to substantially protect economic margins (as spreads between wholesale and retail natural gas prices widen between periods) and thereby minimize exposure to declining earnings. Some of these economic hedge activities may not qualify, or may not be designated, for hedge accounting treatment.The following table provides information related to variable interest rate exposure on long-term debt (including amounts due within one year) at December 31, 2022 for the applicable Registrants:At December 31, 2022Southern Company(*)AlabamaPowerGeorgiaPowerMississippiPowerSouthern CompanyGas(in millions, except percentages)Long-term variable interest rate exposure$5,071 $834 $819 $269 $500 Weighted average interest rate on long-term variable interest rate exposure5.14 %3.89 %3.91 %3.88 %4.70 %Impact on annualized interest expense of 100 basis point change in interest rates$51 $8 $8 $3 $5 (*)Includes $2.550 billion of long-term variable interest rate exposure at the Southern Company parent entity, $550 million of which was redeemed subsequent to December 31, 2022.

See Note 14 to the financial statements under ""Foreign Currency Derivatives"" for additional information.Changes in fair value of energy-related derivative contracts for Southern Company and Southern Company Gas for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 are provided in the table below. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, substantially all of the traditional electric operating companies' and certain of the natural gas distribution utilities' energy-related derivative contracts were designated as regulatory hedges and were related to the applicable company's fuel-hedging program.Southern Company(a)Southern Company Gas(a)(in millions)Contracts outstanding at December 31, 2020, assets (liabilities), net$107 $101 Contracts realized or settled(252)(85)Current period changes(b)243 (84)Sale of Sequent(c)76 76 Contracts outstanding at December 31, 2021, assets (liabilities), net$174 $8 Contracts realized or settled(327)10 Current period changes(b)142 (55)Contracts outstanding at December 31, 2022, assets (liabilities), net$(11)$(37)(a)Excludes cash collateral held on deposit in broker margin accounts of $41 million, $3 million, and $28 million at December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively, and immaterial premium and intrinsic value associated with weather derivatives for all periods presented.(b)The changes in fair value of energy-related derivative contracts are substantially attributable to both the volume and the price of natural gas. Current period changes also include the changes in fair value of new contracts entered into during the period, if any.(c)As a result of the sale of Sequent on July 1, 2021, Southern Company Gas' market risk exposure decreased significantly. See Note 15 to the financial statements under ""Southern Company Gas"" for information regarding the sale of Sequent.The net hedge volumes of energy-related derivative contracts for natural gas purchased (sold) at December 31, 2022 and 2021 for Southern Company and Southern Company Gas were as follows:Southern CompanySouthern Company GasmmBtu Volume (in millions)At December 31, 2022:Commodity – Natural gas swaps217 — Commodity – Natural gas options214 93 Total hedge volume431 93 At December 31, 2021:Commodity – Natural gas swaps57 — Commodity – Natural gas options253 68 Total hedge volume310 68 Southern Company Gas' derivative contracts are comprised of both long and short natural gas positions. A long position is a contract to purchase natural gas, and a short position is a contract to sell natural gas. The volumes presented above for Southern Company Gas represent the net of long natural gas positions of 98 million mmBtu and short natural gas positions of 5 million mmBtu at December 31, 2022 and the net of long natural gas positions of 74 million mmBtu and short natural gas positions of 6 million mmBtu at December 31, 2021.For the Southern Company system, the weighted average swap contract cost per mmBtu was approximately $0.08 per mmBtu above market prices at December 31, 2022 and was approximately $0.74 per mmBtu below market prices at December 31, 2021. The change in option fair value is primarily attributable to the volatility of the market and the underlying change in the natural gas price. Substantially all of the traditional electric operating companies' natural gas hedge gains and losses are recovered through their respective fuel cost recovery clauses.II-68 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISThe Registrants use over-the-counter contracts that are not exchange traded but are fair valued using prices which are market observable, and thus fall into Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. In addition, Southern Company Gas uses exchange-traded market-observable contracts, which are categorized as Level 1. See Note 13 to the financial statements for further discussion of fair value measurements. The maturities of the energy-related derivative contracts for Southern Company and Southern Company Gas at December 31, 2022 were as follows:Fair Value Measurements of Contracts atDecember 31, 2022TotalFair ValueMaturity20232024 – 20252026 – 2027Thereafter(in millions)Southern CompanyLevel 1(a)$(14)$(11)$(3)$— $— Level 2(b)3 (11)7 2 5 Southern Company total(c)$(11)$(22)$4 $2 $5 Southern Company GasLevel 1(a)$(14)$(11)$(3)$— $— Level 2(b)(23)(23)— — — Southern Company Gas total(c)$(37)$(34)$(3)$— $— (a)Valued using NYMEX futures prices.(b)Level 2 amounts for Southern Company Gas are valued using basis transactions that represent the cost to transport natural gas from a NYMEX delivery point to the contract delivery point. These transactions are based on quotes obtained either through electronic trading platforms or directly from brokers.(c)Excludes cash collateral of $41 million as well as immaterial premium and associated intrinsic value associated with weather derivatives.The Registrants are exposed to risk in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to energy-related and interest rate derivative contracts, as applicable. The Registrants only enter into agreements and material transactions with counterparties that have investment grade credit ratings by Moody's and S&P, or with counterparties who have posted collateral to cover potential credit exposure. Therefore, the Registrants do not anticipate market risk exposure from nonperformance by the counterparties. For additional information, see Note 1 to the financial statements under ""Financial Instruments"" and Note 14 to the financial statements.Credit RiskSouthern Company (except as discussed herein), the traditional electric operating companies, and Southern Power are not exposed to any concentrations of credit risk. Southern Company Gas' exposure to concentrations of credit risk is discussed herein.Southern Company GasGas Distribution OperationsConcentration of credit risk occurs at Atlanta Gas Light for amounts billed for services and other costs to its customers, which consist of the 14 Marketers in Georgia. The credit risk exposure to the Marketers varies seasonally, with the lowest exposure in the non-peak summer months and the highest exposure in the peak winter months. Marketers are responsible for the retail sale of natural gas to end-use customers in Georgia. The provisions of Atlanta Gas Light's tariff allow Atlanta Gas Light to obtain credit security support in an amount equal to a minimum of two times a Marketer's highest month's estimated bill from Atlanta Gas Light. For 2022, the four largest Marketers based on customer count, which includes SouthStar, accounted for 13% of Southern Company Gas' operating revenues and 15% of operating revenues for Southern Company Gas' gas distribution operations segment.Several factors are designed to mitigate Southern Company Gas' risks from the increased concentration of credit that has resulted from deregulation. In addition to the security support described above, Atlanta Gas Light bills intrastate delivery service to Marketers in advance rather than in arrears. Atlanta Gas Light accepts credit support in the form of cash deposits, letters of credit/surety bonds from acceptable issuers, and corporate guarantees from investment-grade entities. Southern Company Gas reviews the adequacy of credit support coverage, credit rating profiles of credit support providers, and payment status of each Marketer. Southern Company Gas believes that adequate policies and procedures are in place to properly quantify, manage, and report on Atlanta Gas Light's credit risk exposure to Marketers.II-69 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISAtlanta Gas Light also faces potential credit risk in connection with assignments of interstate pipeline transportation and storage capacity to Marketers. Although Atlanta Gas Light assigns this capacity to Marketers, in the event that a Marketer fails to pay the interstate pipelines for the capacity, the interstate pipelines would likely seek repayment from Atlanta Gas Light.Gas Marketing ServicesSouthern Company Gas obtains credit scores for its firm residential and small commercial customers using a national credit reporting agency, enrolling only those customers that meet or exceed Southern Company Gas' credit threshold. Southern Company Gas considers potential interruptible and large commercial customers based on reviews of publicly available financial statements and commercially available credit reports. Prior to entering into a physical transaction, Southern Company Gas also assigns physical wholesale counterparties an internal credit rating and credit limit based on the counterparties' Moody's, S&P, and Fitch ratings, commercially available credit reports, and audited financial statements.II-70 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements",2023-12-30 19:50:08.120227
