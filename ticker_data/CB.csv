896159,CB,Chubb Ltd,2013,"Item 7.5Table of ContentsACE Bermuda is our original insurance company. It provides commercial insurance products on an excess basis mainly to a global client base targeting Fortune 1000 companies and covering exposures that are generally low in frequency and high in severity. ACE Bermuda offers excess liability, professional lines, excess property, and political risk, the latter being written on a subscription basis by Sovereign Risk Insurance Ltd. (Sovereign), a wholly-owned managing agent. ACE Bermuda accesses its clients primarily through the Bermuda offices of major, internationally recognized insurance brokers.The run-off operations do not actively sell insurance products, but are responsible for the management of certain existing policies and settlement of related claims.Competitive EnvironmentACE USA and ACE Westchester compete against a number of large, national carriers as well as regional competitors and other entities offering risk alternatives such as self-insured retentions and captive programs. The markets in which we compete are subject to significant cycles of fluctuating capacity and wide disparities in price adequacy. We strive to offer superior service, which we believe has differentiated us from our competitors. The ACE USA and ACE Westchester operations pursue a specialist strategy and focus on market opportunities where we can compete effectively based on service levels and product design, while still achieving an adequate level of profitability. A competitive advantage is also achieved through ACE USA's innovative product offerings and our ability to provide multiple products to a single client due to our nationwide local presence. An additional competitive strength of all our domestic commercial units is the ability to deliver global products and coverage to customers in concert with our Insurance – Overseas General segment. ACE USA has grown, in part, from the leveraging of cross-marketing opportunities with our other operations to take advantage of our organization's global presence. ACE Agriculture primarily operates in a federally regulated program where all approved providers offer the same product forms and rates through independent and/or captive agents. ACE Bermuda competes against international commercial carriers writing business on an excess of loss basis. ACE Commercial Risk Services competes against numerous insurance companies ranging from large national carriers to small and mid-size insurers who provide specialty coverages and standard P&C products. ACE Private Risk Services competes against insurance companies of varying sizes that sell products through various distribution channels, including through the Internet. Insurance – Overseas GeneralOverview The Insurance – Overseas General segment, which accounted for 37 percent of 2012 consolidated net premiums earned, comprises ACE International, our global retail insurance operations, the wholesale insurance business of ACE Global Markets (AGM), and the international A&H business of Combined Insurance. ACE International is our retail business serving clients ranging from local companies and insureds to large multinationals outside the U.S., Bermuda, and Canada. AGM, our London-based international specialty and excess and surplus lines business, includes Lloyd's of London (Lloyd's) Syndicate 2488 (Syndicate 2488), a wholly-owned ACE syndicate. ACE provides funds at Lloyd's to support underwriting by Syndicate 2488, which is managed by ACE Underwriting Agencies Limited and has an underwriting capacity of £350 million for 2013. The reinsurance operation of AGM is included in the Global Reinsurance segment. Products and DistributionACE International maintains a presence in every major insurance market in the world and is organized geographically along product lines that provide dedicated underwriting focus to customers. ACE International's P&C business is generally written, on both a direct and assumed basis, through major international, regional, and local brokers and agents. Our A&H and other consumer lines products are distributed through brokers, agents, direct marketing programs, and sponsor relationships. Certain ACE Europe branded products are also offered via an e-commerce platform, ACE Online, that allows brokers to quote, bind, and issue specialty policies online. Property insurance products include traditional commercial fire coverage as well as energy industry-related, marine, construction, and other technical coverages. Principal casualty products are commercial primary and excess casualty, environmental, and general liability. ACE International specialty coverages include D&O professional indemnity, energy, aviation, political risk and specialty personal lines products. The A&H operations primarily offer personal accident and supplemental medical products to meet the insurance needs of individuals and groups outside of U.S. insurance markets. These coverages include accidental death, business/holiday travel, specified disease, disability, medical and hospital indemnity, and income protection coverages. We are not in the primary health care business. With respect to our supplemental medical and hospital indemnity products, we typically pay fixed amounts for claims and are therefore insulated from rising health care costs. ACE International's personal lines operations provide specialty products and services designed to meet the needs of specific target markets and include property damage, automobile, homeowners, and personal liability.6Table of ContentsThe following is a discussion of ACE International's areas of operations: ACE Europe, ACE Asia Pacific, ACE Far East, and ACE Latin America.•ACE Europe is headquartered in London and offers a broad range of P&C, A&H, and specialty coverages throughout the European Union, Central and Eastern Europe, the Commonwealth of Independent States, the Middle East, North Africa, and South Africa. ACE's operations in these regions comprise both insurance subsidiaries and joint ventures. •ACE Asia Pacific is headquartered in Singapore and has an extensive network of operations offering a broad range of P&C, A&H, and specialty coverages principally directed at large and mid-sized corporations as well as individual consumers. This region also provides management, underwriting, reinsurance protection and administrative support to our equity investee, Huatai Insurance Company of China, Limited.•ACE Far East is based in Tokyo and offers a broad range of P&C, A&H, and personal lines insurance products and services to businesses and consumers in Japan, principally delivered through an extensive agency network. •ACE Latin America includes business operations throughout Latin America and the Caribbean, focusing on P&C, A&H, and specialty personal lines insurance products and services to both large and small commercial clients as well as individual consumers. AGM offers products through its parallel distribution network via ACE European Group Limited (AEGL) and Syndicate 2488. AGM uses Syndicate 2488 to underwrite P&C business on a global basis through Lloyd's worldwide licenses. AGM uses AEGL to underwrite similar classes of business through its network of U.K. and European licenses, and in the U.S. where it is eligible to write excess and surplus lines business. Factors influencing the decision to place business with Syndicate 2488 or AEGL include licensing eligibilities, capitalization requirements, and client/broker preference. All business underwritten by AGM is accessed through registered brokers. The main lines of business include aviation, property, energy, professional lines, marine, political risk, and A&H. Combined Insurance uses an international sales force of independent contractor agents to distribute a wide range of supplemental A&H products, including personal accident, short-term disability, critical conditions and cancer aid, and hospital confinement/recovery. Most of these products are primarily fixed-indemnity obligations and are not subject to escalating medical cost inflation.Competitive EnvironmentACE International's primary competitors include U.S.-based companies with global operations, as well as non-U.S. global carriers and indigenous companies in regional and local markets. For the A&H lines of business, including those offered by Combined Insurance, locally-based competitors include financial institutions and bank-owned insurance subsidiaries. Our international operations have the distinct advantage of being part of one of the few international insurance groups with a global network of licensed companies able to write policies on a locally admitted basis. The principal competitive factors that affect the international operations are underwriting expertise and pricing, relative operating efficiency, product differentiation, producer relations, and the quality of policyholder services. A competitive strength of our international operations is our global network and breadth of insurance programs, which assist individuals and business organizations to meet their risk management objectives, while also giving us the advantage of accessing local technical expertise, accomplishing a spread of risk, and offering a global network to service multinational accounts.AGM is one of the preeminent international specialty insurers in London and is an established lead underwriter on a significant portion of the risks underwritten for all lines of business. This leadership position allows AGM to set the policy terms and conditions of many of the policies written. All lines of business face competition, depending on the business class, from Lloyd's syndicates, the London market, and other major international insurers and reinsurers. Competition for international risks is also seen from domestic insurers in the country of origin of the insured. AGM differentiates itself from competitors through long standing experience in its product lines, its multiple insurance entities (Syndicate 2488 and AEGL), and the quality of its underwriting and claims service.7Table of ContentsGlobal Reinsurance OverviewThe Global Reinsurance segment, which accounted for six percent of 2012 consolidated net premiums earned, represents ACE's reinsurance operations comprising ACE Tempest Re Bermuda, ACE Tempest Re USA, ACE Tempest Re International, and ACE Tempest Re Canada. The Global Reinsurance segment also includes AGM's reinsurance operations. Global Reinsurance markets its reinsurance products worldwide under the ACE Tempest Re brand name and provides solutions for small to mid-sized clients and multinational ceding companies including licensed reinsurance capabilities, property and workers' compensation catastrophe, loss-warranty, stop-loss cover, marine and aviation programs. Products and DistributionGlobal Reinsurance services clients globally through its major units. Major international brokers submit business to one or more of these units' underwriting teams who have built strong relationships with both key brokers and clients by providing a responsive, client-focused approach to risk assessment and pricing.ACE Tempest Re Bermuda principally provides property catastrophe reinsurance on an excess of loss basis globally to insurers of commercial and personal property. Property catastrophe reinsurance is on an occurrence basis and protects a ceding company against an accumulation of losses covered by its issued insurance policies, arising from a common event or occurrence. ACE Tempest Re Bermuda underwrites reinsurance principally on an excess of loss basis, meaning that its exposure only arises after the ceding company's accumulated losses have exceeded the attachment point of the reinsurance policy. ACE Tempest Re Bermuda also writes other types of reinsurance on a limited basis for selected clients. Examples include proportional property where the reinsurer shares a proportional part of the premiums and losses of the ceding company and per risk excess of loss treaty reinsurance where coverage applies on a per risk basis rather than per event or aggregate basis, together with casualty and specialty lines (catastrophe workers' compensation, crop and terrorism). ACE Tempest Re Bermuda's business is produced through reinsurance intermediaries.ACE Tempest Re USA writes all lines of traditional and specialty P&C reinsurance, and surety and fidelity reinsurance for the North American market, principally on a treaty basis, with a focus on writing property per risk and casualty reinsurance. ACE Tempest Re USA underwrites reinsurance on both a proportional and excess of loss basis. This unit's diversified portfolio is produced through reinsurance intermediaries.ACE Tempest Re International provides traditional and specialty P&C reinsurance to insurance companies worldwide, with emphasis on non-U.S. and Canadian risks. ACE Tempest Re International writes all lines of traditional and specialty reinsurance including property risk and property catastrophe, casualty, marine, aviation, and specialty through our London- and Zurich-based divisions. The London-based divisions of ACE Tempest Re International focus on the development of business sourced through London market brokers and, consequently, write a diverse book of international business using Syndicate 2488 and AEGL. The Zurich-based division focuses on providing reinsurance to continental European insurers via continental European brokers. ACE Tempest Re International also includes our Shanghai, China office which provides reinsurance coverage for Chinese-based risks and our Sao Paulo, Brazil office which provides reinsurance for Brazilian-based risks. ACE Tempest Re International underwrites reinsurance on both a proportional and excess of loss basis.ACE Tempest Re Canada offers a full array of traditional and specialty P&C reinsurance to the Canadian market, including casualty, property risk and property catastrophe. ACE Tempest Re Canada provides its coverage through its Canadian company platform and also offers clients access to Syndicate 2488. ACE Tempest Re Canada underwrites reinsurance on both a proportional and excess of loss basis.Competitive EnvironmentThe Global Reinsurance segment competes worldwide with major U.S. and non-U.S. reinsurers as well as reinsurance departments of numerous multi-line insurance organizations. Over the last several years, capital markets participants have developed financial products intended to compete with traditional reinsurance. In addition, government sponsored or backed catastrophe funds can affect demand for reinsurance. Global Reinsurance is considered a lead reinsurer and is typically involved in the negotiation and quotation of the terms and conditions of the majority of the contracts in which it participates. Global Reinsurance competes effectively in P&C markets worldwide because of its strong capital position, analytical capabilities and quality service provided to customers, the leading role it plays in setting the terms, pricing, and conditions in negotiating contracts, and its customized approach to risk selection. The key competitors in our markets vary by geographic region and product line. An advantage of our international platform is that we are able to change our mix of business in response to 8Table of Contentschanges in competitive conditions in the territories in which we operate. Our geographic reach is also sought by multinational ceding companies since all of our offices, with the exception of Bermuda, provide local reinsurance license capabilities which benefit our clients in dealing with country regulators. Life OverviewThe Life segment, which accounted for 12 percent of 2012 consolidated net premiums earned, includes ACE's international life operations (ACE Life), ACE Tempest Life Re (ACE Life Re), and the North American supplemental A&H and life business of Combined Insurance. Products and DistributionACE Life provides individual life and group benefit insurance primarily in emerging markets, including Egypt, Hong Kong, Indonesia, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, and Vietnam; also throughout Latin America, selectively in Europe, and in China through a non-consolidated joint venture insurance company. ACE Life offers a broad portfolio of protection and savings products including whole life, endowment plans, individual term life, group term life, group medical, personal accident, credit life, universal life, and unit linked contracts. The policies written by ACE Life generally provide funds to beneficiaries of insureds after death and/or protection and/or savings benefits while the contract owner is living. ACE Life sells to consumers through a variety of distribution channels including agency, bancassurance, worksite marketing, retailers, brokers, and direct to consumer marketing. We continue to expand this business with a focus on opportunities in emerging markets that we believe will result in strong and sustainable operating profits as well as a favorable return on capital commitments over time. Our dedicated agency distribution channel, whereby agents sell ACE Life products exclusively, enables us to maintain direct contact with the individual consumer, promote quality sales practices, and exercise greater control over the future of the business. ACE Life is developing agency distribution in those countries in which we believe we can achieve sustainable growth as well as a favorable return on our investment from that channel. We have developed a substantial sales force of agents principally located in our Asia-Pacific countries. ACE maintains approximately 35.8 percent direct and indirect ownership interest in Huatai Life Insurance Co., Ltd. (Huatai Life), which commenced operations in 2005 and has since grown to become one of the largest life insurance foreign joint ventures in China. Huatai Life offers a broad portfolio of insurance products through a variety of distribution channels including approximately 310 licensed sales locations in 13 provinces within China. ACE Life Re's core business is a Bermuda-based operation which provides reinsurance to primary life insurers, focusing on guarantees included in certain fixed and variable annuity products and also on more traditional mortality reinsurance protection. ACE Life Re's U.S.-based traditional life reinsurance operation was discontinued for new business in January 2010. Since 2007, ACE Life Re has not quoted on new opportunities in the variable annuity reinsurance marketplace and our focus has been on successfully managing the current portfolio of risk, both in the aggregate and on a contract basis. This business is managed with a long-term perspective and short-term earnings volatility is expected. Combined Insurance distributes specialty supplemental A&H and life insurance products targeted to middle income consumers, businesses, and students through educational institutions in the U.S. and Canada. Combined Insurance's substantial North American sales force distributes a wide range of supplemental accident and sickness insurance products, including personal accident, short-term disability, critical illness, Medicare supplement products, and hospital confinement/recovery. Most of these products are primarily fixed-indemnity benefit obligations and are not subject to escalating medical cost inflation.Competitive EnvironmentACE Life's competition differs by location but generally includes multinational insurers, and in some locations, local insurers, joint ventures, or state-owned insurers. ACE's financial strength and reputation as an entrepreneurial organization with a global presence gives ACE Life a strong base from which to compete. While ACE Life Re is not currently quoting on new opportunities in the variable annuity reinsurance marketplace, we continue to monitor developments in this market. Combined Insurance competes for A&H business in the U.S. against numerous A&H and life insurance companies across various industry segments. ____________________________________________________________________________________________________________UnderwritingACE is an underwriting company and we strive to emphasize quality of underwriting rather than volume of business or market share. Our underwriting strategy is to manage risk by employing consistent, disciplined pricing and risk selection. This, coupled with our holdings of less cyclical product lines, has helped us develop flexibility and stability of our business, and has allowed us to maintain a profitable book of business throughout market cycles. Clearly defined underwriting authorities, standards, and guidelines coupled with a strong underwriting audit function are in place in each of our local operations and global profit centers. Global product boards ensure consistency of approach and the establishment of best practices throughout 9Table of Contentsthe world. Our priority is to help ensure adherence to criteria for risk selection by maintaining high levels of experience and expertise in our underwriting staff. In addition, we employ a business review structure that helps ensure control of risk quality and conservative use of policy limits and terms and conditions. Underwriting discipline is at the heart of our operating philosophy.Qualified actuaries in each region work closely with the underwriting teams to provide additional expertise in the underwriting process. We use sophisticated catastrophe loss and risk modeling techniques designed to ensure appropriate spread of risk and to analyze correlation of risk across different product lines and territories. This helps to ensure that losses are contained within our risk tolerance and appetite for individual product lines, businesses, and ACE as a whole. We also purchase reinsurance as a tool to diversify risk and limit the net loss potential of catastrophes and large or unusually hazardous risks.

Certain ACE Europe branded products are also offered via an e-commerce platform, ACE Online, that allows brokers to quote, bind, and issue specialty policies online. Property insurance products include traditional commercial fire coverage as well as energy industry-related, marine, construction, and other technical coverages. Principal casualty products are commercial primary and excess casualty, environmental, and general liability. A&H and other consumer lines products are distributed through brokers, agents, direct marketing programs, and sponsor relationships. ACE International specialty coverages include D&O, professional indemnity, energy, aviation, political risk, and specialty personal lines products. The A&H operations primarily offer personal accident and supplemental medical coverages including accidental death, business/holiday travel, specified disease, disability, medical and hospital indemnity, and income protection. We are not in the primary health care business. With respect to our supplemental medical and hospital indemnity products, we typically pay fixed amounts for claims and are therefore largely insulated from the direct impact of rising health care costs. ACE International's personal lines operations provide specialty products and services designed to meet the needs of specific target markets and include property damage, automobile, homeowners, and personal liability.AGM offers products through its parallel distribution network via ACE European Group Limited (AEGL) and Syndicate 2488. AGM uses Syndicate 2488 to underwrite P&C business on a global basis through Lloyd's worldwide licenses. AGM uses AEGL to underwrite similar classes of business through its network of U.K. and European licenses, and in the U.S. where it is eligible to write excess and surplus lines business. Factors influencing the decision to place business with Syndicate 2488 or AEGL include licensing eligibilities, capitalization requirements, and client/broker preference. All business underwritten by AGM is accessed through registered brokers. The main lines of business include aviation, property, energy, professional lines, marine, financial lines, political risk, and A&H.Combined Insurance uses an international sales force to distribute a wide range of supplemental A&H products including personal accident, short-term disability, critical conditions and cancer aid, and hospital confinement/recovery. Most of these products are primarily fixed-indemnity obligations and are not subject directly to escalating medical cost inflation.Competitive EnvironmentACE International's primary competitors include U.S.-based companies with global operations, as well as non-U.S. global carriers and indigenous companies in regional and local markets. For the A&H lines of business, including those offered by Combined Insurance, locally-based competitors include financial institutions and bank-owned insurance subsidiaries. Our international operations have the distinct advantage of being part of one of the few international insurance groups with a global network of licensed companies able to write policies on a locally admitted basis. The principal competitive factors that affect the international operations are underwriting expertise and pricing, relative operating efficiency, product differentiation, producer relations, and the quality of policyholder services. A competitive strength of our international operations is our global network and breadth of insurance programs, which assist individuals and business organizations to meet their risk management 6Table of Contentsobjectives, while also giving us the advantage of accessing local technical expertise, accomplishing a spread of risk, and offering a global network to service multinational accounts.AGM is one of the preeminent international specialty insurers in London and is an established lead underwriter on a significant portion of the risks it underwrites for all lines of business. This leadership position allows AGM to set the policy terms and conditions of many of the policies written. All lines of business face competition, depending on the business class, from Lloyd's syndicates, the London market, and other major international insurers and reinsurers. Competition for international risks is also seen from domestic insurers in the country of origin of the insured. AGM differentiates itself from competitors through long standing experience in its product lines, its multiple insurance entities (Syndicate 2488 and AEGL), and the quality of its underwriting and claims service.Global Reinsurance (6 percent of 2014 Consolidated NPE)OverviewThe Global Reinsurance segment represents ACE's reinsurance operations comprising ACE Tempest Re Bermuda, ACE Tempest Re USA, ACE Tempest Re International, and ACE Tempest Re Canada. The Global Reinsurance segment also includes AGM's reinsurance operations. Global Reinsurance markets reinsurance products worldwide under the ACE Tempest Re brand name and provides solutions for small to mid-sized clients and multinational ceding companies including licensed reinsurance capabilities, property and workers' compensation catastrophe, loss-warranty, stop-loss cover, marine and aviation programs. Products and DistributionGlobal Reinsurance services clients globally through its major units. Major international brokers submit business to one or more of these units' underwriting teams who have built strong relationships with both key brokers and clients by providing a responsive, client-focused approach to risk assessment and pricing.ACE Tempest Re Bermuda principally provides property catastrophe reinsurance on an excess of loss basis globally to insurers of commercial and personal property. Property catastrophe reinsurance is on an occurrence basis and protects a ceding company against an accumulation of losses covered by its issued insurance policies, arising from a common event or occurrence. ACE Tempest Re Bermuda underwrites reinsurance principally on an excess of loss basis, meaning that its exposure only arises after the ceding company's accumulated losses have exceeded the attachment point of the reinsurance policy. ACE Tempest Re Bermuda also writes other types of reinsurance on a limited basis for selected clients. Examples include proportional property where the reinsurer shares a proportional part of the premiums and losses of the ceding company and per risk excess of loss treaty reinsurance where coverage applies on a per risk basis rather than per event or aggregate basis, together with casualty (catastrophe workers' compensation) and specialty lines (crop and terrorism). ACE Tempest Re Bermuda's business is produced through reinsurance intermediaries.ACE Tempest Re USA writes all lines of traditional and specialty P&C reinsurance, and surety and fidelity reinsurance for the North American market, principally on a treaty basis, with a focus on writing property per risk and casualty reinsurance. ACE Tempest Re USA underwrites reinsurance on both a proportional and excess of loss basis. This unit's diversified portfolio is produced through reinsurance intermediaries.ACE Tempest Re International provides traditional and specialty P&C reinsurance to insurance companies worldwide, with emphasis on non-U.S. and Canadian risks. ACE Tempest Re International writes all lines of traditional and specialty reinsurance including property risk and property catastrophe, casualty, marine, aviation, and specialty through our London- and Zurich-based divisions. The London-based divisions of ACE Tempest Re International focus on the development of business sourced through London market brokers and, consequently, write a diverse book of international business using Syndicate 2488 and AEGL. The Zurich-based division focuses on providing reinsurance to continental European insurers via continental European brokers while also serving Asian and Latin American markets. ACE Tempest Re International also includes our Shanghai, China office which provides reinsurance coverage for Chinese-based risks. ACE Tempest Re International underwrites reinsurance on both a proportional and excess of loss basis.ACE Tempest Re Canada offers a full array of traditional and specialty P&C, and Surety reinsurance to the Canadian market, including casualty, property risk and property catastrophe. ACE Tempest Re Canada provides coverage through its Canadian company platform and also offers clients access to Syndicate 2488. ACE Tempest Re Canada underwrites reinsurance on both a proportional and excess of loss basis.7Table of ContentsCompetitive EnvironmentThe Global Reinsurance segment competes worldwide with major U.S. and non-U.S. reinsurers as well as reinsurance departments of numerous multi-line insurance organizations. In addition, over the last several years, capital markets participants have developed financial products intended to compete with traditional reinsurance. Additionally, government sponsored or backed catastrophe funds can affect demand for reinsurance. Global Reinsurance is considered a lead reinsurer and is typically involved in the negotiation and quotation of the terms and conditions of the majority of the contracts in which it participates. Global Reinsurance competes effectively in P&C markets worldwide because of its strong capital position, analytical capabilities and quality customer service, the leading role it plays in setting the terms, pricing, and conditions in negotiating contracts, and its customized approach to risk selection. The key competitors in our markets vary by geographic region and product line. An advantage of our international platform is that we are able to change our mix of business in response to changes in competitive conditions in the territories in which we operate. Our geographic reach is also sought by multinational ceding companies since all of our offices, with the exception of Bermuda, provide local reinsurance license capabilities which benefit our clients in dealing with country regulators. Life (11 percent of 2014 Consolidated NPE)OverviewThe Life segment comprises ACE's international life operations (ACE Life), ACE Tempest Life Re (ACE Life Re), and the North American supplemental A&H and life business of Combined Insurance. Products and DistributionACE Life provides individual life and group benefit insurance primarily in emerging markets, including Egypt, Hong Kong, Indonesia, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, and Vietnam; also throughout Latin America; selectively in Europe; and in China through a non-consolidated joint venture insurance company. ACE Life offers a broad portfolio of protection and savings products including whole life, endowment plans, individual term life, group term life, group medical, personal accident, credit life, universal life, and unit linked contracts. The policies written by ACE Life generally provide funds to beneficiaries of insureds after death and/or protection and/or savings benefits while the contract owner is living. ACE Life sells to consumers through a variety of distribution channels including agency, bancassurance, worksite marketing, retailers, brokers, and direct to consumer marketing. We continue to expand ACE Life with a focus on opportunities in emerging markets that we believe will result in strong and sustainable operating profits as well as a favorable return on capital commitments over time. Our dedicated agency distribution channel, whereby agents sell ACE Life products exclusively, enables us to maintain direct contact with the individual consumer, promote quality sales practices, and exercise greater control over the future of the business. We have developed a substantial sales force of agents principally located in our Asia-Pacific countries. ACE also maintains approximately 35.9 percent direct and indirect ownership interest in Huatai Life Insurance Co., Ltd. (Huatai Life), which commenced operations in 2005 and has since grown to become one of the largest life insurance foreign joint ventures in China. Huatai Life offers a broad portfolio of insurance products through a variety of distribution channels including approximately 277 licensed sales locations in 14 Chinese provinces. ACE Life Re's core business is a Bermuda-based operation which provides reinsurance to primary life insurers, focusing on guarantees included in certain fixed and variable annuity products and also on more traditional mortality reinsurance protection. ACE Life Re's U.S.-based traditional life reinsurance operation was discontinued for new business in January 2010. Since 2007, ACE Life Re has not quoted on new opportunities in the variable annuity reinsurance marketplace and our focus has been on managing the current portfolio of risk, both in the aggregate and on a contract basis. This business is managed with a long-term perspective and short-term earnings volatility is expected. Combined Insurance distributes specialty supplemental A&H and life insurance products targeted to middle income consumers and businesses in the U.S. and Canada. Combined Insurance's substantial North American sales force distributes a wide range of supplemental accident and sickness insurance products, including personal accident, short-term disability, critical illness, Medicare supplement products, and hospital confinement/recovery. Most of these products are primarily fixed-indemnity benefit obligations and are not directly subject to escalating medical cost inflation.Competitive EnvironmentACE Life's competition differs by location but generally includes multinational insurers, and in some locations, local insurers, joint ventures, or state-owned insurers. ACE's financial strength and reputation as an entrepreneurial organization with a global presence gives ACE Life a strong base from which to compete. While ACE Life Re is not currently quoting on new opportunities in the variable annuity reinsurance marketplace, we continue to monitor developments in this market. Combined Insurance competes for A&H business in the U.S. against numerous A&H and life insurance companies across various industry segments. 8Table of Contents____________________________________________________________________________________________________________UnderwritingACE is an underwriting company and we strive to emphasize quality of underwriting rather than volume of business or market share. Our underwriting strategy is to manage risk by employing consistent, disciplined pricing and risk selection. This, coupled with writing a number of less cyclical product lines, has helped us develop flexibility and stability of our business, and has allowed us to maintain a profitable book of business throughout market cycles. Clearly defined underwriting authorities, standards, and guidelines coupled with a strong underwriting audit function are in place in each of our local operations and global profit centers. Global product boards ensure consistency of approach and the establishment of best practices throughout the world. Our priority is to help ensure adherence to criteria for risk selection by maintaining high levels of experience and expertise in our underwriting staff. In addition, we employ a business review structure that helps ensure control of risk quality and conservative use of policy limits and terms and conditions. Underwriting discipline is at the heart of our operating philosophy.Qualified actuaries in each region work closely with the underwriting teams to provide additional expertise in the underwriting process. We use internal and external data together with sophisticated analytical, catastrophe loss and risk modeling techniques to ensure an appropriate understanding of risk, including diversification and correlation effects, across different product lines and territories. This helps to ensure that losses are contained within our risk tolerance and appetite for individual product lines, businesses, and ACE as a whole. We also purchase protection from third parties, including, but not limited to, reinsurance as a tool to diversify risk and limit the net loss potential of catastrophes and large or unusually hazardous risks.

Chubb Tempest Re Bermuda also writes other types of reinsurance on a limited basis for selected clients. Examples include proportional property where the reinsurer shares a proportional part of the premiums and losses of the ceding company and per risk excess of loss treaty reinsurance where coverage applies on a per risk basis rather than per event or aggregate basis, together with casualty (catastrophe workers' compensation) and specialty lines (crop and terrorism). Chubb Tempest Re Bermuda's business is produced through reinsurance intermediaries.Chubb Tempest Re USA writes all lines of traditional and specialty P&C reinsurance, and surety and fidelity reinsurance for the North American market, principally on a treaty basis, with a focus on writing property per risk and casualty reinsurance.

In addition, over the last several years, capital markets participants have developed financial products intended to compete with traditional reinsurance. Additionally, government sponsored or backed catastrophe funds can affect demand for reinsurance. Global Reinsurance is considered a lead reinsurer and is typically involved in the negotiation and quotation of the terms and conditions of the majority of the contracts in which it participates. Global Reinsurance competes effectively in P&C markets worldwide because of its strong capital position, analytical capabilities and quality customer service, the leading role it plays in setting the terms, pricing, and conditions in negotiating contracts, and its customized approach to risk selection. The key competitors in our markets vary by geographic region and product line. An advantage of our international platform is that we are able to change our mix of business in response to changes in competitive conditions in the territories in which we operate. Our geographic reach is also sought by multinational ceding companies since all of our offices, with the exception of Bermuda, provide local reinsurance license capabilities which benefit our clients in dealing with country regulators.8Table of ContentsLife Insurance (7 percent of 2016 Consolidated NPE)OverviewThe Life segment comprises Chubb's international life operations (Chubb Life), Chubb Tempest Life Re (Chubb Life Re), and the North American supplemental A&H and life business of Combined Insurance.Products and DistributionChubb Life provides individual life and group benefit insurance primarily in emerging markets, including Hong Kong, Indonesia, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, Vietnam, and Egypt; also throughout Latin America; selectively in Europe; and in China through a non-consolidated joint venture insurance company. Chubb Life offers a broad portfolio of protection and savings products including whole life, endowment plans, individual term life, group term life, medical and health, personal accident, credit life, universal life, and unit linked contracts. The policies written by Chubb Life generally provide funds to beneficiaries of insureds after death and/or protection and/or savings benefits while the contract owner is living. Chubb Life sells to consumers through a variety of distribution channels including captive and independent agency, bancassurance, worksite marketing, retailers, brokers, and direct to consumer marketing. We continue to expand Chubb Life with a focus on opportunities in emerging markets that we believe will result in strong and sustainable operating profits as well as a favorable return on capital commitments over time. Our dedicated captive agency distribution channel, whereby agents sell Chubb Life products exclusively, enables us to maintain direct contact with the individual consumer, promote quality sales practices, and exercise greater control over the future of the business. We have developed a substantial sales force of agents principally located in our Asia-Pacific countries. Chubb also maintains approximately 36 percent direct and indirect ownership interest in Huatai Life Insurance Co., Ltd. (Huatai Life), which commenced operations in 2005 and has since grown to become one of the larger life insurance foreign joint ventures in China. Huatai Life offers a broad portfolio of insurance products through a variety of distribution channels including approximately 333 licensed sales locations in 16 Chinese provinces.Chubb Life Re's core business is a Bermuda-based operation which provides reinsurance to primary life insurers, focusing on guarantees included in certain fixed and variable annuity products and also on more traditional mortality reinsurance protection. Chubb Life Re's U.S.-based traditional life reinsurance operation was discontinued for new business in January 2010. Since 2007, Chubb Life Re has not quoted on new opportunities in the variable annuity reinsurance marketplace and our focus has been on managing the current portfolio of risk, both in the aggregate and on a contract basis. This business is managed with a long-term perspective and short-term earnings volatility is expected.Combined Insurance distributes specialty supplemental A&H and life insurance products targeted to middle income consumers and businesses in the U.S. and Canada. Combined Insurance's substantial North American sales force distributes a wide range of supplemental accident and sickness insurance products, including personal accident, short-term disability, critical illness, Medicare supplement products, and hospital confinement/recovery. Most of these products are primarily fixed-indemnity benefit obligations and are not directly subject to escalating medical cost inflation.Competitive EnvironmentChubb Life's competition differs by location but generally includes multinational insurers, and in some locations, local insurers, joint ventures, or state-owned insurers. Chubb's financial strength and reputation as an entrepreneurial organization with a global presence gives Chubb Life a strong base from which to compete. While Chubb Life Re is not currently quoting on new opportunities in the variable annuity reinsurance marketplace, we continue to monitor developments in this market. Combined Insurance competes for A&H business in the U.S. against numerous A&H and life insurance companies across various industry segments.CorporateOverviewCorporate results primarily include loss and loss expenses of asbestos and environmental (A&E) liabilities and certain other run-off exposures, income and expenses not attributable to reportable segments and the results of our non-insurance companies. The run-off operations do not actively sell insurance products, but are responsible for the management of existing policies and settlement of related claims.Our exposure to A&E claims principally arises out of liabilities acquired when we purchased Westchester Specialty in 1998, CIGNA’s P&C business in 1999, and legacy Chubb Corp A&E claims in 2016. The A&E liabilities principally relate to claims arising from bodily-injury claims related to asbestos products and remediation costs associated with hazardous waste sites. 9Table of Contents UnderwritingChubb is an underwriting company and we strive to emphasize quality of underwriting rather than volume of business or market share. Our underwriting strategy is to manage risk by employing consistent, disciplined pricing and risk selection. This, coupled with writing a number of less cyclical product lines, has helped us develop flexibility and stability of our business, and has allowed us to maintain a profitable book of business throughout market cycles. Clearly defined underwriting authorities, standards, and guidelines coupled with a strong underwriting audit function are in place in each of our local operations and global profit centers. Global product boards ensure consistency of approach and the establishment of best practices throughout the world. Our priority is to help ensure adherence to criteria for risk selection by maintaining high levels of experience and expertise in our underwriting staff. In addition, we employ a business review structure that helps ensure control of risk quality and conservative use of policy limits and terms and conditions. Underwriting discipline is at the heart of our operating philosophy.Actuaries in each region work closely with the underwriting teams to provide additional expertise in the underwriting process. We use internal and external data together with sophisticated analytical, catastrophe loss and risk modeling techniques to ensure an appropriate understanding of risk, including diversification and correlation effects, across different product lines and territories. This helps to ensure that losses are contained within our risk tolerance and appetite for individual product lines, businesses, and Chubb as a whole. Our use of such tools and data also reflects an understanding of their inherent limitations and uncertainties. We also purchase protection from third parties, including, but not limited to, reinsurance as a tool to diversify risk and limit the net loss potential of catastrophes and large or unusually hazardous risks.

CGM, our London-based international specialty and excess and surplus lines business, includes Lloyd's of London (Lloyd's) Syndicate 2488, a wholly-owned Chubb syndicate supported by funds at Lloyd’s provided by Chubb Corporate Members. Syndicate 2488 has an underwriting capacity of £405 million for the Lloyd’s 2018 year of account. The syndicate is managed by Chubb’s Lloyd’s managing agency, ACE Underwriting Agencies Limited.Products and DistributionChubb International maintains a presence in every major insurance market in the world and is organized geographically along product lines as follows: Europe, Asia Pacific, Eurasia and Africa, Far East, and Latin America. Products offered include P&C, A&H, specialty coverages, and personal lines insurance products and services. Chubb International's P&C business is generally written, on both a direct and assumed basis, through major international, regional, and local brokers and agents. Certain European branded products are also offered via a digital-commerce platform, Chubb Online, that allows brokers to quote, bind, and issue specialty policies online. Property insurance products include traditional commercial fire coverage as well as energy industry-related, marine, construction, and other technical coverages. Principal casualty products are commercial primary and excess casualty, environmental, and general liability. A&H and other consumer lines products are distributed through brokers, agents, direct marketing programs, and sponsor relationships. The A&H operations primarily offer personal accident and supplemental medical coverages including accidental death, business/holiday travel, specified disease, disability, medical and hospital indemnity, and income protection. We are not in the primary healthcare business. With respect to our supplemental medical and hospital indemnity products, we typically pay fixed amounts for claims and are therefore largely insulated from the direct impact of rising healthcare costs. Chubb International specialty coverages include D&O, professional indemnity, energy, aviation, political risk, and specialty personal lines products. Chubb International's personal lines operations provide specialty products and services designed to meet the needs of specific target markets and include property damage, automobile, homeowners, and personal liability.CGM offers products through its parallel distribution network via two legal entities, Chubb European Group Limited (CEGL) and Chubb Underwriting Agencies Limited, managing agent of Syndicate 2488. CGM uses the syndicate to underwrite P&C business on a global basis through Lloyd's worldwide licenses. CGM uses CEGL to underwrite similar classes of business through its network of U.K. and European licenses, and in the U.S. where it is eligible to write excess and surplus lines business. Factors influencing the decision to place business with the syndicate or CEGL include licensing eligibilities, capitalization requirements, and client/broker preference. All business underwritten by CGM is accessed through registered brokers. The main lines of business include aviation, property, energy, professional lines, marine, financial lines, political risk, and A&H.Competitive EnvironmentChubb International's primary competitors include U.S.-based companies with global operations, as well as non-U.S. global carriers and indigenous companies in regional and local markets. For the A&H lines of business, locally based competitors also include financial institutions and bank owned insurance subsidiaries. Our international operations have the distinct advantage of being part of one of the few international insurance groups with a global network of licensed companies able to write policies on a locally admitted basis. The principal competitive factors that affect the international operations are underwriting expertise and pricing, relative operating efficiency, product differentiation, producer relations, and the quality of policyholder services. A competitive strength of our international operations is our global network and breadth of insurance programs, which assist individuals and business organizations to meet their risk management objectives, while also giving us the advantage of accessing local technical expertise, accomplishing a spread of risk, and offering a global network to service multinational accounts.CGM is one of the preeminent international specialty insurers in London and is an established lead underwriter on a significant portion of the risks it underwrites for all lines of business. This leadership position allows CGM to set the policy terms and conditions of many of the policies written. All lines of business face competition, depending on the business class, from Lloyd's syndicates, the London market, and other major international insurers and reinsurers. Competition for international risks is also seen from domestic insurers in the country of origin of the insured. CGM differentiates itself from competitors through long standing experience in its product lines, its multiple insurance entities (Syndicate 2488 and CEGL), and the quality of its underwriting and claims service.7Table of ContentsGlobal Reinsurance (2 percent of 2017 Consolidated NPE)OverviewThe Global Reinsurance segment represents Chubb's reinsurance operations comprising Chubb Tempest Re Bermuda, Chubb Tempest Re USA, Chubb Tempest Re International, and Chubb Tempest Re Canada.

An advantage of our international platform is that we are able to change our mix of business in response to changes in competitive conditions in the territories in which we operate. Our geographic reach is also sought by multinational ceding companies since all of our offices, with the exception of Bermuda, provide local reinsurance license capabilities which benefit our clients in dealing with country regulators.Life Insurance (7 percent of 2018 Consolidated NPE)OverviewThe Life segment comprises Chubb's international life operations (Chubb Life), Chubb Tempest Life Re (Chubb Life Re), and the North American supplemental A&H and life business of Combined Insurance.Products and DistributionChubb Life provides individual life and group benefit insurance primarily in developing markets, including Hong Kong, Indonesia, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, Vietnam, and Egypt; also throughout Latin America; selectively in Europe; and in China through a non-consolidated joint venture insurance company.

Chubb Life sells to consumers through a variety of distribution channels including captive and independent agencies, bancassurance, worksite marketing, retailers, brokers, telemarketing, mobilassurance, and direct to consumer marketing. We continue to expand Chubb Life with a focus on opportunities in developing markets that we believe will result in strong and sustainable operating profits as well as a favorable return on capital commitments over time. Our dedicated captive agency distribution channel, whereby agents sell Chubb Life products exclusively, enables us to maintain direct contact with the individual consumer, promote quality sales practices, and exercise greater control over the future of the business. We have developed a substantial sales force of agents principally located in our Asia-Pacific countries. Chubb also maintains approximately 36 percent direct and indirect ownership interest in Huatai Life Insurance Co., Ltd. (Huatai Life), which commenced operations in 2005 and has since grown to become one of the larger life insurance foreign joint ventures in China. Huatai Life offers a broad portfolio of insurance products through a variety of distribution channels including approximately 450 licensed sales locations in 19 Chinese provinces.Chubb Life Re's core business is a Bermuda-based operation which provides reinsurance to primary life insurers, focusing on guarantees included in certain variable annuity products and also on more traditional mortality reinsurance protection. Chubb Life Re's U.S.-based traditional life reinsurance operation was discontinued for new business in January 2010. Since 2007, Chubb Life Re has not quoted on new opportunities in the variable annuity reinsurance marketplace and our focus has been on managing the current portfolio of risk, both in the aggregate and on a contract basis. This business is managed with a long-term perspective and short-term earnings volatility is expected.Combined Insurance distributes specialty supplemental A&H and life insurance products targeted to middle income consumers and businesses in the U.S. and Canada. Combined Insurance's substantial North American sales force distributes a wide range of supplemental accident and sickness insurance products, including personal accident, short-term disability, critical illness, Medicare supplement products, and hospital confinement/recovery. Most of these products are primarily fixed-indemnity benefit obligations and are not directly subject to escalating medical cost inflation.Competitive EnvironmentChubb Life's competition differs by location but generally includes multinational insurers, and in some locations, local insurers, joint ventures, or state-owned insurers. Chubb's financial strength and reputation as an entrepreneurial organization with a global presence gives Chubb Life a strong base from which to compete. While Chubb Life Re is not currently quoting on new opportunities in the variable annuity reinsurance marketplace, we continue to monitor developments in this market. Combined Insurance competes for A&H business in the U.S. against numerous A&H and life insurance companies across various industry segments.9Table of ContentsCorporateCorporate results primarily include results of all run-off asbestos and environmental (A&E) exposures, the results of our run-off Brandywine business, the results of Westchester specialty operations for 1996 and prior years, certain other run-off exposures, and income and expenses not attributable to reportable segments and the results of our non-insurance companies. The run-off operations do not actively sell insurance products, but are responsible for the management of existing policies and settlement of related claims.Our exposure to A&E claims principally arises out of liabilities acquired when we purchased Westchester Specialty in 1998, CIGNA’s P&C business in 1999, and Chubb Corp A&E claims in 2016. The A&E liabilities principally relate to claims arising from bodily-injury claims related to asbestos products and remediation costs associated with hazardous waste sites. UnderwritingChubb is an underwriting company and we strive to emphasize quality of underwriting rather than volume of business or market share. Our underwriting strategy is to manage risk by employing consistent, disciplined pricing and risk selection. This, coupled with writing a number of less cyclical product lines, has helped us develop flexibility and stability of our business, and has allowed us to maintain a profitable book of business throughout market cycles. Clearly defined underwriting authorities, standards, and guidelines coupled with a strong underwriting audit function are in place in each of our local operations and global profit centers. Global product boards ensure consistency of approach and the establishment of best practices throughout the world. Our priority is to help ensure adherence to criteria for risk selection by maintaining high levels of experience and expertise in our underwriting staff. In addition, we employ a business review structure that helps ensure control of risk quality and appropriate use of policy limits and terms and conditions. Underwriting discipline is at the heart of our operating philosophy.Actuaries in each region work closely with the underwriting teams to provide additional expertise in the underwriting process. We use internal and external data together with sophisticated analytical, catastrophe loss and risk modeling techniques to ensure an appropriate understanding of risk, including diversification and correlation effects, across different product lines and territories. We recognize that climate changes and weather patterns are integral to our underwriting process and we continually adjust our process to address these changes. This is intended to help to ensure that losses are contained within our risk tolerance and appetite for individual product lines, businesses, and Chubb as a whole. Our use of such tools and data also reflects an understanding of their inherent limitations and uncertainties.We also purchase protection from third parties, including, but not limited to, reinsurance as a tool to diversify risk and limit the net loss potential of catastrophes and large or unusually hazardous risks.

CGM, our London-based international specialty and excess and surplus lines business, includes Lloyd's of London (Lloyd's) Syndicate 2488, a wholly-owned Chubb syndicate supported by funds at Lloyd’s provided by Chubb Corporate Members.

Principal casualty products are commercial primary and excess casualty, environmental, and general liability.

The A&H operations primarily offer personal accident and supplemental medical coverages including accidental death, business/holiday travel, specified disease, disability, medical and hospital indemnity, and income protection. We are not in the primary healthcare business. With respect to our supplemental medical and hospital indemnity products, we typically pay fixed amounts for claims and are therefore largely insulated from the direct impact of rising healthcare costs. Chubb International specialty coverages include D&O, professional indemnity, energy, aviation, political risk, and specialty personal lines products. Chubb International's personal lines operations provide specialty products and services designed to meet the needs of specific target markets and include property damage, automobile, homeowners, and personal liability. Chubb International’s presence in China also includes its 30.9 percent ownership interest in Huatai Insurance Group Company Limited (Huatai Group).

Therefore, Chubb owns an approximately 30.9 percent indirect ownership interest in Huatai P&C, which provides a range of commercial and personal P&C products in China, including property, professional liability, product liability, employer liability, business interruption, marine cargo, personal accident and specialty risk.

For the A&H lines of business, locally based competitors also include financial institutions and bank owned insurance subsidiaries. Our international operations have the distinct advantage of being part of one of the few international insurance groups with a global network of licensed companies able to write policies on a locally admitted basis. The principal competitive factors that affect the international operations are underwriting expertise and pricing, relative operating efficiency, product differentiation, producer relations, and the quality of policyholder services. A competitive strength of our international operations is our global network and breadth of insurance programs, which assist individuals and business organizations to meet their risk management objectives, while also having a significant presence in all of the countries in which we operate, giving us the advantage of accessing local technical expertise and regulatory environments, understanding local markets and culture, accomplishing a spread of risk, and offering a global network to service multinational accounts.CGM is one of the preeminent international specialty insurers in London and is an established lead underwriter on a significant portion of the risks it underwrites for all lines of business.

Our geographic reach is also sought by multinational ceding companies since our offices, except for Bermuda, provide local reinsurance license capabilities which benefit our clients in dealing with country regulators.Life Insurance (7 percent of 2020 Consolidated NPE)OverviewThe Life Insurance segment comprises Chubb's international life operations (Chubb Life), Chubb Tempest Life Re (Chubb Life Re), and the North American supplemental A&H and life business of Combined Insurance.Products and DistributionChubb Life provides individual life and group benefit insurance primarily in Asia, including Hong Kong, Indonesia, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, Vietnam, and Myanmar; throughout Latin America; selectively in Europe; Egypt; and in China through our direct and indirect investments in Huatai Group and Huatai Life Insurance Co., Ltd.

Chubb Life offers a broad portfolio of protection and savings products including whole life, endowment plans, individual term life, group term life, medical and health, personal accident, credit life, universal life, Group Employee benefits, unit linked contracts, and credit protection insurance for automobile, motorcycle and home loans. The policies written by Chubb Life generally provide funds to beneficiaries of insureds after death and/or protection and/or savings benefits while the contract owner is living. Chubb Life sells to consumers through a variety of distribution channels including captive and independent agencies, bancassurance, worksite marketing, retailers, brokers, telemarketing, mobilassurance, and direct to consumer marketing. We continue to expand Chubb Life with a focus on opportunities in developing markets that we believe will result in strong and sustainable operating profits as well as a favorable return on capital commitments over time. Our dedicated captive agency distribution channel, whereby agents sell Chubb Life products exclusively, enables us to maintain direct contact with the individual consumer, promote quality sales practices, and exercise greater control over the future of the business. We have developed a substantial sales force of agents principally located in our Asia-Pacific countries. As of December 31, 2020, Chubb had a 57.5 percent direct and indirect ownership interest in Huatai Life, comprising a 20 percent direct ownership interest as well as a 37.5 percent indirect ownership interest through Huatai Group, the parent company of Huatai Life. Huatai Life commenced operations in 2005 and has since grown to become one of the larger life insurance foreign joint ventures in China. Huatai Life offers a broad portfolio of insurance products including whole life, universal life, medical and health, personal accident and disability.

Chubb Life Re's U.S.-based traditional life reinsurance operation was discontinued for new business in January 2010. Since 2007, Chubb Life Re has not quoted on new opportunities in the variable annuity reinsurance marketplace and our focus has been on managing the current portfolio of risk, both in the aggregate and on a contract basis. This business is managed with a long-term perspective and short-term net income volatility is expected.Combined Insurance distributes specialty supplemental A&H and life insurance products targeted to middle income consumers and businesses in the U.S. and Canada. Combined Insurance's substantial North American sales force distributes a wide range of supplemental accident and sickness insurance products, including personal accident, short-term disability, critical illness, Medicare supplement products, and hospital confinement/recovery. Most of these products are primarily fixed-indemnity benefit obligations and are not directly subject to escalating medical cost inflation.Competitive EnvironmentChubb Life's competition differs by location but generally includes multinational insurers, and in some locations, local insurers, joint ventures, or state-owned insurers. Chubb's financial strength and reputation as an entrepreneurial organization with a global presence gives Chubb Life a strong base from which to compete. While Chubb Life Re is not currently quoting on new opportunities in the variable annuity reinsurance marketplace, we continue to monitor developments in this market. Combined Insurance competes for A&H business in the U.S. against numerous A&H and life insurance companies across various industry segments.CorporateCorporate results primarily include results of all run-off asbestos and environmental (A&E) exposures, the results of our run-off Brandywine business, the results of Westchester specialty operations for 1996 and prior years, certain other run-off exposures, and income and expenses not attributable to reportable segments and the results of our non-insurance companies. The run-off operations do not actively sell insurance products, but are responsible for the management of existing policies and settlement of related claims.Our exposure to A&E claims principally arises out of liabilities acquired when we purchased Westchester Specialty in 1998, CIGNA’s P&C business in 1999, and The Chubb Corporation in 2016. The A&E liabilities principally relate to claims arising from bodily-injury claims related to asbestos products and remediation costs associated with hazardous waste sites. UnderwritingChubb is an underwriting company and we strive to emphasize quality of underwriting rather than volume of business or market share. Our underwriting strategy is to manage risk by employing consistent, disciplined pricing and risk selection. This, coupled with writing a number of less cyclical product lines, has helped us develop flexibility and stability of our business, and has allowed us to maintain a profitable book of business throughout market cycles. Clearly defined underwriting authorities, standards, and guidelines coupled with a strong underwriting audit function are in place in each of our local operations and global profit centers. Global product boards ensure consistency of approach and the establishment of best practices throughout the world. Our priority is to help ensure adherence to criteria for risk selection by maintaining high levels of experience and expertise in our underwriting staff. In addition, we employ a business review structure that helps ensure control of risk quality and appropriate use of policy limits and terms and conditions. Underwriting discipline is at the heart of our operating philosophy.Actuaries in each region work closely with the underwriting teams to provide additional expertise in the underwriting process. We use internal and external data together with sophisticated analytical, catastrophe loss and risk modeling techniques to ensure an appropriate understanding of risk, including diversification and correlation effects, across different product lines and territories. We recognize that climate changes and weather patterns are integral to our underwriting process and we continually adjust our process to address these changes. This is intended to help ensure that exposures are priced appropriately and resulting losses are contained within our risk tolerance and appetite for individual product lines, businesses, and Chubb as a whole. Our use of such tools and data also reflects an understanding of their inherent limitations and uncertainties.10Table of ContentsWe also purchase protection from third parties, including, but not limited to, reinsurance as a tool to diversify risk and limit the net loss potential of catastrophes and large or unusually hazardous risks.

Chubb International's P&C business is generally written, on both a direct and assumed basis, 7Table of Contentsthrough major international, regional, and local brokers and agents. Certain branded products are also offered via digital-commerce platforms, allowing agents and brokers to quote, bind, and issue policies at their convenience. Property insurance products include traditional commercial fire coverage, as well as energy industry-related, marine, construction, and other technical coverages. Principal casualty products are commercial primary and excess casualty, environmental, and general liability. A&H and other consumer lines products are distributed through brokers, agents, direct marketing programs, including thousands of telemarketers, and sponsor relationships. The A&H operations primarily offer personal accident and supplemental medical coverages including accidental death, business/holiday travel, specified disease, disability, medical and hospital indemnity, and income protection. We are not in the primary healthcare business. With respect to our supplemental medical and hospital indemnity products, we typically pay fixed amounts for claims and are therefore largely insulated from the direct impact of rising healthcare costs. Chubb International specialty coverages include D&O, professional indemnity, cyber, surety, aviation, political risk, and specialty personal lines products. Chubb International personal lines operations provide a wide range of consumer lines products to meet the needs of specific target markets around the world. Products include high net worth homes, traditional homeowners, automobile, and specialty products that cover smart phones, spectacles, and personal cyber risk. Chubb International’s presence in China also includes its 47.3 percent ownership interest in Huatai Group. Huatai Group wholly owns Huatai Property & Casualty Insurance Co., Ltd. (Huatai P&C). Therefore, Chubb owns an approximately 47.3 percent indirect ownership interest in Huatai P&C, which provides a range of commercial and personal P&C products in China, including property, professional liability, product liability, employer liability, business interruption, marine cargo, personal accident, and specialty risk. These products are marketed through a variety of distribution channels including over 200 licensed sales locations in 28 Chinese provinces.

CGM uses CEG to underwrite similar classes of business through its network of U.K. and European licenses, and in the U.S. where it is eligible to write excess and surplus lines business. Factors influencing the decision to place business with the Syndicate or CEG include licensing eligibilities and client/broker preference. All business underwritten by CGM is accessed through registered brokers. The main lines of business include aviation, property, energy, professional lines, marine, financial lines, political risk, and credit.Competitive EnvironmentChubb International's primary competitors include U.S.-based companies with global operations, as well as non-U.S. global carriers and indigenous companies in regional and local markets. For the A&H lines of business, locally based competitors also include financial institutions and bank owned insurance subsidiaries. Our international operations have the distinct advantage of being part of one of the few international insurance groups with a global network of licensed companies able to write policies on a locally admitted basis. Our international operations also have the advantage of selling products through a variety of distribution channels including partnerships with major international, regional, and local brokers and agents. Additionally, as noted above, certain branded products are also offered via digital-commerce platforms. The principal competitive factors that affect the international operations are underwriting expertise and pricing, relative operating efficiency, product differentiation, producer relations, and the quality of policyholder services. A competitive strength of our international operations is our global network and breadth of insurance programs, which assist individuals and business organizations to meet their risk management objectives, while also having a significant presence in all of the countries in which we operate, giving us the advantage of accessing local technical expertise and regulatory environments, understanding local markets and culture, accomplishing a spread of risk, and offering a global network to service multinational accounts.CGM is one of the preeminent international specialty insurers in London and is an established lead underwriter on a significant portion of the risks it underwrites for all lines of business.

Competition for international risks is also seen from domestic insurers in the country of origin of the insured. CGM differentiates itself from competitors through long standing experience in its product lines, its multiple insurance entities (Syndicate 2488 and CEG), and the quality of its underwriting and claims service.8Table of ContentsGlobal Reinsurance (2 percent of 2021 Consolidated NPE)OverviewThe Global Reinsurance segment represents Chubb's reinsurance operations comprising Chubb Tempest Re Bermuda, Chubb Tempest Re USA, Chubb Tempest Re International, and Chubb Tempest Re Canada.

In addition, capital markets participants have developed alternative capital sources intended to compete with traditional reinsurance. Additionally, government sponsored or backed catastrophe funds can affect demand for reinsurance. Global Reinsurance is typically involved in the negotiation and quotation of the terms and conditions of the majority of the contracts in which it participates. Global Reinsurance competes effectively in P&C markets worldwide because of Chubb's strong capital position, analytical capabilities, experienced underwriting team and quality customer service. The key competitors in our markets vary by geographic region and product line.

We earn income on investment contracts from both net investment spreads on policy holder account balances and fees for management and administrative services. The size of policyholder account balances will primarily determine the amount of income generated from investment contracts. These investment contracts are an important component of production and are key to our efforts to grow our business. Chubb Life sells to consumers through a variety of distribution channels including captive and independent agencies, bancassurance, worksite marketing, retailers, brokers, telemarketing, mobilassurance, and direct to consumer marketing.

Chubb Tempest Re Bermuda also writes other types of reinsurance on a limited basis for some select clients.Chubb Tempest Re USA offers an array of traditional and specialty P&C reinsurance for the North American market, principally on a treaty basis, with a focus on writing property and casualty reinsurance. Chubb Tempest Re USA underwrites reinsurance on both a proportional and excess of loss basis.Chubb Tempest Re International offers an array of traditional and specialty P&C reinsurance to insurance companies worldwide, with emphasis on non-U.S. and non-Canadian risks, including but not limited to property, property catastrophe, casualty, marine, and specialty through its London- and Zurich-based offices. Chubb Tempest Re International underwrites reinsurance on both a proportional and excess of loss basis.Chubb Tempest Re Canada offers an array of traditional and specialty P&C reinsurance for the Canadian market, including but not limited to property, property catastrophe, casualty, surety, and crop-hail. Chubb Tempest Re Canada underwrites reinsurance on both a proportional and excess of loss basis.Competitive EnvironmentThe Global Reinsurance segment competes worldwide with major U.S. and non-U.S. reinsurers as well as reinsurance departments of numerous multi-line insurance organizations. In addition, capital markets participants have developed alternative capital sources intended to compete with traditional reinsurance. Government sponsored or backed catastrophe funds can also affect demand for reinsurance. Global Reinsurance is typically involved in the negotiation and quotation of the terms and conditions of the majority of the contracts in which it participates. Global Reinsurance competes effectively in P&C markets worldwide because of Chubb's strong capital position, analytical capabilities, experienced underwriting team and quality customer service. The key competitors in our markets vary by geographic region and product line. An advantage of our international platform is that we can change our mix of business in response to changes in competitive conditions in the territories in which we operate. Our geographic reach is also sought by multinational ceding companies since our offices, except for Bermuda, provide local reinsurance license capabilities which benefit our clients in dealing with country regulators.Life Insurance (9 percent of 2022 Consolidated NPE)OverviewThe Life Insurance segment comprises our international life operations (Chubb Life), Chubb Tempest Life Re (Chubb Life Re), and the North American supplemental A&H and life business of Combined Insurance.Products and DistributionChubb Life provides individual life and group benefit insurance primarily in Asia, including Hong Kong, Indonesia, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, Vietnam, and Myanmar. On July 1, 2022, we expanded our presence in Asia with the acquisition of Cigna’s A&H and life insurance operations. Predominantly writing a portfolio of personal accident and supplemental health insurance and term life, the operations are located in Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, New Zealand, and Indonesia. Chubb Life also provides 9Table of Contentscoverage throughout Latin America; selectively in Europe; Egypt; and in China through our direct and indirect investments in Huatai Group, Huatai Life Insurance Co., Ltd. (Huatai Life) and Huatai Asset Management Co., Ltd. Chubb Life offers a broad portfolio of protection and savings products including whole life, endowment plans, individual term life, group term life, medical and health, personal accident, credit life, universal life, Group Employee benefits, unit linked contracts, and credit protection insurance for automobile, motorcycle, and home loans. The policies written by Chubb Life generally provide funds to beneficiaries of insureds after death and/or protection and/or savings benefits while the contract owner is living. We earn income from both insurance contracts subject to mortality and morbidity risks and investment contracts not subject to insurance risks. Funds received from policyholders for investment contracts are not recorded as premium revenue, but rather as a policyholder deposits with an offsetting policy holder account balance liability on the balance sheet. We earn income on investment contracts from both net investment spreads on policy holder account balances and fees for management and administrative services. The size of policyholder account balances will primarily determine the amount of income generated from investment contracts. These investment contracts are an important component of production and are key to our efforts to grow our business. Chubb Life sells to consumers through a variety of distribution channels including captive and independent agencies, bancassurance, worksite marketing, retailers, brokers, telemarketing, mobilassurance, and direct to consumer marketing. We continue to expand Chubb Life with a focus on opportunities in international markets that we believe will result in sustainable operating profits and achieve target returns on invested capital. Our dedicated captive agency distribution channel, whereby agents sell Chubb Life products exclusively, enables us to maintain direct contact with the individual consumer, promote quality sales practices, and exercise greater control over the future of the business. We have developed a substantial sales force of agents principally located in our Asia-Pacific countries. As of December 31, 2022, Chubb had a 57.7 percent direct and indirect ownership interest in Huatai Life, comprising a 20 percent direct ownership interest as well as a 37.7 percent indirect ownership interest through Huatai Group, the parent company of Huatai Life. Huatai Life commenced operations in 2005 and has since grown to become one of the larger life insurance foreign joint ventures in China. Huatai Life offers a broad portfolio of insurance products including whole life, universal life, medical and health, personal accident, and disability. These products are marketed through a variety of distribution channels including over 400 licensed sales locations in 20 Chinese provinces. We also have an indirect investment in Huatai Asset Management, a third-party investment management firm, through our direct ownership in Huatai Group. On January 4, 2023, we increased our direct and indirect ownership interest in Huatai Life to 71.1 percent, through our increased ownership in Huatai Group. Refer to Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.Chubb Life Re's core business is a Bermuda-based operation which provides reinsurance to primary life insurers, focusing on guarantees included in certain variable annuity products and also on more traditional mortality reinsurance protection. Chubb Life Re's U.S.-based traditional life reinsurance operation was discontinued for new business in January 2010. Since 2007, Chubb Life Re has not quoted on new opportunities in the variable annuity reinsurance marketplace and our focus has been on managing the current portfolio of risk, both in the aggregate and on a contract basis. This business is managed with a long-term perspective and short-term net income volatility is expected.Combined Insurance distributes specialty supplemental A&H and life insurance products targeted to middle income consumers and businesses in the U.S. and Canada through both direct marketing and worksite sales, through our Chubb Workplace Benefits platform. Combined Insurance's substantial North American sales force distributes a wide range of supplemental accident and sickness insurance products, including personal accident, short-term disability, critical illness, Medicare supplement products, and hospital confinement/recovery. Most of these products are primarily fixed-indemnity benefit obligations and are not directly subject to escalating medical cost inflation.Competitive EnvironmentChubb Life's competition differs by location but generally includes multinational insurers, local insurers, joint ventures, and state-owned insurers. Chubb's financial strength and reputation as an entrepreneurial organization with a global presence gives Chubb Life a strong base from which to compete. While Chubb Life Re is not currently quoting on new opportunities in the variable annuity reinsurance marketplace, we continue to monitor developments in this market. Combined Insurance competes for A&H business in the U.S. against numerous A&H and life insurance companies across various industry segments.10Table of ContentsCorporateCorporate results primarily include results of all run-off asbestos and environmental (A&E) exposures, the results of our run-off Brandywine business, the results of Westchester specialty operations for 1996 and prior years, certain other run-off exposures including molestation exposures, and income and expenses not attributable to reportable segments and the results of our non-insurance companies. The run-off operations do not actively sell insurance products, but are responsible for the management of existing policies and settlement of related claims.Our exposure to A&E, abuse or molestation claims principally arises out of liabilities acquired when we purchased Westchester Specialty in 1998, CIGNA’s P&C business in 1999, and The Chubb Corporation in 2016. The A&E liabilities principally relate to claims arising from bodily-injury claims related to asbestos products and remediation costs associated with hazardous waste sites. UnderwritingChubb is an underwriting company and we strive to emphasize quality of underwriting rather than volume of business or market share. Our underwriting strategy is to manage risk by employing consistent, disciplined pricing and risk selection. This, coupled with writing a number of less cyclical product lines, has helped us develop flexibility and stability of our business, and has allowed us to maintain a profitable book of business throughout market cycles. Clearly defined underwriting authorities, standards, and guidelines coupled with a strong underwriting audit function are in place in each of our local operations and global profit centers. Global product boards ensure consistency of approach and the establishment of best practices throughout the world. Our priority is to help ensure adherence to criteria for risk selection by maintaining high levels of experience and expertise in our underwriting staff. In addition, we employ a business review structure that helps ensure control of risk quality and appropriate use of policy limits and terms and conditions. Underwriting discipline is at the heart of our operating philosophy.Actuaries in each region work closely with the underwriting teams to provide additional expertise in the underwriting process. We use internal and external data together with sophisticated analytical, catastrophe loss and risk modeling techniques to ensure an appropriate understanding of risk, including diversification and correlation effects, across different product lines and territories. We recognize that climate changes and weather patterns, as well as inflationary forces, are integral to our underwriting process and we continually adjust our process to address these changes. This is intended to help ensure that exposures are priced appropriately and resulting losses are contained within our risk tolerance and appetite for individual product lines, businesses, and Chubb as a whole. Our use of such tools and data also reflects an understanding of their inherent limitations and uncertainties. We also purchase protection from third parties, including, but not limited to, reinsurance as a tool to diversify risk and limit the net loss potential of catastrophes and large or unusually hazardous risks.

896159,CB,Chubb Ltd,2004,"ITEM 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following is a discussion of our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity and capital resources as of and for the year ended December 31, 2003. This discussion should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes presented on pages F-1 to F-55 of this Form 10-K. Overview ACE Limited (ACE) is the Bermuda-based holding company of the ACE Group of Companies incorporated with limited liability under the Cayman Islands Companies Law. We created our business office in Bermuda in 1985 when we initially incorporated the Company and we continue to maintain our business office in Bermuda. Through our various operating subsidiaries, we provide a broad range of insurance and reinsurance products to insureds worldwide through operations in the U.S. and almost 50 other countries. Our long-term business strategy focuses on achieving underwriting income and providing value to our clients and shareholders through the utilization of our substantial capital base in the insurance and reinsurance markets. As an insurance and reinsurance company, we generate gross revenues from two principal sources, premiums which are usually paid in advance of loss payments, and dividends and interest income earned on invested assets. Cash flow is generated from premiums collected and investment income received less paid losses and loss expenses. Generally when an insurance company writing long-tail business grows, as ACE has in 2003, its cash flows tend to be positive. ACE generated approximately $4.2 billion in positive operating cash flow in 2003 while cash and invested assets over this period increased by $5.3 billion. Invested assets are generally held in liquid, investment grade fixed income securities of relatively short duration. We also invest a small portion of our assets in less liquid or higher risk assets in an attempt to achieve higher returns. Claims payments in any short-term period are highly unpredictable due to the random nature of loss events and the timing of claims awards or settlements. The value of investments held to pay future claims is subject to market forces such as the level of interest rates, stock market volatility and credit events such as corporate defaults. The actual cost of claims is also volatile based on loss trends, inflation rates, court awards and catastrophic events. We believe that our cash balances, our highly liquid investments, credit facilities and reinsurance protection provide sufficient liquidity to meet any unforeseen claim demands that might occur in the year ahead. The insurance industry is highly competitive with many companies offering similar coverage. Following two years of sharply rising prices, property insurance rates have leveled off or have declined slightly. The global property catastrophe reinsurance market has also softened with adequate capacity available for good risks. In other lines with rising loss costs, such as casualty and liability lines, or directors and officers liability insurance, rates have continued to increase and terms and conditions have remained restrictive. Overall we believe that current rate levels are adequate for most of the risks seeking coverage and that favorable industry conditions should persist through the balance of 2004. Several industry trends are noteworthy, first, favorable capital markets have facilitated the formation of several important new companies anxious to deploy their capital resources. New companies have become a significant factor in providing adequate insurance and reinsurance capacity and a moderating factor with regard to rising premium rates. Second, older companies with legacy issues such as asbestos or excess liability reserves have experienced adverse development from prior years’ unpaid claims. This has kept rates as well as terms and conditions from weakening. Third, interest rates are at historically low levels requiring companies to look to underwriting profitability as their main source of income. Fourth, the rating agencies have generally operated with a negative bias toward the insurance industry, effectively downgrading nearly all reinsurance industry leaders and reducing ratings on numerous primary insurers. This has put pressure on certain major companies to reduce leverage and risk. 27 Table of Contents In this competitive environment, ACE has maintained its strong financial rating and global infrastructure permitting it to write a considerable volume of new and renewable insurance business at favorable rates. On March 8, 2004, Assured Guaranty, formerly AGC Holdings, filed an amendment to the registration statement filed on December 23, 2003 on Form S-1 for an initial public offering (IPO). Assured Guaranty is a wholly owned subsidiary of ACE Limited. Upon completion of the IPO, Assured Guaranty will be the holding company for the operating units now known as ACE Guaranty Corp. and ACE Capital Re International. These two units form part of the Financial Services segment. We expect to retain as much as 25-35 percent of our interest in Assured Guaranty depending on market conditions. We believe this transaction will allow us to allocate more capital to our P&C business and further strengthen our balance sheet. Our website, under the “Investor Information” tab, has a link to the Form S-1 as filed with the SEC. We are closely following developments on possible legislation to move all U.S. asbestos bodily injury claims to a federal trust for compensation in accordance with an established set of medical criteria and claim values. The trust would be funded by asbestos defendants and their insurers. As currently proposed, ACE would be one of the insurer participants. We believe that if the proposed legislation is enacted, our ultimate funding obligation under the trust would be less than we would be required to pay under the current tort system because the trust would likely avoid payments to unimpaired victims and obviate the need for extensive legal costs. However, we cannot predict if any such proposed legislation will be modified or adopted. Critical Accounting Estimates Our Consolidated Financial Statements include amounts that, either by their nature or due to requirements of accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (GAAP), are determined using best estimates and assumptions. While we believe that the amounts included in our Consolidated Financial Statements reflect our best judgment, actual amounts could ultimately materially differ from those currently presented in our Consolidated Financial Statements. We believe the items that require the most subjective and complex estimates are: • unpaid losses and loss expense reserves, including asbestos reserves; • reinsurance recoverable, including our bad debt provision; • impairments to the carrying value of our investment portfolio; • the valuation of our deferred tax assets; • the fair value of certain derivatives; and • the valuation of goodwill. We believe our accounting policies for these items are of critical importance to our Consolidated Financial Statements. The following discussion provides more information regarding the estimates and assumptions required to arrive at these amounts and should be read in conjunction with the sections entitled: Unpaid Losses and Loss Expenses, Asbestos and Environmental Claims, Reinsurance, Investments and Cash, Net Realized Gains (Losses) and Other Income and Expense Items. Unpaid losses and loss expenses As an insurance and reinsurance company, we are required, under GAAP, to establish loss reserves for the estimated unpaid portion of the ultimate liability for losses and loss expenses under the terms of our policies and agreements with our insured and reinsured customers. These reserves include estimates for both claims that have been reported and those that have been incurred but not reported (IBNR), and include estimates of expenses associated with processing and settling these claims. At December 31, 2003, the unpaid losses and loss expense reserve was $27.1 billion. Our P&C loss reserves are not discounted. The process of establishing reserves for property and casualty (P&C) claims can be complex and is subject to considerable variability as it requires the use of informed estimates and judgments. These estimates and judgments are based on numerous factors, and may be revised as additional experience and other data become available and are reviewed, as new or improved methodologies are developed or as current laws change. We have actuarial staff in each of our operating segments who track insurance reserves and regularly evaluate the levels of loss reserves, taking into consideration factors that may impact the ultimate loss reserves. The potential for variation in loss reserves is impacted by numerous factors, which we explain below. We estimate loss reserves for all insurance and reinsurance business we write. In most cases, we do not have all the necessary information to determine the ultimate settlement value for a claim at the time we are required to accrue for the loss. As a result, historical experience and other statistical information are used to estimate the ultimate cost of the loss, depending on the type of business. To 28 Table of Contents determine carried reserves for a particular line of business, we may perform one or more reserving methods to estimate ultimate losses and loss expenses and use the results to select a single point estimate. These methods may include, but are not necessarily limited to, extrapolations of our historical reported and paid loss data, application of industry loss development patterns to our reported or paid losses, expected loss ratios developed by management, or historical industry loss ratios. Underlying judgments and assumptions that may be incorporated into these actuarial methods include, but are not necessarily limited to, adjustments to historical data used in models to exclude aberrations in claims data such as catastrophes that are typically analyzed separately, application of tail factors used to project ultimate claims from historical loss experience when there are several data points to use, adjustments to actuarial models and related data for known business changes, such as changes in claims covered under insurance contracts, and the effect of recent or pending litigation on future claim settlements. For each of our lines of business, management, in conjunction with internal actuaries, develop their “best estimate” of ultimate liabilities, which they believe provide a reasonable estimate of the required reserve. We utilize one set of assumptions in determining a single point estimate. We do not calculate a range of loss reserve estimates. Actuarial ranges are not a true reflection of the potential volatility between loss reserves estimated at the balance sheet date and the ultimate settlement of losses. This is due to the fact that an actuarial range is developed based on known events as of the valuation date whereas actual volatility or prior period development has historically occurred in subsequent Consolidated Financial Statements in part from events and circumstances that were unknown as of the original valuation date. Since the ACE INA acquisition in 1999, our consolidated reserve for losses and loss expenses, net of reinsurance, reported at each year-end has developed by as much as ten percent (four percent excluding asbestos and environmental reserve strengthening), although ultimate loss reserve development could be higher. See the “Analysis of Losses and Loss Expense Development” for a summary of historical volatility between estimated loss reserves and ultimate loss settlements. The Unpaid Losses and Loss Expenses section below includes a discussion of our reserve-setting procedures by segment. The following is a discussion of specific reserving considerations by type of claim: Short-Tail Business, such as Property Coverages Short-tail business describes lines of business for which losses are usually known and paid shortly after the loss actually occurs. This would include, for example, most property, personal accident, aviation hull and automobile physical damage policies that are written. Typically, there is less variability in these lines of business. Long-Tail Business, such as Casualty Coverages Long-tail business describes lines of business for which specific losses may not be known for some period and losses take much longer to emerge. This includes most casualty lines such as general liability, directors and officers liability (D&O) and workers compensation. Within our general insurance business, long-tail casualty business has been increasing and for the year ended December 31, 2003 comprises approximately 43 percent of net premiums earned. There are many factors contributing to the uncertainty and volatility of long-tail business. Among these are: • Given the recent expansion of this business, historical experience is often too immature to place reliance upon for reserving purposes. Instead, particularly for newer lines of business, reserve methods are based on industry loss ratios or development patterns that reflect the nature and coverage of the underwritten business and its future development. For new or growing lines of business, actual loss experience is apt to differ from industry loss statistics that are based on averages as well as loss experience of previous underwriting years; • The inherent uncertainty of the length of paid and reporting development patterns; • The possibility of future litigation, legislative or judicial change that might impact future loss experience relative to prior loss experience relied upon in loss reserve analyses; and • Loss reserve analyses typically require loss or other data be grouped by common characteristics. If data from two combined lines of business exhibit different characteristics, such as loss payment patterns, the credibility of the reserve estimate could be affected. Because casualty lines of business can have various intricacies in their underlying coverage, there is an inherent risk as to the homogeneity of the underlying data used in performing reserve analyses. At December 31, 2003, approximately 83 percent of our reserves (78 percent excluding asbestos and environmental reserves) relate to long-tail business. The estimation of unpaid losses and loss expense reserves can also be affected by the layer at which a particular contract or set of contracts is written. In the case of direct insurance, where the insurer is taking on risk in the lower value end of the particular contract, the experience will tend to be more frequency driven. These lines of business allow for more traditional actuarial 29 Table of Contents methods to be used in determining loss reserve levels, as it is customary to have more historical experience to rely upon. In the case of excess contracts, the experience will tend to be more of a severity nature, as only a significant loss will enter the layer. For structured or unique contracts, most common to the financial solutions business and to a lesser extent our reinsurance business, traditional actuarial methods for setting loss reserves (such as loss development triangles), have to be tempered with an analysis of each contract’s terms, original pricing information, subsequent internal and external analyses of the ongoing contracts, market exposures and history and qualitative input from claims managers. Asbestos and Environmental Reserves (A&E) Included in our liabilities for losses and loss expenses are liabilities for asbestos, environmental and latent injury damage claims and expenses (A&E). These claims are principally related to claims arising from remediation costs associated with hazardous waste sites and bodily-injury claims related to exposure to asbestos products and environmental hazards. The estimation of these liabilities is particularly sensitive to the recent legal environment, including specific settlements that may be used as precedents to settle future claims. In establishing A&E reserves for periods prior to the fourth quarter of 2002, we assumed that significant additional state judicial or legislative reform would substantially eliminate payments to future claimants who are not physically impaired. In January 2003, we announced additions to our fourth quarter 2002 A&E reserves based on the more conservative assumption that there will be no future state or federal asbestos reform. Therefore, our A&E reserves do not reflect any anticipated changes in the legal, social or economic environment, or any benefit from future legislative reforms. The vast majority of our reserve increase in the fourth quarter of 2002 is due to the strengthening of the IBNR provision for peripheral defendants and future increases in severity. We believe the most significant variables relating to our A&E reserves include assumptions with respect to payments to unimpaired claimants and the liability of peripheral defendants. In establishing our A&E reserves, we consider multiple recoveries by claimants against various defendants; the ability of a claimant to bring a claim in a state in which they have no residency or exposure; the ability of a policyholder to claim the right to non-products coverage; and whether high-level excess policies have the potential to be accessed given the policyholders claim trends and liability situation. The results in asbestos cases announced by other carriers may well have little or no relevance to us because other coverage exposures are highly dependent upon the specific facts of individual coverage and resolution status of disputes among carrier, policyholder and claimants. Based on the policies, the facts, the law and a careful analysis of the impact that these risk factors will likely have on any given account, we estimate the potential liability for indemnity, policyholder defense costs and coverage litigation expense. There are many complex variables that we consider when estimating the reserves for our inventory of asbestos accounts. The variables involved may directly impact the predicted outcome. Sometimes, the outcomes change significantly based on a small change in one risk factor related to just one account. Reinsurance recoverable The recognition of reinsurance recoverable requires two key judgments. The first judgment involves our estimation of the amount of gross IBNR to be ceded to reinsurers. Ceded IBNR is generally developed as part of our loss reserving process and consequently, its estimation is subject to similar risks and uncertainties as the estimation of gross IBNR (see Critical Accounting Estimates – Unpaid losses and loss expenses). The second judgment involves our estimate of the amount of the reinsurance recoverable balance that we will ultimately be unable to recover from related reinsurers due to insolvency, contractual dispute, or for other reasons. Amounts estimated to be uncollectible are reflected in a bad debt provision that reduces the reinsurance recoverable balance and shareholders’ equity. Changes in the bad debt provision are reflected in net income. At December 31, 2003, the reinsurance recoverable balance includes $13.7 billion of reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses and loss expenses, less a provision for bad debts of $557 million. The unpaid recoverable consist of ceded IBNR of $7.3 billion and ceded case reserves of $5.9 billion. Also included are $1.3 billion of reinsurance recoverable on paid loss and loss adjustment expenses, less a provision for bad debts of $403 million. Although the contractual obligation of individual reinsurers to pay their reinsurance obligations is based on specific contract provisions, the collectibility of such amounts requires significant estimation by management. The majority of the balance we have accrued as recoverable will not be due for collection until sometime in the future (in some cases several decades from now). Over this period of time, economic conditions and operational performance of a particular reinsurer may impact their ability to meet these obligations and 30 Table of Contents while they may continue to acknowledge their contractual obligation to do so, they may not have the financial resources or willingness to fully meet their obligation to us. To estimate the bad debt provision, the reinsurance recoverable must first be allocated to applicable reinsurers. This determination is based on a process rather than an estimate, although an element of judgment must be applied. As part of this process, ceded IBNR is allocated by reinsurer. The allocations are generally based on historical relationships between gross and ceded losses. If actual experience varies materially from historical experience, the allocation of reinsurance recoverable by reinsurer will change. While such change is unlikely to result in a large percentage change in the bad debt provision, it could, nevertheless, have a material effect on our net income in the period recorded. We use a default analysis and, to a lesser extent, actual collection experience to estimate uncollectible reinsurance. The primary components of the default analysis are reinsurance recoverable balances by reinsurer, net of collateral, and default factors used to determine the portion of a reinsurer’s balance deemed uncollectible. The definition of collateral for this purpose requires some judgment and is generally limited to assets held in trust, letters of credit, and liabilities held by us with the same legal entity for which we believe there is a right of offset. Default factors require considerable judgment and are determined using the current rating, or rating equivalent, of each reinsurer as well as other key considerations and assumptions. The more significant considerations include, but are not necessarily limited to, the following: • historical industry default statistics for the reinsurer’s current ratings class, the actual collection experience of the reinsurer, collateral triggers or other contractual provisions that may mitigate default exposure, and the dates the balances will likely become due (duration). For recoverable balances considered representative of the larger population (i.e., default probabilities are consistent with similarly rated reinsurers and payment durations conform to averages), management generally applies industry default factors consistent with the reinsurer’s particular rating class. Such factors have been developed by a major ratings agency; • for recoverable balances that are both unrated by a major rating agency and for which management is unable to determine a credible rating equivalent based on a parent, affiliate, peer company, or internal analysis, additional judgment is required to determine a reasonable default factor. Based on certain industry benchmarks, management generally uses a default factor approximating 24 percent for such balances; and • for insolvent insurers, management develops default factors based on an evaluation of each of the insolvent entities. At December 31, 2003, the use of different assumptions within the model could have a material effect on the bad debt provision reflected in our Consolidated Financial Statements. To the extent the creditworthiness of our reinsurers was to deteriorate due to an adverse event affecting the reinsurance industry, such as a large number of major catastrophes, actual uncollectible amounts could be significantly greater than our bad debt provision. Such an event could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and our liquidity. Given the various considerations used to develop default factors, we cannot precisely quantify the effect a specific industry event may have on the bad debt provision. However, based on the composition (particularly the average credit quality) of the reinsurance recoverable balance at December 31, 2003, we estimate that a ratings downgrade of one notch (for example from A to A-) for all rated reinsurers could increase our bad debt provision by as much as 15 percent, assuming no other changes relevant to the calculation. While a rating downgrade would result in an increase in our provision for bad debt and a charge to earnings in that period, a downgrade in and of itself does not imply that we will not ultimately collect all of the ceded reinsurance recoverable from the reinsurers in question. Additional information on reinsurance recoverable can be found in the section entitled “Reinsurance”. Investments We record all investments in our portfolio at fair value, being the quoted market price of these securities provided by either independent pricing services, or when such prices are not available, by reference to broker or underwriter bid indications. We regularly review our investments for possible impairment. If there is a decline in a security’s net realizable value, we must determine whether that decline is temporary or “other than temporary”. If we believe a decline in the value of a particular investment is temporary, we record the decline as an unrealized loss in our shareholders’ equity. If we believe the decline is “other than temporary”, we write down the carrying value of the investment and record a realized loss in our consolidated statement of operations. The determination as to whether or not the decline is “other than temporary” principally requires the following critical judgments: i) the circumstances that require management to 31 Table of Contents make a specific assessment as to whether or not the decline is “other than temporary”, such as the time period an investment has been in a loss position and the significance of the decline; and ii) for those securities to be assessed, whether we have the ability and intent to hold the security through an expected recovery period, absent a significant change in facts that is expected to have a material adverse effect on either the financial markets or the financial position of the issuer. With respect to securities where the decline in value is determined to be temporary and the security’s value is not written down, a subsequent decision may be made to sell that security and realize a loss. Subsequent decisions on security sales could be made based on changes in liquidity needs (i.e., arising from a large insured loss such as a catastrophe), internal risk management considerations, the financial condition of the issuer or its industry, market conditions, and new investment opportunities. Day to day management of the majority of the Company’s investment portfolio is outsourced to third party investment managers. While these investment managers may, at a given point in time, believe that the preferred course of action is to hold securities with unrealized losses until such losses are recovered, the dynamic nature of portfolio management may result in a subsequent decision to sell the security and realize the loss based upon new circumstances such as those related to the changes described above. We believe that subsequent decisions to sell such securities are consistent with the classification of our portfolio as available for sale. Because our investment portfolio is the largest component of consolidated assets and a multiple of shareholders’ equity, adverse changes in economic conditions subsequent to the balance sheet date could result in other than temporary impairments that are material to the financial condition and operating results of the Company. Such economic changes could arise from overall changes in the financial markets or specific changes to industries, companies, or foreign governments in which the Company maintains relatively large investment holdings. More information regarding our process for reviewing our portfolio for possible impairments can be found in the section entitled “Net Realized Gains (Losses)”. Our exposure to interest rate risk is concentrated in our fixed income portfolio. An increase in interest rates of 50 basis points applied instantly across the yield curve would have resulted in a decrease in the market value of the fixed income portfolio of approximately $347 million at December 31, 2003. An immediate time horizon was used as this presents the worst case scenario. Deferred Tax Assets We provide for income taxes in accordance with the provisions of FAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes” (FAS 109). Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized consistent with the asset and liability method required by FAS 109. Our deferred tax assets and liabilities primarily result from temporary differences between the amounts recorded in our Consolidated Financial Statements and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities. We determine deferred tax assets and liabilities separately for each tax-paying component (an individual entity or group of entities that is consolidated for tax purposes) in each tax jurisdiction. At December 31, 2003, our net deferred tax asset was $1.1 billion, including $412 million of net operating loss carryforwards, which will expire in the years 2018-2022. (See Note 14 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information). At each balance sheet date, management assesses the need to establish a valuation allowance that reduces deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that all, or some portion, of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The valuation allowance is based on all available information including projections of future taxable income from each tax-paying component in each tax jurisdiction principally derived from business plans, and available tax planning strategies. Projections of future taxable income incorporate several assumptions of future business and operations that are apt to differ from actual experience. If, in the future, our assumptions and estimates that resulted in our forecast of future taxable income for each tax-paying component proves to be incorrect, an additional valuation allowance could become necessary. This could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. At December 31, 2003, the valuation allowance of $135.6 million reflects management’s assessment, that it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized due to the inability of certain foreign subsidiaries to generate sufficient taxable income. Derivatives We adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (FAS) No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” (FAS 133), as of January 1, 2001. FAS 133 establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, and for hedging activities. FAS 133 requires that all derivatives be recognized as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and be measured at fair value. We maintain investments in derivative instruments such as futures, options, interest rate swaps and foreign currency forward contracts primarily to manage duration and foreign currency ex - 32 Table of Contents posure, enhance our portfolio yield or obtain an exposure to a particular financial market. Open derivatives as of the balance sheet date are reported at fair value based on market quotes or valuations provided to us by third party investment managers using market data. The net fair value related to these instruments at December 31, 2003, was $21 million and is included in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities. Certain products (principally credit protection oriented) issued by the Financial Services segment have been determined to meet the definition of a derivative under FAS 133. These products consist primarily of credit default swaps, index-based instruments and certain financial guaranty coverages. We view these products, for which we sell credit protection to others, as an extension of our financial guaranty business but which do not qualify for the financial guaranty insurance scope exception under FAS 133 and therefore are reported at fair value, with changes in fair value included in our earnings. We believe that the most meaningful presentation of these derivatives is to reflect revenue as net premiums earned, and to record estimates of losses and loss expenses on specific credit events as incurred losses. When we determine that a loss on a derivative contract is probable, we establish reserves for the loss. Other changes in fair value are included in realized gains and losses on derivative financial instruments. We generally hold derivative contracts to maturity. Where we hold a derivative to maturity, the cumulative unrealized gains and losses will net to zero if we incur no credit losses on that contract. (See Note 2(o) of the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information). The fair value of these instruments depends on a number of factors including credit spreads, changes in interest rates, recovery rates and the credit ratings of referenced entities. Where available, we use quoted market prices to determine the fair value of these insured credit derivatives. If the quoted prices are not available, particularly for senior layer CDOs and equity layer credit protection, the fair value is estimated using valuation models for each type of credit protection. These models may be developed by third parties, such as rating agencies, or internally based on market conventions for similar transactions, depending on the circumstances. These models and the related assumptions are continuously reevaluated by management and enhanced, as appropriate, based upon improvements in modeling techniques and availability of more timely market information. The majority of our single name credit derivatives are valued using third-party market quotes. However, in the event that we terminate a derivative contract prior to maturity, as a result of a decision to exit a line of business or for risk management purposes, the unrealized gain or loss will be realized through premiums earned and losses incurred. Our exposures to CDOs are typically valued using a combination of rating agency models and internally developed models. Valuation models include the use of management estimates and current market information. Management is also required to make assumptions on how the fair value of derivative instruments is affected by current market conditions. Management considers factors such as current prices charged for similar agreements, performance of underlying assets, and our ability to obtain reinsurance for our insured obligations. Due to the inherent uncertainties of the assumptions used in the valuation models to determine the fair value of these derivative products, actual experience may differ from the estimates reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements, and the differences may be material. Fair value adjustments attributed to derivative transactions, principally credit derivatives, are included in our net realized gains (losses). We recorded a gain of $163 million and losses of $77 million in 2003 and 2002, respectively. The change in fair value is due to many factors but primarily due to a change in credit spreads. For example, the 2003 gain corresponds to an approximately 60-65 percent tightening in investment grade corporate spreads and the 2002 loss corresponds to an approximate 20-25 percent widening. Depending on our ultimate percentage holding of Assured Guaranty after the planned IPO and changes in Assured Guaranty’s credit derivatives business after the IPO, the relationship between changes in corporate credit spreads and changes in the fair value of credit derivatives affecting our net income is apt to differ from historical results. Given these variables, the sensitivity of our future net income to changes in credit spreads is difficult to quantify at this time; however, we anticipate that after the completion of the planned IPO such sensitivity will be reduced relative to 2003. In addition to credit derivatives, through the Financial Services segment, we have entered into a few other, relatively illiquid, index-based derivative instruments that are reported at fair value. These instruments are principally linked to equity and real estate market indices. The determination of fair value for these derivatives requires considerable judgment as there is limited ability to trade the contracts since they are uniquely structured and the exposure period covers up to 30 years. 33 Table of Contents Valuation of Goodwill Goodwill, which represents the excess of the cost of our acquisitions over the tangible net assets we acquired, was $2.7 billion at December 31, 2003. The ACE INA acquisition comprises approximately 79 percent of this balance. In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FAS 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets”, which primarily addresses accounting for goodwill and intangible assets subsequent to their acquisition. Under FAS 142, goodwill is no longer amortized to income but instead, is subject to annual impairment tests. At January 1, 2002, the initial adoption date of FAS 142, and January 1, 2003, goodwill was assigned to the applicable reporting units of the acquired entities giving rise to goodwill. Our reporting units for purposes of impairment testing are primarily based on legal entities within our operating segments. The allocation of goodwill to these reporting units is consistent with goodwill recognized at acquisition. In effect, impairment tests are performed for each acquired entity giving rise to goodwill. The most significant reporting units are the domestic and international divisions of ACE INA which were acquired in 1999, ACE Tempest Re acquired in 1996, Tarquin Limited acquired in 1998 and Capital Re Corporation acquired in 1999. There are other reporting units that resulted from smaller acquisitions that are also assessed annually. The transitional impairment test of goodwill determined that there was no impairment in goodwill in 2002. In our impairment tests, we principally use both an earnings model, that includes relevant financial data of comparable companies to the reporting unit being tested, such as the relationship of price to book value for recent transactions and market valuations of publicly traded companies, and an estimation of fair value based on present value of estimated net cash flows. We must assess whether the current fair value of our operating units is at least equal to the fair value used in the determination of goodwill. In doing this, we make assumptions and estimates about the profitability attributable to our operating segments, as this is important in assessing whether an impairment has occurred. As part of our ongoing management assessments, we regularly analyze our operating companies in an effort to maximize future cash flows and profitability. As a result of that review, updated forecasts supported indications that two relatively small majority-owned companies would not, under current market conditions, achieve sufficient contract sales volumes to generate and sustain future profitable results. As a consequence of these revised expectations, we recognized a goodwill impairment loss of $6 million during the first quarter of 2003. If, in the future, our assumptions and estimates made in assessing the fair value of acquired entities prove to be incorrect, goodwill carried on our balance sheet could be materially overstated. This would cause us to write-down the carrying value of goodwill, resulting in a charge to earnings in the period recorded. Accordingly, this could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Results of Operations – Years Ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 The discussions that follow include tables, which show both our consolidated and segment operating results for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001. In presenting our operating results, we have discussed our performance with reference to underwriting results and with reference to income excluding net realized gains (losses) and the related income tax, which are both non-GAAP measures. Our consolidated and segment operating results below provide a reconciliation of underwriting results and income excluding net realized gains (losses) to net income, which we consider to be the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. We consider these measures, which may be defined differently by other companies, to be important to an understanding of our overall results of operations. Underwriting results are calculated by subtracting losses and loss expenses, life and annuity benefits, policy acquisition costs and administrative expenses from net premiums earned. We use underwriting results and operating ratios to monitor the results of our operations without the impact of certain factors, including investment income, other income and expenses, interest and income tax expense and net realized gains (losses). We exclude net realized gains (losses), including the tax effect, when analyzing our operations because the amount of these gains (losses) is heavily influenced by, and fluctuates in part according to, the availability of market opportunities, and are generally driven by economic factors that are not necessarily consistent with key drivers of underwriting performance. We believe the use of these measures enhances the understanding of our results of operations by highlighting the underlying profitability of our insurance business. Underwriting results and income excluding net realized gains (losses) should not be viewed as a substitute for measures determined in accordance with GAAP. 34 Table of Contents Consolidated Operating Results (in millions of U.S. dollars) 2003 2002 2001 Gross premiums written $ 14,637 $ 12,819 $ 10,165 Net premiums written 10,215 8,068 6,363 Net premiums earned 9,602 6,830 5,916 Losses and loss expenses 6,118 4,906 4,552 Life and annuity benefits 181 158 401 Policy acquisition costs 1,357 960 785 Administrative expenses 1,160 944 829 Underwriting income (loss) 786 (138 ) (651 ) Net investment income 861 802 785 Net realized gains (losses) 252 (489 ) (58 ) Other income (expense) (27 ) (21 ) 1 Interest expense 177 193 199 Income tax expense (benefit) 278 (116 ) (78 ) Amortization of goodwill – – 79 Cumulative effect of adopting a new accounting standard – – (23 ) Net income (loss) $ 1,417 $ 77 $ (146 ) Loss and loss expense ratio 65.0% 73.5% 82.6% Policy acquisition cost ratio 14.2% 14.2% 14.1% Administrative expense ratio 12.3% 14.0% 15.0% Combined ratio 91.5% 101.7% 111.7% Gross premiums written increased 14 percent in 2003 compared with 2002. Gross premiums written reflect the premiums paid by our customers to secure insurance or reinsurance protection from us. In 2003, gross premiums written in our P&C businesses increased 21 percent (approximately four percent of this increase is due to the appreciation of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar) and gross premiums written in our Financial Services business decreased 32 percent, compared with 2002. Throughout 2003, we continued to experience rate increases and improved terms and conditions on P&C business, especially casualty policies. The decline in the Financial Services business was primarily due to the reduction of premiums for credit default swaps that cover the equity (first-loss portion) of a synthetic collateralized debt obligation (CDO). As discussed later in this report, production in the Financial Services segment can fluctuate dramatically from period to period. Gross premiums written increased 26 percent in 2002 compared with 2001 and net premiums written increased 27 percent. Net premiums written, which reflect the premiums we retain after purchasing reinsurance protection, increased 27 percent in 2003 compared with 2002. Net premiums written increased 40 percent in our P&C businesses (four percent of this increase is due to appreciation of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar) and decreased 31 percent in our Financial Services business. Our P&C net premiums written are growing more than our P&C gross premiums written because we are retaining more of the business we write. Our retention ratio (the ratio of net premiums written to gross premiums written) increased to 67 percent in 2003 compared with 58 percent in 2002. This reflects a conscious decision on our part to focus on direct lines of business and to shift away from heavily reinsured business. Net premiums earned, which reflect the portion of net premiums written that were recorded as revenues for the period, increased 41 percent in 2003 compared with 2002. Net premiums earned in our P&C businesses increased 50 percent (five percent of this increase is due to the appreciation of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar) while our Financial Services business decreased two percent. The growth in P&C net premiums earned is a result of the growth in P&C net premiums written. Net premiums earned in 2002 increased 15 percent compared with 2001. These increases reflect the improved insurance market conditions that resulted in a combination of price increases on renewal business and growth in new business opportunities. 35 Table of Contents The following table provides a consolidated breakdown of net premiums earned by line of business for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002. (in millions of U.S. dollars) 2003 2002 Casualty $ 4,118 $ 2,589 Property and all other 3,279 2,255 Personal accident 920 701 Total P&C 8,317 5,545 Global Re – life 184 158 Financial guaranty 328 282 Financial solutions 773 845 Net premiums earned $ 9,602 $ 6,830 Underwriting results for our P&C and Financial Services business are discussed by reference to the combined ratio, the loss and loss expense ratio, the policy acquisition cost ratio and the administrative expense ratio. We calculate these ratios by dividing the respective expense amounts of our P&C and Financial Services business by net premiums earned from our P&C and Financial Services business. We do not calculate these ratios for the life reinsurance business, because they are not appropriate measures of the underwriting results for that business. The combined ratio is determined by adding the loss and loss expense ratio, the policy acquisition cost ratio and the administrative expense ratio. A combined ratio under 100 percent indicates underwriting income, and a combined ratio exceeding 100 percent indicates underwriting losses. The loss and loss expense ratio declined in 2003, as the 2002 year was impacted by the increase to our A&E reserve. This reserve strengthening resulted in a net increase in our losses and loss expenses of $516 million ($354 million after tax) and added 7.7 percentage points to our loss and loss expense ratio. In 2003, our losses and loss expenses were higher by $164 million due to the depreciation of the U.S. dollar. Our loss and loss expense ratio is impacted by changes in the mix of business written and the level of catastrophe losses in a period. In 2003, we incurred $112 million of catastrophe losses, compared with $156 million in 2002. We have taken advantage of increasing rates and market opportunities, and most of these opportunities are in the casualty insurance and reinsurance areas, where rate increases are accelerating. Casualty business is typically written at higher loss ratios than property business because in some cases, the losses for casualty business can emerge long after the coverage period has expired, and claim settlement can be more complex than for property claims, which tends to lengthen the settlement period. However, because of the longer claim-payout duration, we benefit from investing the premiums for a longer period of time, therefore potentially increasing our net investment income. We have also increased our loss ratio assumptions over the past year in some of our casualty lines in connection with increases we have made in our retained risk levels. Our loss and loss expense ratio is also influenced by the size of LPTs written in a particular quarter. LPTs are typically recorded at higher loss ratios than our other lines of business. In 2002, we recorded gross premiums written attributed to LPT business of $311 million compared with $274 million in 2003. Also impacting our loss and loss expense ratio is adverse prior period development. We incurred $164 million of adverse prior period development in 2003, compared with $709 million ($193 million excluding A&E) in 2002. Our segment discussions below contain more information about prior period development. The 2001 loss and loss expense ratio was impacted by the September 11 tragedy and reserve strengthening for casualty lines, which added $650 million and $170 million, respectively to losses and loss expenses. Together, these two events added 14.7 percentage points to our 2001 loss and loss expense ratio. Our policy acquisition costs include commissions, premium taxes, underwriting and other costs that vary with, and are primarily related to, the production of premium. The policy acquisition cost ratio was stable in 2003 compared with 2002 and 2001. The positive impact of the increase in net premiums earned was offset by changes in business mix. We have increased the volume of business generated from Global Reinsurance in ACE Tempest Re USA. ACE Tempest Re USA writes a higher proportion of business on a treaty-basis which incurs higher acquisition costs due to higher ceding commission expense. We have also purchased less reinsurance in the Insurance – North American segment, which has resulted in reduced ceding commission income. Administrative expenses include all other 36 Table of Contents operating costs. Administrative expenses increased in 2003 and 2002 to support the growth in our business and partially due to the depreciation of the U.S. dollar, which had the effect of increasing administrative expenses for Insurance – Overseas General. The administrative expense ratio improved in 2003 and 2002 due to the significant increase in net premiums earned. Net investment income increased $59 million in 2003 and $17 million in 2002, due to higher average invested assets, partially offset by a decline in the investment portfolio’s yield due to the impact of lower interest rates. See the section entitled “Net Investment Income” for more information. Increases in net premiums earned and lower catastrophe losses in 2003 contributed to the higher underwriting income compared with 2002, which was impacted by the A&E reserve strengthening. Our net income increased $1.3 billion in 2003 due to higher underwriting income and the impact of net realized gains of $252 million in 2003 compared with net realized losses of $489 million in 2002. The appreciation of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar added $24 million to our net income in 2003. In 2001, we reported underwriting losses due to the September 11 tragedy and the casualty reserve strengthening. Segment Operating Results – Years Ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 The performance of our management for the P&C and Financial Services segments are measured based on the results achieved in underwriting income and income excluding net realized gains (losses). Insurance – North American The Insurance – North American segment comprises our P&C insurance operations in the U.S., Bermuda and Canada. This segment writes a variety of insurance products including property, liability (general liability and workers’ compensation), professional lines (directors and officers (D&O) and errors and omissions coverages (E&O)), marine, program business, accident and health (A&H) – principally being personal accident, aerospace, consumer-oriented products and other specialty lines. (in millions of U.S. dollars) 2003 2002 2001 Gross premiums written $ 6,895 $ 6,116 $ 4,521 Net premiums written 4,015 2,919 1,986 Net premiums earned 3,654 2,475 1,816 Losses and loss expenses 2,521 2,200 1,373 Policy acquisition costs 387 216 206 Administrative expenses 402 341 315 Underwriting income (loss) 344 (282 ) (78 ) Net investment income 410 406 426 Other income (expense) (14 ) 1 1 Interest expense 29 32 37 Income tax expense (benefit) 179 (4 ) 94 Income excluding net realized gains (losses) 532 97 218 Net realized gains (losses) 39 (199 ) (19 ) Tax effect of net realized gains (losses) – 43 8 Net income (loss) $ 571 $ (59 ) $ 207 Loss and loss expense ratio 69.0% 88.9% 75.6% Policy acquisition cost ratio 10.6% 8.7% 11.3% Administrative expense ratio 11.0% 13.8% 17.4% Combined ratio 90.6% 111.4% 104.3% Insurance – North American increased gross premiums written 13 percent in 2003 compared with 2002. This segment continues to benefit from a robust market for casualty lines of business, which represent a growing portion of its gross premiums written. Despite strong casualty premium production in 2003, the growth in gross premiums written has been moderate compared with the 35 percent growth reported in 2002 over 2001. This reflects the stabilization of property rates and our decision to exit certain heavily reinsured program business in late 2002 so that we could deploy our capital in areas with the greatest opportunity for underwriting income. 37 Table of Contents Renewal rates for property business in the U.S. were down slightly in 2003 compared with the significant renewal rate increases experienced in 2002. Overall, property rates are generally at pricing levels that adequately compensate for the exposure being underwritten. For casualty lines, renewal rates on certain of the longer tail lines, such as workers’ compensation, continued to rise, but at a lower pace than in 2002. However, other casualty lines, such as D&O and umbrella excess business, continue to experience solid rate increases in 2003. Insurance – North American significantly increased gross premiums written in 2002 compared with 2001. This increase was due to higher renewal rates as a result of reduced industry capacity, and also due to new products introduced in this segment beginning in 2002, including A&H, excess casualty and medical risk. Net premiums written increased 38 percent in 2003, compared with 2002. The primary factor contributing to the greater growth rate for net premiums written compared with gross premiums written is Insurance – North American’s decision to retain more of its gross premiums written. Insurance – North American increased its retention in order to take advantage of improved market conditions for rates and terms. A shift in business mix has also contributed to the growth in net premiums written in 2003. ACE Risk Management (ARM) has shifted its business mix away from the heavily reinsured program business and has increased retention of national account business. As a result, the retention ratio for Insurance – North American increased to 58 percent for 2003, compared with 48 percent for 2002. Insurance – North American’s insurance operations are organized into distinct divisions, each offering specialized products and services targeted at specific markets. The following table provides an entity/divisional breakdown of Insurance – North American’s net premiums earned for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001. (in millions of U.S. dollars) 2003 2002 2001 ACE Westchester Specialty $ 991 $ 787 $ 506 ACE Risk Management 822 488 388 ACE Diversified Risk 538 259 186 ACE U.S. International 387 313 234 ACE Bermuda 420 259 168 Other 496 369 334 Net premiums earned $ 3,654 $ 2,475 $ 1,816 ACE Westchester Specialty specializes in the wholesale distribution of excess and surplus lines property, inland marine and casualty coverages and products. ACE Westchester Specialty also provides coverage for agriculture business and specialty programs through its Program division. ACE Westchester Specialty’s net premiums earned for 2003 increased 26 percent, compared with 2002. This increase primarily reflects higher casualty writings due to the robust casualty market and growth in agriculture business. ARM, which offers custom coverage solutions for large companies and national accounts, reported an increase of 68 percent in net premiums earned for 2003, compared with 2002. ARM’s increase in net premiums earned is being driven by growth in excess workers’ compensation (primarily high deductible policies in national accounts business) and, to a lesser extent custom casualty due to new business and increased retention ratios. ACE Diversified Risk, which writes D&O, E&O and aerospace business, doubled its net premiums earned in 2003, compared to 2002. The increase primarily reflects higher D&O and E&O production, which have been experiencing a favorable rate environment and more restrictive policy terms and conditions. In addition, aerospace net premiums earned increased due to new business from an aviation syndicate that ACE USA participates in. Net premiums earned also benefited from increased retention. ACE U.S. International (formerly referred to as Specialty P&C) provides worldwide risk protection by offering P&C coverages for U.S.-based multi-national companies. As a result of new business and higher renewal rates, ACE U.S. International’s net premiums earned for 2003 increased 24 percent compared with 2002, due to growth in the casualty and commercial marine lines. ACE Bermuda, which specializes in providing professional lines and excess liability coverage, reported an increase in net premiums earned of 62 percent for 2003, compared with 2002. ACE Bermuda benefited from both higher renewal rates and increased volume of new business. 38 Table of Contents Insurance – North American’s other divisions include ACE Select Markets (formerly referred to as Consumer Solutions group), ACE Casualty Risk, the A&H group, Global Energy, ACE USA Warranty, the run-off operations and our insurance-related service operations. Net premiums earned for these divisions increased $127 million for 2003, compared with 2002. Contributing to this increase was higher premium volume for ACE Casualty Risk and the A&H group. These units commenced operations in 2002 and 2001, respectively, and are experiencing strong demand for their primary product offerings, mainly umbrella excess for ACE Casualty Risk and personal accident coverage for the A&H group. In addition, ACE Select Markets also reported strong increases in net premiums earned primarily in 2003 for recreational marine business. The loss and loss expense ratio decreased to 69.0 percent in 2003, compared with 88.9 percent in 2002. Losses and loss expenses for 2002 included $516 million related to the A&E reserve strengthening, which added 20.9 percentage points to the 2002 loss and loss expense ratio. The 2003 loss and loss expense ratio for Insurance – North American reflects the effect of a greater proportion of net premiums earned relating to casualty business, which has a longer claim-payout duration and typically produces higher loss and loss expense ratios than property business. The shift to more casualty business in 2003 more than offset the benefit of rate increases on both property and casualty lines of business in 2002. Additionally, Insurance – North American incurred adverse prior period development of $91 million in 2003, compared with adverse development of $79 million in 2002. The 2003 adverse development related primarily to casualty lines and principally emerged from medical inflation in workers’ compensation and large loss activity in commercial multi-peril. Additional minor development was experienced in professional liability, reinsurance of long-term disability and run-off business offset by positive development on property, excess liability and marine lines of business because case reserves developed better than expected. The 2002 development was primarily from run-off business with the remainder being attributed to several lines of business including workers’ compensation, commercial automobile, health care asset management run-off, warranty and financial institutions business. Losses and loss expenses for 2001 included $119 million related to the September 11 tragedy. The policy acquisition cost ratio increased despite the growth in net premiums earned, compared with 2002. This reflects the decision to retain a greater percentage of the gross premiums written and to purchase less reinsurance, which has resulted in reduced ceding commissions for Insurance – North American. The administrative expense ratio declined due to the increase in net premiums earned. Administrative expenses increased mainly due to the increased costs associated with servicing the growth in Insurance – North American’s product lines. The policy acquisition cost and administrative expense ratios both declined in 2002 compared with 2001 due to increased net premiums earned with a higher proportion of lower commission professional lines business. Income excluding net realized gains (losses) increased $435 million in 2003, compared with 2002, as a result of higher underwriting income. The decrease in 2002 compared with 2001, is primarily due to the asbestos reserve strengthening. Insurance – Overseas General The Insurance – Overseas General segment comprises ACE International, our network of indigenous insurance operations, and the insurance operations of ACE Global Markets. The Insurance – Overseas General segment writes a variety of insurance products including property, casualty, professional lines (D&O and E&O), marine, energy, aviation, political risk, consumer-oriented products and A&H – principally being supplemental accident. 39 Table of Contents (in millions of U.S. dollars) 2003 2002 2001 Gross premiums written $ 5,191 $ 4,114 $ 3,289 Net premiums written 3,751 2,716 2,154 Net premiums earned 3,563 2,393 1,941 Losses and loss expenses 2,144 1,455 1,465 Policy acquisition costs 682 533 445 Administrative expenses 486 390 333 Underwriting income (loss) 251 15 (302 ) Net investment income 159 108 102 Other income (expense) (7 ) 2 (1 ) Interest expense 4 3 2 Income tax expense (benefit) 84 6 (87 ) Amortization of goodwill – – 3 Income excluding net realized gains (losses) 315 116 (119 ) Net realized gains (losses) (6 ) (37 ) (5 ) Tax effect of net realized gains (losses) 5 12 2 Net income (loss) $ 314 $ 91 $ (122 ) Loss and loss expense ratio 60.2% 60.8% 75.5% Policy acquisition cost ratio 19.2% 22.3% 22.9% Administrative expense ratio 13.6% 16.3% 17.2% Combined ratio 93.0% 99.4% 115.6% Gross premiums written for the Insurance – Overseas General segment increased 26 percent in 2003 compared with 2002. The depreciation of the U.S. dollar against the major currencies accounted for approximately ten percent of the increase in gross premiums written in 2003. ACE International experienced growth across most of its regions, and ACE Global Markets experienced improved market conditions across most of its lines of business. This segment’s gross premiums written increased in 2002 compared with 2001, due to rate increases, new business writings and the weakening of the U.S. dollar. ACE International’s P&C operations are organized geographically along product lines. Property insurance products include traditional commercial fire coverage as well as energy industry-related coverages. Principal casualty products are commercial general liability and liability coverage for multinational organizations. Through our professional lines, we provide D&O and professional indemnity coverages for medium to large clients. The A&H insurance operations provide coverage to individuals and groups outside of U.S. insurance markets. ACE International’s gross premiums written increased 36 percent to $3.6 billion in 2003 compared with $2.7 billion in 2002. The increases are due to higher rates and new business across most regions and also due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar against the pound sterling, euro and yen during the period. The depreciation of the U.S. dollar against the major currencies accounted for approximately 12 percent of the increase in gross premiums written in 2003. ACE Europe, which accounts for more than half of ACE International’s gross premiums written, continues to experience rising rates and growth in new policies for casualty business. Additionally, ACE Europe’s A&H lines have contributed positive growth due to strong volume increases. ACE Europe’s P&C growth was driven by rate increases and new business, specifically professional lines, while its A&H growth was driven by continued success in direct marketing campaigns. Asia Pacific reported production growth for P&C lines due to increases in new business and strong Australian growth while A&H lines increased due to favorable results from direct marketing channels. ACE Latin America reported strong demand for A&H products in Mexico and Brazil, and growth in new P&C policies. ACE Far East production declined due primarily to the adverse effect of the SARS epidemic on travel accident insurance and our decision to selectively renew the auto portfolio. ACE International’s gross premiums written increased 26 percent in 2002 compared with 2001, due to higher renewal rates and increased new business across most regions. ACE Global Markets primarily underwrites P&C insurance through Lloyd’s Syndicate 2488 and ACE INA UK Limited. The main lines of business include aviation, property, energy, professional lines, marine, political risk and A&H. ACE Global Markets’ gross premiums written increased nine percent to $1.6 billion in 2003, compared with 2002. The increase is primarily due to the depreciation of the U.S. 40 Table of Contents dollar against the major currencies which accounted for approximately three-quarters of the increase in gross premiums written. ACE Global Markets has been able to build upon favorable market conditions, reporting overall average rate increases of 10 percent in 2003. This is a significant achievement, given that this is in addition to average renewal rate increases that were in excess of 40 percent in 2002. Production in 2003 was subdued by lower rates on certain classes of aviation business and the impact of falling airline passenger movement due to the Iraq conflict and SARS. While rates for certain lines of business have stabilized, there are a number of business classes, most notably professional lines, where rates continue to rise. ACE Global Market’s gross premiums written increased by 23 percent to $1.5 billion in 2002 compared with $1.2 billion in 2001. This increase was due to rate increases across most lines and growth in new business. The retention ratio at ACE Global Markets has increased to 70 percent in 2003, compared with 54 percent in 2002 and 60 percent in 2001. The retention ratio was lower in 2002 due to the reinsurance premiums we incurred associated with reinsurance arrangements put into place following a revision of our underwriting strategy and the rebuilding of our reinsurance cover following the September 11 tragedy. Historically, the purchase of reinsurance protection by ACE Global Markets was principally on a whole account basis, and while this approach could have been continued, it was becoming increasingly difficult to acquire economically viable reinsurance protection on this basis. The current reinsurance program is of a more traditional, product line-specific nature. This has resulted in number of advantages, including greater access to participating reinsurance markets, achieving more competitive pricing, greater flexibility and the ability to build capacity and coverage of certain lines. The table below shows net premiums earned by each of the Insurance – Overseas General segment’s key components for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001. (in millions of U.S. dollars) 2003 2002 2001 ACE Europe $ 1,466 $ 925 $ 659 ACE Asia Pacific 390 246 159 ACE Far East 367 335 349 ACE Latin America 297 225 210 ACE International 2,520 1,731 1,377 ACE Global Markets 1,043 662 564 Net premiums earned $ 3,563 $ 2,393 $ 1,941 ACE International’s increase in net premiums earned in 2003 and 2002 is attributed to P&C and A&H lines across all geographical regions, with the exception of ACE Far East, where growth in net premiums written has been minimal. The increase in net premiums earned is principally driven by growth in net premiums written and the appreciation of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar over the last two years. ACE Global Markets’ increase in net premiums earned in 2003 and 2002 is a result of higher net premiums written across most of its product lines, particularly the professional lines, aviation, and property portfolios. The devalued U.S. dollar increased this segment’s net premiums earned by approximately 11 percentage points. The loss and loss expense ratio for Insurance – Overseas General improved slightly in 2003 compared with 2002. Losses for 2003 included $57 million of adverse prior period development, compared with $104 million of adverse development in 2002. Prior period development for 2003 primarily related to casualty lines for ACE International and was a result of lengthening of the loss development patterns for these lines of business. To a lesser extent, ACE Global Markets experienced 2003 adverse development primarily related to marine liability with lower amounts in professional lines, marine hull and bloodstock lines mitigated by positive development on property, energy, aviation and political risk lines of business. 2002 prior period development related primarily to casualty and D&O lines for ACE International and aerospace business for ACE Global Markets. Additionally, this segment incurred $10 million of catastrophe losses in 2003, principally related to hurricanes, while 2002 included $68 million of catastrophe losses related to the European floods. The reduction in the loss and loss expense ratio in 2003 compared with 2002 reflected lower adverse prior period development and lower catastrophe losses mitigated by higher loss ratios for current accident year losses due to changes in business mix. The loss and loss expense ratio for Insurance – Overseas General declined in 2002 compared with 2001. This improvement is attributed to the lack of catastrophe losses of the magnitude of the September 11 tragedy and the casualty reserve strengthening, which increased 2001 losses by $67 million and $170 million, respectively. 41 Table of Contents The policy acquisition cost ratio for Insurance – Overseas General improved in 2003 compared with 2002, primarily due to a change in business mix. The administrative expense ratio for Insurance – Overseas General improved due to the increase in net premiums earned. ACE International’s administrative expenses increased 25 percent in 2003, due mainly to increased costs associated with supporting business growth across all regions of the world. Additionally, the depreciation of the U.S. dollar added $32 million to administrative expenses in 2003. The policy acquisition cost ratio was relatively unchanged in 2002 compared with 2001, while the administrative expense ratio declined due to the increase in net premiums earned outpacing the increase in expenses to support growth in operations. Underwriting income increased in 2003 compared with 2002 primarily due to the increase in net premiums earned and a decrease in catastrophe losses of $58 million. Income excluding net realized gains (losses) increased in 2003 compared with 2002, driven by increased underwriting income and higher net investment income, partially offset by higher income tax expense. The underwriting loss and the loss excluding net realized gains (losses) in 2001 was primarily a result of the September 11 tragedy and the casualty reserve strengthening. Overall, the depreciation of the U.S. dollar accounted for eight percent of Insurance – Overseas General’s net income in 2003. Global Reinsurance The Global Reinsurance segment comprises ACE Tempest Re Bermuda, ACE Tempest Re USA, ACE Tempest Re Europe, and ACE Tempest Life Re (ACE Life Re). ACE Life Re is our Bermuda-based life reinsurance operation and is addressed separately. Property and Casualty Reinsurance (in millions of U.S. dollars) 2003 2002 2001 Gross premiums written $ 1,312 $ 887 $ 460 Net premiums written 1,225 777 354 Net premiums earned 1,100 677 324 Losses and loss expenses 559 304 317 Policy acquisition costs 211 123 68 Administrative expenses 62 40 29 Underwriting income (loss) 268 210 (90 ) Net investment income 87 82 70 Other income (expense) 3 1 – Interest expense – 1 1 Income tax expense (benefit) 14 1 (22 ) Amortization of goodwill – – 14 Income excluding net realized gains (losses) 344 291 (13 ) Net realized gains (losses) 55 (43 ) (18 ) Net income (loss) $ 399 $ 248 $ (31 ) Loss and loss expense ratio 50.9% 44.9% 97.7% Policy acquisition cost ratio 19.2% 18.1% 21.0% Administrative expense ratio 5.6% 5.9% 9.0% Combined ratio 75.7% 68.9% 127.7% Gross premiums written for Global Reinsurance increased 48 percent in 2003 compared with 2002. The Global Reinsurance segment has expanded into a multi-line global reinsurer that offers a diversified portfolio of products. This shift has enabled it to take advantage of the improved P&C market. In 2003, significant production gains were recorded at ACE Tempest Re USA and ACE Tempest Re Europe as these units benefited from higher rates and increased volume for P&C lines. Gross premiums written for this segment increased 93 percent in 2002 compared with 2001. This increase was a result of the improved market for P&C lines, some of which were first offered in 2002, and additionally due to higher property catastrophe premium rates. 42 Table of Contents Global Reinsurance’s net premiums written increased 58 percent in 2003 compared with 2002. The retention ratio for this segment has increased to 93 percent in 2003, compared with 88 percent in 2002. The increase in the retention ratio reflects the decline in reinsurance purchased at ACE Tempest Re Europe and the increasing proportion of ACE Tempest Re USA business, which tends to be written at higher retention ratios than other business in this segment. ACE Tempest Re Europe increased its retention in order to take advantage of improved market conditions. Net premiums written more than doubled in 2002 compared with 2001, primarily as a result of increased production and less reinsurance purchased by ACE Tempest Re Europe. The table below shows net premiums earned by each of the Global Reinsurance segment’s key components for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001. (in millions of U.S. dollars) 2003 2002 2001 ACE Tempest Re USA $ 463 $ 182 $ 42 ACE Tempest Re Europe 259 142 60 ACE Tempest Re Bermuda 378 353 222 Net premiums earned $ 1,100 $ 677 $ 324 Net premiums earned increased 62 percent in 2003 compared with 2002. The increase in net premiums earned in all components is primarily due to the increase in traditional non-catastrophe P&C business. In 2003, 65 percent of net premiums earned was from traditional non-catastrophe P&C business, compared with 46 percent in 2002. The increase in 2002 net premiums earned compared with 2001 follows the increase in net premiums written. The loss and loss expense ratio increased in 2003 compared with 2002, due to the shift in mix of business which resulted in growth in non-catastrophe P&C business at ACE Tempest Re USA and ACE Tempest Re Europe. Non-catastrophe P&C business typically has higher loss ratios than property catastrophe business (except in periods with high catastrophe losses). Property catastrophe business is mainly written at ACE Tempest Re Bermuda. As Global Reinsurance increases non-catastrophe P&C writing, we expect its loss and loss expense ratio to continue to increase in line with what would be expected from a traditional multi-line reinsurer. Global Reinsurance incurred $82 million of catastrophe losses in 2003, compared with $88 million in 2002. Global Reinsurance had favorable prior period development of $27 million in 2003 compared with favorable development of $20 million in 2002, primarily due to the property catastrophe line of business and the losses in this line being lower than expected. The loss and loss expense ratio improved in 2002 as the Global Reinsurance segment was heavily impacted by the September 11 tragedy, which added 67.6 percentage points to the 2001 loss and loss expense ratio. The policy acquisition cost ratio for Global Reinsurance increased due to the higher proportion of business generated from ACE Tempest Re USA, relative to ACE Tempest Re Europe and ACE Tempest Re Bermuda. More of ACE Tempest Re USA’s business is written on a treaty-basis which incurs higher acquisition costs due to higher ceding commissions paid. The administrative expense ratio decreased slightly due to increased net premiums earned partially offset by higher staffing costs to support the growth in business. The policy acquisition cost and administrative expense ratios decreased in 2002 due to the shift in business mix and the increase in net premiums earned, respectively. Global Reinsurance’s underwriting income increased 28 percent in 2003 compared with 2002. The increase is primarily a result of higher net premiums earned in 2003. Underwriting income increased by $300 million in 2002 compared with 2001, due to the impact of the September 11 tragedy on the 2001 results and the improved market conditions in 2002. Income excluding net realized gains (losses) for Global Reinsurance increased 18 percent in 2003 compared with 2002. The increase in 2003 is a result of higher underwriting income and net investment income, partially offset by higher income tax expense. Foreign exchange did not have a material impact on Global Reinsurance’s income excluding gains in 2003. The large increase in income excluding net realized gains (losses) in 2002 compared with 2001 is due to the impact of the September 11 tragedy in 2001 and the improved market conditions in 2002. Life Reinsurance ACE Life Re principally provides reinsurance coverage to other life insurance companies, focusing on guarantees included in certain fixed and variable annuity products. We do not compete on a traditional basis for pure mortality business. The reinsurance transactions we 43 Table of Contents undertake typically help clients – ceding companies – to manage mortality, morbidity, and/or lapse risks embedded in their book of business. We price life reinsurance using actuarial and investment models that incorporate a number of factors, including assumptions for mortality, morbidity, expenses, demographics, persistency, investment returns and inflation. We assess the performance of our life reinsurance business based on income excluding net realized gains (losses). (in millions of U.S. dollars) 2003 2002 2001 Gross premiums written $ 193 $ 165 $ 414 Net premiums written 185 159 408 Net premiums earned 184 158 406 Life and annuity benefits 181 158 401 Policy acquisition costs 16 16 8 Administrative expenses 3 6 2 Net investment income 33 27 9 Income excluding net realized gains (losses) 17 5 4 Net realized gains (losses) (21 ) (14 ) 2 Net income (loss) $ (4 ) $ (9 ) $ 6 ACE Life Re’s gross premiums written increased 17 percent in 2003 compared with 2002. This increase relates mainly to new variable annuity and mortality business. Gross premiums written in 2002 included $59 million of non-recurring business, $55 million of which was group long-term disability business. Gross premiums written decreased 60 percent in 2002 compared with 2001, which included $334 million from non-recurring deals. Income (loss) excluding net realized gains (losses) improved in 2003 due to lower policy acquisition costs and administrative expenses, and higher investment income compared with 2002. Policy acquisition costs decreased due to the growth in life, health and annuity lines, which have lower acquisition costs than the group long-term disability business. Administrative expenses were lower in 2003 due to reduced staff levels. Investment income is higher due to a higher invested asset base, as a result of increased production in 2003. Income (loss) excluding net realized gains (losses) increased in 2002 compared with 2001, primarily due to higher investment income. 44 Table of Contents Financial Services The Financial Services segment consists of two broad categories: financial guaranty and financial solutions. The financial guaranty operations provide insurance and reinsurance for financial guaranty exposures, including municipal and non-municipal obligations, credit default swaps (CDSs), mortgage guaranty reinsurance, title reinsurance, and trade credit reinsurance. The financial solutions operations provide one-off insurance and reinsurance solutions to clients with unique or complex risks, which are not adequately addressed in the traditional insurance market. Each financial solutions contract is structured to meet the needs of each client. Certain products (principally credit protection oriented) issued by the Financial Services segment have been determined to meet the definition of a derivative under FAS 133. The “Critical Accounting Estimates” section has more information relating to these products. (in millions of U.S. dollars) 2003 2002 2001 Gross premiums written $ 1,046 $ 1,537 $ 1,481 Net premiums written 1,039 1,497 1,461 Net premiums earned 1,101 1,127 1,429 Losses and loss expenses 894 947 1,397 Policy acquisition costs 61 72 58 Administrative expenses 84 57 56 Underwriting income (loss) 62 51 (82 ) Net investment income 202 192 173 Other income (expense) – 1 1 Interest expense 6 12 17 Income tax expense 27 30 21 Amortization of goodwill – – 4 Income excluding net realized gains (losses) 231 202 50 Net realized gains (losses) 190 (117 ) (4 ) Tax effect of net realized gains (losses) (37 ) 17 (2 ) Cumulative effect of adopting a new accounting standard – – (23 ) Net income $ 384 $ 102 $ 21 Loss and loss expense ratio 81.2% 84.0% 97.8% Policy acquisition cost ratio 5.5% 6.4% 4.0% Administrative expense ratio 7.7% 5.0% 3.9% Combined ratio 94.4% 95.4% 105.7% Gross premiums written decreased 32 percent in 2003 compared with 2002. This decrease is primarily related to the termination of equity layer CDOs during 2003, which resulted in the recording of negative gross premiums written of $79 million. The financial solutions operations have reduced writing equity layer CDOs, and the financial guaranty operations have ceased writing this line completely due to presently unfavorable pricing terms. Gross premiums written in 2002 were slightly higher than in 2001, due to increased writings of equity layer CDOs, and CDSs, which were partially offset by lower LPT volume. Gross premiums written for the financial guaranty operations increased 30 percent to $510 million in 2003, compared with $391 million in 2002. The municipal line reported strong production growth, benefiting from increased new issue activity, due to low interest rates and also a higher proportion of the new issues are insured. In addition, non-municipal and trade credit lines of business achieved strong production results offset by a decline in mortgage and equity CDO business. The decrease in mortgage gross written premium is partly due to the low interest rate environment that has fueled refinancing activity and resulted in a commensurate reduction in the existing in-force quota share book. Additionally, a non-recurring mortgage transaction was completed in 2002. During the fourth quarter of 2003, we terminated three equity layer CDOs, which resulted in the recording of negative gross premiums written. The policy acquisition cost ratio increased due to a change in business mix whereby a greater portion of the business, specifically municipal, non-municipal and trade credit lines, incurs commission costs. Administrative expenses increased as a result of an increase in staff needed to support the growing direct business and also due to a severance charge associated with the planned IPO. Underwriting income decreased $11 45 Table of Contents million to $37 million in 2003, compared with $48 million in 2002, due to the higher policy acquisition cost and administrative expense ratios. In 2002, the financial guaranty operations increased underwriting income $16 million due to lower losses and loss expenses. Gross premiums written for the financial solutions operations decreased to $536 million in 2003 compared with $1.1 billion in 2002. This reduction relates to the decline in LPTs written and the recording of negative premiums due to the termination of an equity CDO. Additionally, 2002 was bolstered by several large, multi-year prospective, structured programs sold. Net premiums earned for the financial solutions operations decreased to $773 million in 2003, compared with $845 million, in 2002. This decline in net premiums earned is the result of a reduction of retrospective premiums from LPTs, which are fully earned when written, offset, to a large degree, by an increase in net premiums earned from prospective contracts, typically finite and structured risk products for which premiums may be earned over a three to five year effective period. The financial solutions operations reported an increase in underwriting income of $22 million to $25 million in 2003, compared with $3 million in 2002. Underwriting income increased due to changes in mix of business as well as the discontinuation of life business, which typically incurs higher commissions than other business. The administrative expense ratio increased as a result of increased staffing costs. Underwriting income for the financial solutions operations increased $117 million in 2002 compared with 2001, which included an underwriting income impact of $147 million due to the September 11 tragedy. Financial Services reported an increase in income excluding net realized gains (losses) in 2003 compared with 2002. The increase is a result of higher underwriting income and net investment income, and also a reduction in interest expense. Additionally, Financial Services incurred $43 million of adverse prior period development in 2003 principally on the structured finance line of business due to credit deterioration in collateralized debt obligations assumed through reinsurance treaties. In addition, prior year development includes an increase in the case reserve on an auto residual value transaction. Adverse development of $30 million in 2002 was principally from the ACE Financial Solutions International book, which comprises large, unique transactions, including LPTs. The increase in income excluding realized gains (losses) in 2002 compared with 2001, reflects the losses associated with the September 11 tragedy. Following the closing of the planned IPO, we expect Financial Services’ income excluding net realized gains (losses) for 2004 to decrease 15-20 percent compared with 2003. Net Investment Income Years Ended December 31 (in millions of U.S. dollars) 2003 2002 2001 Insurance – North American $ 410 $ 406 $ 426 Insurance – Overseas General 159 108 102 Global Reinsurance – P&C 87 82 70 Global Reinsurance – Life 33 27 9 Financial Services 202 192 173 Corporate and Other (30 ) (13 ) 5 Net investment income $ 861 $ 802 $ 785 Net investment income is influenced by a number of factors, including the amounts and timing of inward and outward cash flows, the level of interest rates, and changes in overall asset allocation. Net investment income increased seven percent in 2003 and two percent in 2002 compared with 2002 and 2001, respectively. The increased net investment income is due to the positive operating cash flows during 2003, 2002 and 2001 that resulted in a higher average invested asset base. This positive impact on investment income was partially offset by a decline in the investment portfolio’s yield, due to the impact of lower interest rates on investment of new cash and reinvestment of maturing securities. The average yield on fixed maturities declined to 4.0 percent at December 31, 2003, compared with 4.4 percent and 5.2 percent at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Net Realized Gains (Losses) Our investment strategy takes a long-term view, and our investment portfolio is actively managed to maximize total return within certain specific guidelines, designed to minimize risk. Our investment portfolio is reported at fair value. The effect of market movements on our investment portfolio impact income (through net realized gains (losses)) when securities are sold, when “other than temporary” impairments are recorded on invested assets or when derivatives, including financial futures and options, interest rate swaps and credit-default 46 Table of Contents swaps, are marked to fair value or are settled. Changes in unrealized appreciation and depreciation, which result from the revaluation of securities held, are reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders’ equity. The following table presents our pre-tax net realized gains (losses) for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001. Years Ended December 31 (in millions of U.S. dollars) 2003 2002 2001 Fixed maturities and short-term investments $ 100 $ (58 ) $ (7 ) Equity securities (41 ) (157 ) 27 Other investments (25 ) (12 ) (38 ) Financial futures, options and interest rate swaps 34 (188 ) (11 ) Fair value adjustment on credit derivatives 163 (77 ) (17 ) Currency 21 3 (12 ) Total net realized gains (losses) $ 252 $ (489 ) $ (58 ) Given our total return objective for our investment portfolio, we may sell securities at a loss due to changes in the investment environment, our expectation that fair value may deteriorate further, our desire to reduce our exposure to an issuer or an industry, and changes in the credit quality of the security. FAS 133 requires us to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet, and measure them at fair value. We record the gains and losses resulting from the fair value measurement of derivatives in net realized gains (losses). We participate in derivative instruments in two principal ways as follows: i) to offer protection to others as the seller or writer of the derivative, such as our credit derivatives business; or ii) to mitigate our own risk, principally arising from our investment holdings. We do not consider either type of transaction to be speculative. For the year ended December 31, 2003, we recorded net realized gains of $197 million on derivative transactions, compared with net realized losses of $265 million and $28 million for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. With respect to our credit derivatives’ business, as explained under “Critical Accounting Estimates,” we record a portion of the change in fair value in the losses and loss expense reserves, representing our best estimate of loss payouts, and a portion in net realized gains (losses), representing other changes in fair value. The fair value adjustment included in net realized gains (losses) in 2003 was a net realized gain of $163 million, compared with net realized losses of $77 million and $17 million in 2002 and 2001, respectively. The change in fair value is related to many factors but primarily due to changes in credit spreads. The gain or loss created by the estimated fair value adjustment will rise or fall each period based on estimated market pricing and may not be an indication of ultimate claims. Fair value is defined as the amount at which an asset or liability could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties. We generally plan to hold derivative financial instruments to maturity. Where we hold derivative financial instruments to maturity, these fair value adjustments would generally be expected to reverse resulting in no gain or loss over the entire term of the contract. However, in the event that we terminate a derivative contract prior to maturity, as a result of a decision to exit a line of business or for risk management purposes, the unrealized gain or loss will be realized through premiums earned and losses incurred. We recorded net realized gains on financial futures and option contracts and interest rate swaps of $34 million in 2003, compared with net realized losses of $188 million and $11 million in 2002 and 2001, respectively. We recorded net realized losses of $6 million on interest rate swaps in 2003, compared with net realized losses of $81 million in 2002. The interest rate swaps are designed to reduce the negative impact of increases in interest rates on our fixed maturity portfolio. We recorded gains of $40 million on our Standard and Poor’s (S&P) equity index futures contracts as the S&P 500 equity index increased 26 percent in 2003. We use foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the effect of fluctuating foreign currencies on certain non-U.S. dollar holdings in our portfolio that are not specifically matching foreign currency liabilities. These contracts are not designated as specific hedges and, in accordance with FAS 133, we record all realized and unrealized gains and losses on these contracts as net realized gains (losses) in the period in which the currency values change. We regularly review our investment portfolio for possible impairment based on criteria including economic conditions, credit loss experience and issuer-specific developments. If there is a decline in a security’s net realizable value, we must determine whether that decline is temporary or “other than temporary”. If we believe a decline in the value of a particular investment is temporary, we record it as an unrealized loss in our shareholders’ equity. If we believe the decline is “other than temporary”, we write down the carrying value of 47 Table of Contents the investment and record a net realized loss in our statement of operations. The decision to recognize a decline in the value of a security carried at fair value as “other than temporary” rather than temporary has no impact on our book value. Once a security is identified as having a potential “other than temporary” impairment, we determine whether or not cost will ultimately be recovered and whether we have the intent and ability to hold the security until an expected recovery period, absent a significant change in facts that is expected to have a material adverse financial effect on the issuer. Our net realized gains (losses) in 2003 included write-downs of $29 million related to fixed maturity investments, $63 million related to equity securities and $29 million related to other investments, as a result of conditions which caused us to conclude the decline in fair value of the investment was “other than temporary”. This compares with write-downs of $101 million related to fixed maturity investments, $153 million related to equity securities and $14 million related to other investments in 2002. Excluding the impairment charges, we recorded $155 million of net gains primarily from the sale of fixed maturities. The process of determining whether a decline in value is temporary or “other than temporary” requires considerable judgment and differs depending on whether or not the security is traded on a public market as well as by type of security. As a result of our periodic review process, we have determined that there currently is no need to sell any of these securities to fund anticipated payments. We have described below, by type of security, our process for reviewing our investments for possible impairment. We review all of our fixed maturity securities, including securities on loan, and equity securities for potential impairment each quarter. Initially, we identify those securities to be evaluated for a potential impairment. In this process, the following is considered by type of security: Fixed Maturities and Equity Securities, including Securities on Loan A security that meets any of the following criteria is to be evaluated for a potential impairment: • securities that have been in a loss position for the previous twelve months; • those securities that have been in a loss position for the previous nine months and market value is less than 80 percent of amortized cost, or cost for equity securities; or • those securities that are rated below investment grade by at least one major rating agency. We evaluate all other fixed maturity and equity securities for a potential impairment when the unrealized loss at the balance sheet date exceeds a certain scope, based on both a percentage (i.e., market value is less than 80 percent of amortized cost, or cost for equity securities) and aggregate dollar decline, and certain indicators of an “other than temporary” impairment are present including: • a significant economic event has occurred that is expected to adversely affect the industry the issuer participates in; • recent issuer-specific news that is likely to have an adverse affect on operating results and cash flows; or • a missed or late interest or principal payment related to any debt issuance. For those securities identified as having a potential “other than temporary” impairment based on the above criteria, we estimate a reasonable period of time in which market value is expected to recover to a level in excess of cost, if at all. For fixed maturity securities, factors considered include: • the degree to which any appearance of impairment is attributable to an overall change in market conditions such as interest rates rather than changes in the individual factual circumstances and risk profile of the issuer; • the performance of the relevant industry sector; • the nature of collateral or other credit support; • whether an issuer is current in making principal and interest payments on the debt securities in question; • the issuer’s financial condition and our assessment (using available market information) of its ability to make future scheduled principal and interest payments on a timely basis; and • current financial strength or debt rating, analysis and guidance provided by rating agencies and analysts. For equity securities, factors considered include: • whether the decline appears to be related to general market or industry conditions or is issuer-specific; and • the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, including specific events that may influence the issuer’s operations. Securities will be assessed to have an “other than temporary” impairment if cost is not expected to be recovered or we do not have the ability and specific intent to hold the security until its expected recovery. We typically make this latter assessment when such intent is considered inconsistent with our investment objectives, such as maximizing total return. 48 Table of Contents Other Investments With respect to other investments that are not traded in a public market, such as venture capital investments, the portfolio managers, as well as our internal valuation committee, consider a variety of factors in determining whether or not the investment should be evaluated for impairment. Indicators of impairment include: • the issuer has reported losses for two consecutive fiscal years; • a significant economic event has occurred that is expected to adversely affect the industry the issuer participates in; • recent issuer-specific news that is expected to adversely affect operating results; and • a missed interest or principal payment related to any debt issuance. For those securities identified as having a possible impairment, we determine a reasonable period of time in which market value is expected to recover to a level in excess of cost, if at all. Factors considered include: • the issuer’s most recent financing events; • an analysis of whether fundamental deterioration has occurred; and • the issuer’s progress, and whether it has been substantially less than expected. These securities will be assessed to have an “other than temporary” impairment if cost is not expected to be recovered or it is concluded that we do not have the ability and specific intent to hold the security until its expected recovery. The following table summarizes for all securities in an unrealized loss position at December 31, 2003 (including securities on loan), the aggregate fair value and gross unrealized loss by length of time the amounts have continuously been in an unrealized loss position. 0 – 12 Months Over 12 Months Total (in millions of U.S. dollars) Fair Value Gross Unrealized Losses Fair Value Gross Unrealized Losses Fair Value Gross Unrealized Losses U.S. Treasury and agency $ 634 $ 6 $ – $ – $ 634 $ 6 Non-U.S. governments 283 5 – – 283 5 Corporate securities 994 17 5 – 999 17 Mortgage-backed securities 1,299 15 – – 1,299 15 States, municipalities and political subdivisions 146 6 – – 146 6 Total fixed maturities 3,356 49 5 – 3,361 49 Equities 38 3 – – 38 3 Other investments – – – – – – Total $ 3,394 $ 52 $ 5 $ – $ 3,399 $ 52 Other Income and Expense Items Years Ended December 31 (in millions of U.S. dollars) 2003 2002 2001 Other income (expense) $ (27 ) $ (21 ) $ 1 Interest expense $ 177 $ 193 $ 199 Income tax expense (benefit) $ 278 $ (116 ) $ (78 ) Amortization of goodwill $ – $ – $ 79 The other expense for 2003 includes $9 million of charges related to the commutation of a reinsurance contract and $12 million in goodwill and software impairments. Other expense for 2002 includes $25 million in debt prepayment expense on the ACE INA Subordinated Notes due in 2009. This cost was primarily attributable to a decline in interest rates since the note was originally issued. 49 Table of Contents The decrease in interest expense is a result of a reduction in average outstanding trust preferred securities in 2003 compared with 2002. This decrease was partly offset due to the impact of the $500 million 6.0 percent notes issued late in the first quarter of 2002. During 2002, we repaid $400 million of trust preferred securities. Interest expense declined in 2002 compared with 2001 due to lower interest rates and a reduction in outstanding debt. The increase in income tax expense is primarily due to the increase in net income in 2003 compared with 2002. Our net realized gains in 2003 compared with net realized losses in 2002 increased income tax expense by $104 million. In addition, the increased profitability for Insurance – Overseas General added $78 million to income tax expense in 2003. Last year’s A&E reserve strengthening resulted in an income tax benefit of $162 million in 2002. We reported an income tax benefit of $78 million in 2001 primarily due to the underwriting loss generated largely by the September 11 tragedy. Our effective tax rate on income excluding net realized gains (losses) for 2003, was 17 percent. Our effective tax rate is dependent upon the mix of earnings from different jurisdictions with various tax rates; a different geographic mix of actual earnings would change the effective tax rate. For further information on taxation, see Note 14 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Investments and Cash Our principal investment objective is to ensure that funds are available to meet our insurance and reinsurance obligations. Within this broad liquidity constraint, the purpose of our investment portfolio’s structure is to maximize total return subject to specifically approved guidelines of overall asset classes, credit quality, and liquidity and volatility of expected returns. Our investment portfolio is invested primarily in fixed income securities with an average credit quality of AA, as rated by the independent investment rating service S&P. The portfolio is externally managed by independent, professional, investment managers. The average duration of our fixed income securities, including the effect of interest rate swaps, is 3.4 years at December 31, 2003, compared with 3.1 at December 31, 2002. Our other investments principally comprise direct investments, investments in investment funds and investments in limited partnerships. The following table identifies our invested assets by type held at fair value and cost/amortized cost at December 31, 2003 and 2002. December 31, 2003 December 31, 2002 (in millions of U.S. dollars) Fair Value Cost/ AmortizedCost Fair Value Cost/ AmortizedCost Fixed maturities $ 18,645 $ 18,006 $ 14,420 $ 13,791 Securities on loan 684 650 293 286 Short-term investments 2,928 2,928 2,270 2,270 Cash 562 562 663 663 22,819 22,146 17,646 17,010 Equity securities 544 401 411 442 Other investments 645 602 652 622 Total investments and cash $ 24,008 $ 23,149 $ 18,709 $ 18,074 We also gain exposure to equity markets through the use of derivative instruments. The combined equity exposure through both our equity portfolio and derivative instruments was valued at $662 million and $603 million at December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002, respectively. The increase of $5.3 billion in total investments and cash is due to positive cash flows from operations as a result of strong premium volume, increased unrealized gains, increased securities lending collateral and the issuance of preferred shares. Offsetting these increases were dividends paid of $231 million in 2003. 50 Table of Contents The following tables show the market value of our fixed maturities, short-term investments, securities on loan and cash at December 31, 2003. The first table lists elements according to type, and the second according to S&P credit rating.

At December 31, 2003, our fixed income investment portfolio included below-investment grade securities and non-rated securities which, in total, comprised approximately eight percent of our fixed income portfolio. We define a security as being below-investment grade if it has an S&P credit rating of BB or less. Our below investment-grade and non-rated portfolio includes approximately 500 names, with the top ten holdings making up approximately 11 percent of the $1.8 billion balance at December 31, 2003. The highest single exposure in this portfolio of securities is $26 million. Below-investment grade securities have different characteristics than investment grade corporate debt securities. Risk of loss from default by the borrower is greater with below-investment grade securities. Below-investment grade securities are generally unsecured and are often subordinated to other creditors of the issuer. Also, issuers of below-investment grade securities usually have higher levels of debt and are more sensitive to adverse economic conditions such as recession or increasing interest rates, than are investment grade issuers. We reduce the overall risk in the below-investment grade portfolio, as in all investments, through careful credit analysis, strict investment policy guidelines, and diversification by issuer and/or guarantor as well as by industry. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements – Variable Interests Related to Equity Investments in CDOs As a complement to our credit default swap business and with the objective of enhancing investment yield, we invested in the equity tranches of six CDOs from June 2001 through August 2002. Our aggregate maximum exposure under these CDOs is $43.8 million, which approximates the cost of these investments. At December 31, 2003, the underlying assets in these CDOs, which aggregate to $2.6 billion for all six CDOs, are principally invested in asset-backed securities, including investments in the debt tranches of other CDOs. While management considers the related entities to be variable interest entities, as defined by FIN 46, “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an Interpretation of ARB No. 51,” our equity investments represent a small portion of the variable interests in each CDO. Accordingly, under FIN 46, we are not required to consolidate any of these entities. At December 31, 2003, our aggregate carrying 51 Table of Contents value for these investments is $29.1 million, which represents our remaining loss exposure related to these investments as of December 31, 2003. From January 1, 2004 through February 11, 2004, we sold four of these six positions, representing $16.1 million of our year end carrying value and $1.9 billion of the aforementioned $2.6 billion of aggregate assets in all six CDOs. Restricted Assets We are required to maintain assets on deposit with various regulatory authorities to support our insurance and reinsurance operations. These requirements are generally promulgated in the statutory regulations of the individual jurisdictions. The assets on deposit are available to settle insurance and reinsurance liabilities. We also utilize trust funds in certain large transactions where the trust funds are set up for the benefit of the ceding companies and generally take the place of Letter of Credit (LOC) requirements. We also have investments in segregated portfolios primarily to provide collateral or guarantees for LOCs and debt instruments. (See Notes 7 and 8 of the Consolidated Financial Statements) The following table identifies the value of restricted assets at December 31, 2003 and 2002. (in millions of U.S. dollars) 2003 2002 Deposits with U.S. regulatory authorities $ 908 $ 650 Deposits with non-U.S. regulatory authorities 1,303 1,070 Assets used for collateral or guarantees 1,141 1,230 Trust funds 1,707 1,381 $ 5,059 $ 4,331 The value of restricted assets increased $728 million to $5.1 billion at December 31, 2003. The higher value of restricted assets is a result of increased use of our secured credit facility and the higher use of trust funds in place of LOCs. Unpaid Losses and Loss Expenses We establish reserves for the estimated unpaid ultimate liability for losses and loss expenses under the terms of our policies and agreements. These reserves take into account estimates both for claims that have been reported and for IBNR, and include estimates of expenses associated with processing and settling claims. The table below presents a rollforward of our unpaid losses and loss expenses for the year ended December 31, 2003. (in millions of U.S. dollars) Gross Losses ReinsuranceRecoverable Net Losses Balance at December 31, 2002 $ 24,315 $ 12,997 $ 11,318 Losses and loss expenses incurred 10,265 4,148 6,117 Losses and loss expenses paid (8,213 ) (4,308 ) (3,905 ) Other (including foreign exchange revaluation) 788 355 433 Balance at December 31, 2003 $ 27,155 $ 13,192 $ 13,963 Note 5 of our Consolidated Financial Statements includes a reconciliation of our beginning and ending net losses and loss adjustment expense reserves for each of the three years ended December 31, 2003, 2002, and 2001. The reserve for unpaid losses and loss expenses increased by $2.8 billion to $27.1 billion at December 31, 2003 compared with $24.3 billion at December 31, 2002. This increase is attributed to the significant growth in business in 2003. The balance at December 31, 2003, includes $13.9 billion of IBNR compared with $11.3 billion at December 31, 2002. Our net incurred losses in 2003 were $6.1 billion, compared with $4.9 billion in 2002. Net losses and loss expenses incurred for 2003 and 2002 include $164 million and $709 million of prior period development, respectively. In 2002, we incurred $516 million of prior period development related to A&E. More information regarding prior period development is included in the Segment Operating Results section. 52 Table of Contents We have exposure to catastrophic event risk from global (re)insurance writings of property, workers’ compensation and other lines of business. This potential loss accumulation, caused by either man-made or natural events, is addressed within using several different approaches. First, we have established a series of Product Boards to ensure that geographic, product and client exposures are appropriate and meet limit guidelines adopted by the Boards. Second, we have adopted since 1999 a standardized catastrophe exposure modeling approach across each of its underwriting operations which allows the aggregation of risk within and across business units. This aggregation is performed and monitored on a quarterly basis to provide a level assessment of risk. Third, where the risk/return economics are effective, reinsurance is purchased at the business unit level to protect from accumulations arising either within product, business unit or across a combination thereof such that the overall risk from a catastrophic loss is appropriate to our capital structure. In 2001, we incurred net losses of $650 million relating to the September 11 tragedy. At December 31, 2003, we had paid $1 billion of losses related to the September 11 tragedy and collected $684 million or 96 percent of the $708 million billed to reinsurers. Our net unpaid loss in connection with the September 11 tragedy was $323 million at December 31, 2003. We continue to evaluate our total potential liability based upon individual insurance and reinsurance policy language, legal and factual developments in underlying matters involving our insureds, relevant court decisions and legislative developments in the U.S. involving the terrorist attack. If our current assessments of future developments are proven wrong, the financial impact of any of them, singularly or in the aggregate, could be material. For each of our lines of business, management, in conjunction with internal actuaries, develop a “best estimate” of ultimate liabilities, which they believe provide a reasonable estimate of the required reserve. The following is a discussion of our reserve- setting procedures by segment: Insurance – North American and Insurance – Overseas General Our internal actuaries perform standard actuarial methodologies including paid and incurred loss development and the Bornhuetter-Ferguson (BF) incurred and paid loss methods. The BF method is a blend of an expected loss ratio method and utilization of a pattern consistent with that of a loss development technique. For those lines of business where there is enough historical experience, in general, all four methods are utilized and an ultimate indication is estimated based on the outcomes of these techniques as well as any other methods used for the given line of business (e.g. counts and averages approaches). More reliance would be placed on loss development techniques for the older years as these are more mature and would have more consistent trends. For the more recent years, especially for long-tailed lines of business, a BF method would be given more weight as these immature years are highly leveraged and in many cases a development method could significantly understate or overstate liabilities. In all cases, additional diagnostics are performed to help in the determination of the most appropriate estimate. These diagnostics include a review of paid loss to incurred loss ratios, claims disposal rates and implied IBNR to case outstanding ratios. In situations where a new line of business is being written or a new product line being sold, an expected loss ratio method would be more appropriate as our own historical loss development information is limited. In these cases, industry benchmark loss ratios and development patterns are utilized to estimate ultimate indications. Given the high severity, low frequency nature of ACE Bermuda’s book of business, the actuarial techniques utilized in calculating IBNR is more heavily weighted to an expected loss ratio/BF methodology. There is intense monitoring by claim of potential case reserve development in this business and the interaction between the claims department and actuarial function is a crucial element in the success of this operating unit. Global Reinsurance ACE Global Re’s book of business consists of a significant amount of property catastrophe exposure. For this line of business, we develop initial loss estimates for large individual catastrophes based on market share information of potential exposures. Market share analysis uses cedant and industry information at geographic level (e.g. country) and line of business. A range of industry losses is then passed through the relevant market shares to provide a range of losses for the company’s exposures, allowing for program attachment points and the appropriate shares of the indemnity limits involved. When actual case reserves from the ceding companies are received, the initial loss estimates are progressively modified to reflect the actual emerging loss experience. Since the subject business is short tail, most of our historical losses are now reserved on this basis. For the casualty lines of business, similar actuarial techniques are utilized as described above for the Insurance – North American and Insurance – Overseas General segments. However, due to the 53 Table of Contents immaturity of this book of business, more weight is given to the BF method of projections. There is considerable uncertainty around the expected projections for these lines and any favorable trends that may be seen in the development could easily be reversed. Financial Services Financial Guaranty For the financial guaranty reinsurance and mortgage guaranty reinsurance businesses, unpaid losses and loss expenses principally consist of case reserves and portfolio reserves. Incurred but not reported reserves are generally limited to mortgage guaranty reinsurance assumed through quota share treaties, which represent a relatively small portion of these businesses. Case reserves are established when specific insured obligations are in or near default. Case reserves represent the present value of expected future loss payments and loss expenses, net of estimated recoveries but before considering ceded reinsurance. Financial guaranty insurance and reinsurance case reserves are discounted at 6.0 percent, which is the approximate taxable equivalent yield on the investment portfolio in all periods presented. We also record portfolio reserves for our financial guaranty and mortgage guaranty businesses. Portfolio reserves are established with respect to the portion of our business for which case reserves have not been established. Portfolio reserves are established in an amount equal to the portion of actuarially estimated ultimate losses related to premiums earned to date as a percentage of total expected premiums for that in-force business. Portfolio reserves are developed considering the net par outstanding of each insured obligation, taking account of the probability of future default, the expected timing of the default and the expected recovery following default. These factors vary by type of issue (for example municiple, structured finance corporate), current credit rating and remaining term of the underlying obligation and are principally based on historical data obtained from rating agencies. Actuarially estimated ultimate losses on mortgage guaranty reinsurance are principally determined based on the historical industry loss experience, net of recoveries. During an accounting period, portfolio reserves principally increase or decrease based on changes in aggregate net amount at risk and the probability of default resulting from changes in credit quality of insured obligations, if any. Financial Solutions With respect to our financial solutions business, each contract we write is relatively large and unique, so each contract is reviewed and assessed individually. Most contracts are multi-year in nature. As with our financial guaranty business, traditional actuarial methods such as analyzing and extrapolating historical loss experience are not considered appropriate for financial solutions business because of the relatively small number of large contracts. Our loss estimates are based on contract terms (such as a requirement to pay profit commissions) original pricing information, analysis and comparison with external data and experience to date on the contract. Reinsurance One of the ways we manage our loss exposure is through the use of reinsurance. While reinsurance agreements are designed to limit our losses from large exposures and permit recovery of a portion of direct unpaid losses, reinsurance does not relieve us of liability to our insureds. Accordingly, the losses and loss expense reserves on our balance sheet represent our total unpaid gross losses. The reinsurance recoverable represents anticipated recoveries of a portion of those gross unpaid losses as well as amounts recoverable from reinsurers with respect to claims paid. The table below presents our net reinsurance recoverable at December 31, 2003 and 2002. (in millions of U.S. dollars) December 31 2003 December 31 2002 Reinsurance recoverable on paid losses and loss expenses $ 1,277 $ 1,363 Bad debt reserve on paid losses and loss expenses (403 ) (378 ) Reinsurance recoverable on future policy benefits 15 9 Reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses and loss expenses 13,749 13,558 Bad debt reserve on unpaid losses and loss expenses (557 ) (561 ) Net reinsurance recoverable $ 14,081 $ 13,991 We evaluate the financial condition of our reinsurers and potential reinsurers on a regular basis and also monitor concentrations of credit risk with reinsurers. The provision for uncollectible reinsurance is required principally due to the failure of reinsurers to indemnify us, 54 Table of Contents primarily because of disputes under reinsurance contracts and insolvencies. Provisions have been established for amounts estimated to be uncollectible. Following is a breakdown of our reinsurance recoverable on paid losses at December 31, 2003 and 2002: December 31, 2003 December 31, 2002 (in millions of U.S. dollars) Amount Bad DebtReserve % of TotalReserve Amount Bad DebtReserve % of TotalReserve Category General collections $ 730 $ 45 6.2% $ 848 $ 43 5.1% Other 547 358 65.4% 515 335 65.0% Total $ 1,277 $ 403 31.6% $ 1,363 $ 378 27.7% The general collections category represents amounts in the process of collection in the normal course of business. These are balances for which we have no indication of dispute or credit-related issues. The other category includes amounts recoverable that are in dispute, or are from companies in supervision, rehabilitation or liquidation. Our estimation of this reserve considers the credit quality of the reinsurer and whether we have received collateral or other credit protections, such as parental guarantees. The following tables provide a listing of our largest reinsurers with the first category representing the top ten reinsurers and the second category representing the remaining reinsurers with balances greater than $20 million. The third category includes amounts due from over 2,500 companies, each having balances of less than $20 million. Our bad debt reserve in the three categories is principally based on an analysis of the credit quality of the reinsurer and collateral balances. The next category, mandatory pools and government agencies, includes amounts backed by certain state and federal agencies. In certain states, insurance companies are required by law to participate in these pools. The fifth category, structured settlements, includes annuities purchased from life insurance companies to settle claims. Since we retain the ultimate liability in the event that the life company fails to pay the claimant, we reflect the amount as a liability and as a recoverable for GAAP purposes. These amounts are not subject to dispute and we establish our bad debt reserve based on the application of historical collection experience. The next category, captives, includes companies established and owned by our insurance clients to assume a significant portion of their direct insurance risk from us, i.e., they are structured to allow clients to self-insure a portion of their insurance risk. It is generally our policy to obtain collateral equal to expected losses; where appropriate, exceptions are granted, but only with review and sign-off at a senior officer level. Our final category, other, includes amounts recoverable that are in dispute or are from companies that are in supervision, rehabilitation or liquidation. We establish our bad debt reserve for these categories based on a case by case analysis of individual situations, including credit and collateral analysis and consideration of our collection experience in similar situations. 55 Table of Contents Breakdown of Reinsurance Recoverable (in millions of U.S. dollars) December 312003 Bad DebtReserve % of Gross Categories Top 10 reinsurers $ 7,798 $ 84 1.1 % Other reinsurers balances greater than $20 million 3,373 147 4.4 % Other reinsurers balances less than $20 million 979 150 15.3 % Mandatory pools and government agencies 779 4 0.5 % Structured settlements 429 2 0.5 % Captives 801 1 0.1 % Other 882 572 64.9 % Total $ 15,041 $ 960 6.4 % Top 10 Reinsurers (net of collateral) AXA Berkshire Hathaway Insurance Group CIGNA EQUITAS GE Global Insurance Group Hannover Lloyd’s of London Munich Re St. Paul Companies Swiss Re Group Other Reinsurers Balances Greater Than $20 million (net of collateral) ABB Group Fairfax Financial QBE Insurance AIOI Insurance FM Global Group RenaissanceRe Holdings Ltd.

WR Berkley Corp. Dominion Ins. Co. Ltd Overseas Partners Ltd. XL Capital Group Electric Insurance Company Partner Reinsurance Company of the U.S. Zurich Financial Services Group Everest Re Group PMA Capital Insurance Company Asbestos and Environmental Claims Included in our liabilities for losses and loss expenses are amounts for A&E. These A&E liabilities principally relate to claims arising from remediation costs associated with hazardous waste sites and bodily-injury claims related to asbestos products and environmental hazards. These amounts include provision for both reported and IBNR claims. Our exposure to asbestos principally arises out of liabilities acquired when we purchased Westchester Specialty in 1998 and the P&C business of CIGNA in 1999, with the larger exposure contained within the liabilities acquired in the CIGNA transaction. These CIGNA 56 Table of Contents transaction liabilities reside in various subsidiaries of Brandywine, which was created in 1995 by the restructuring of CIGNA’s domestic operations into separate ongoing and run-off operations. As part of the acquisition of Westchester Specialty, NICO provided $750 million of reinsurance protection for adverse development on loss and loss adjustment expense reserves. At December 31, 2003, the remaining unused limit in this NICO Westchester Specialty cover was approximately $600 million. As part of the acquisition of the CIGNA P&C business, NICO provided $2.5 billion of reinsurance protection for adverse development on Brandywine loss and loss adjustment expense reserves and for uncollectible ceded reinsurance. This NICO Brandywine cover was exhausted on an incurred basis with the increase in our A&E reserves in the fourth quarter of 2002. The active ACE INA companies retain two primary funding obligations associated with the run-off Brandywine operations: a dividend retention fund obligation and required reinsurance coverage provided under an aggregate excess of loss reinsurance agreement. In addition, certain active ACE INA companies remain residually liable for pre-1987 general liability business ceded by those companies to the primary Brandywine subsidiary, Century Indemnity Company (“Century”). In accordance with the Brandywine restructuring order, INA Financial Corporation established and funded a dividend retention fund consisting of $50 million plus investment earnings. Pursuant to terms of the restructuring, the full balance of this dividend retention fund was contributed to Century as of December 31, 2002. To the extent in the future that dividends are paid by INA Holdings Corporation to its parent, INA Financial Corporation, and to the extent that INA Financial Corporation then pays such dividends to INA Corporation, a portion of those dividends must be withheld to replenish the principal of the dividend retention fund to $50 million within five years. In 2003, no such dividends were paid, and therefore no replenishment of the dividend retention fund occurred. This dividend fund obligation, to maintain and to replenish the fund as necessary and to the extent dividends are paid, is ongoing until ACE INA receives prior written approval from the Pennsylvania Commissioner of Insurance to terminate the fund. In addition, the ACE INA insurance subsidiaries are obligated to provide insurance coverage to Century in the amount of $800 million under an aggregate excess of loss reinsurance agreement if the statutory capital and surplus of Century falls below $25 million or if Century lacks liquid assets with which to pay claims as they become due, after giving effect to contribution of any dividend retention fund balance. Coverage under the aggregate excess of loss reinsurance agreement was triggered as of December 31, 2002 following contribution of the dividend retention fund balance. Approximately $468 million in undiscounted losses were ceded to the aggregate excess of loss reinsurance agreement at December 31, 2003. In a lawsuit filed in the state of California in December 1999, certain competitors of ACE USA have challenged the restructuring that resulted in the creation of Brandywine. The restructuring was previously upheld by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in July 1999. The lawsuit alleges that the restructuring does not effectively relieve the insurance subsidiary that issued the policies prior to the restructuring (Insurance Company of North America) from liabilities for claims on those policies by California policyholders. The California trial court has held in response to a pre-trial motion that a California statute does prohibit the transfer of California policies to a subsequent legal entity without the consent of the policyholders and noted that consent was not received in the context of the Brandywine restructuring. ACE intends to appeal this decision. In addition, the liabilities that are the subject of this California lawsuit are included within our A&E reserves for Brandywine. Congress has been working on possible legislation to move all U.S. asbestos bodily-injury claims to a federal trust for compensation in accordance with an established set of medical criteria and claim values. The trust would be funded by asbestos defendants and their insurers. As currently proposed, ACE would be one of the insurer participants. We believe that if the proposed legislation is enacted, our ultimate funding obligation under the trust would be less than we would be required to pay under the current tort system because the trust would avoid payments to unimpaired victims and obviate the need for extensive legal costs. However, we cannot predict if any such proposed legislation will be modified or adopted. 57 Table of Contents The table below presents selected loss reserve data for A&E exposures at December 31, 2003 and 2002. December 31, 2003 December 31, 2002 (in millions of U.S. dollars) Gross Net Gross Net Asbestos $ 2,899 $ 277 $ 3,192 $ 446 Environmental and other latent exposures 1,148 250 1,352 403 Total $ 4,047 $ 527 $ 4,544 $ 849 Paid losses for the year ended December 31, 2003 for asbestos claims were $293 million on gross reserves and $169 million on net reserves. Environmental and other latent exposure claim payments were $204 million on gross reserves and $153 million on net reserves in 2003. Survival ratios attempt to measure the adequacy of A&E loss reserves by taking the current ending loss reserve and dividing by the average annual claim payments for the prior three years. We believe this to be a simplistic measure of a very complicated issue. However, we understand this ratio is used as a means to compare companies with A&E exposures. Thus, if we average our last three years of gross A&E claim payments and expect payments to continue at the same pace, our gross survival ratio is 10.3 years. Using the 2003 calendar year payments, our net survival ratio is 9.9 years. The current year survival ratios are adversely affected by the timing of certain previously agreed upon settlements. These settlements were anticipated in our 2002 asbestos study. Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity Liquidity is a measure of a company’s ability to generate cash flows sufficient to meet short-term and long-term cash requirements of its business operations. As a holding company, ACE possesses assets that consist primarily of the stock of its subsidiaries, and of other investments. In addition to net investment income, our cash flows currently depend primarily on dividends or other statutorily permissible payments. Historically, these dividends and other payments have come from our Bermuda-based operating subsidiaries, which we refer to as our Bermuda subsidiaries. During the year ended December 31, 2003, we were able to meet all of our obligations, including the payment of dividends declared on our ordinary shares and preferred shares, with our net cash flow and dividends received. Should the need arise, we generally have access to the debt markets and other available credit facilities that are discussed below. The payments of dividends or other statutorily permissible distributions from our operating companies are subject to the laws and regulations applicable to each jurisdiction, as well as the need to maintain capital levels adequate to support the insurance and reinsurance operations, including financial strength ratings issued by independent rating agencies, which are discussed later. We assess which subsidiaries to draw dividends from based on a number of factors. Considerations such as regulatory and legal restrictions as well as the subsidiary’s financial condition are paramount to the dividend decision. The legal restrictions on the payment of dividends from retained earnings by our Bermuda subsidiaries are currently satisfied by the share capital and additional paid-in capital of each of the Bermuda subsidiaries. During 2003, ACE Bermuda declared and paid dividends of $478 million, compared with $345 million and $234 million in 2002 and 2001, respectively. We received dividends of $25 million from ACE Cap Re International Ltd. during 2003. ACE Tempest Life Re declared and paid dividends of $140 million and $105 million in 2002 and 2001, respectively. We expect that a majority of our cash inflows for 2004 will be from our Bermuda subsidiaries. The payment of any dividends from ACE Global Markets or its subsidiaries would be subject to applicable U.K. insurance laws and regulations including those promulgated by the Society of Lloyd’s. ACE INA’s and ACE Financial Services’ U.S. insurance subsidiaries may pay dividends, without prior regulatory approval, only from earned surplus and subject to certain annual limitations and the maintenance of a minimum capital requirement. ACE INA’s international subsidiaries are also subject to insurance laws and regulations particular to the countries in which the subsidiaries operate. These laws and regulations include restrictions that limit the amount of dividends payable without prior approval of regulatory insurance authorities. We did not receive any dividends from ACE Global Markets or ACE INA in 2003. Under the Lloyd’s accounting model, syndicates in Lloyd’s operate each year as an annual venture. Each year of account is held open for three years. At the end of three years, the year of account purchases reinsurance from the next open year, which is known as reinsurance to close or RITC, and distributes the remaining funds to the investors in the syndicate. ACE Global Markets has historically retained these funds for operational purposes. ACE INA 58 Table of Contents issued debt to provide partial financing for the ACE INA acquisition and for other operating needs. This debt is serviced by dividends paid by ACE INA’s insurance subsidiaries to ACE INA as well as other group resources. ACE Financial Services’ U.S. insurance subsidiaries are limited in their dividend paying abilities due to their need to maintain their AA and AAA financial strength ratings. Our consolidated sources of funds consist primarily of net premiums written, net investment income and proceeds from sales and maturities of investments. Funds are used primarily to pay claims, operating expenses, dividends and for the purchase of investments. After satisfying our cash requirements, excess cash flows from these underwriting and investing activities are invested. Our insurance and reinsurance operations provide liquidity in that premiums are received in advance, sometimes substantially in advance, of the time claims are paid. Our consolidated net cash flows from operating activities were $4.2 billion in 2003 compared with $2.4 billion and $1.4 billion in 2002 and 2001, respectively. The positive operating cash flows were generated from an increase in net premiums written of $2.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2003, and relatively stable net losses and loss expenses paid compared with 2002. The increase in 2002 compared with 2001 was primarily due to the $1.7 billion increase in net premiums written. Generally cash flows are affected by claim payments that, due to the nature of our operations, may comprise large loss payments on a limited number of claims and therefore can fluctuate significantly from year to year. The irregular timing of these loss payments can create significant variations in cash flows from operations between periods. Sources of liquidity include cash from operations, financing arrangements or routine sales of investments. Our consolidated net cash flows used for investing activities increased to $4.7 billion in 2003, compared with $1.9 billion in 2002. This increase primarily reflects our strong consolidated net cash flows from operating activities in 2003. Net cash flows used for investing activities decreased to $1.9 billion in 2002 compared with $2.2 billion in 2001. This decrease is primarily due to our debt repayment activity in 2002, which reduced net cash available for investment. Our consolidated net cash flows from financing activities were $395 million in 2003, compared with usage of $491 million in 2002. The increase is primarily due to the net proceeds from the issuance of preferred shares in 2003, compared with the repayment of trust preferred securities and short-term debt in 2002. We reported consolidated net cash flows from financing activities of $896 million in 2001, primarily due to the net proceeds from the issuance of ordinary shares. Although our ongoing operations continue to generate positive cash flows, our cash flows are currently impacted by a large book of loss reserves from businesses in run-off. The run-off operations generated negative operating cash flows of $645 million in 2003, compared with $525 million and $614 million in 2002 and 2001, respectively, primarily due to claim payments. Both internal and external forces influence our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Claim settlements, premium levels and investment returns may be impacted by changing rates of inflation and other economic conditions. In many cases, significant periods of time, ranging up to several years or more, may lapse between the occurrence of an insured loss, the reporting of the loss to us and the settlement of the liability for that loss. We believe that our cash balances, cash flow from operations, routine sales of investments and the liquidity provided by our credit facilities, as discussed below are adequate to meet expected cash requirements. ACE and its subsidiaries are assigned debt and financial strength (insurance) ratings from internationally recognized rating agencies, including S&P, A.M. Best, Moody’s Investors Service and Fitch IBCA. The ratings issued on our companies by these agencies are announced publicly and are available directly from the agencies. Our website, acelimited.com, also contains some information about our ratings, which you can find under the “Investor Information” tab. Financial strength ratings represent the opinions of the rating agencies on the financial strength of a company and its capacity to meet the obligations of insurance policies. Independent ratings are one of the important factors that establish our competitive position in the insurance markets. The rating agencies consider many factors in determining the financial strength rating of an insurance company, including the relative level of statutory surplus necessary to support the business operations of the company. These ratings are based upon factors relevant to policyholders, agents and intermediaries and are not directed toward the protection of investors. Such ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold securities. Debt ratings apply to short- and long-term debt as well as preferred stock. These ratings are assessments of the likelihood that we will make timely payments of principal and interest and preferred stock dividends. It is possible that, in the future, one or more of the rating agencies may reduce our existing ratings. If one or more of our ratings were downgraded, we could incur higher borrowing costs and our ability to access the capital markets could be impacted. In addition, our insurance and reinsurance operations could be adversely impacted by a downgrade in our financial strength ratings, including a possible reduction in demand for our products in certain markets. 59 Table of Contents Capital Resources Capital resources consist of funds deployed or available to be deployed to support our business operations. The following table summarizes the components of our capital resources at December 31, 2003 and 2002. (in millions of U.S. dollars) December 312003 December 312002 Short-term debt $ 546 $ 146 Long-term debt 1,349 1,749 Total debt 1,895 1,895 Trust preferred securities 475 475 Mezzanine equity – 311 Preferred shares 557 – Ordinary shareholders’ equity 8,278 6,389 Total shareholders’ equity 8,835 6,389 Total capitalization $ 11,205 $ 9,070 Ratio of debt to total capitalization 16.9% 20.9% Ratio of debt plus trust preferreds to total capitalization 21.2% 26.1% We believe our financial strength provides us with the flexibility and capacity to obtain funds externally through debt or equity financing on both a short-term and long-term basis. Our ability to access the capital markets is dependent on, among other things, market conditions and our perceived financial strength. We have accessed both the debt and equity markets from time to time. Mezzanine Equity In 2000, we publicly offered and issued 6,221,000 FELINE PRIDES for aggregate net proceeds of $311 million. Each FELINE PRIDE initially consisted of a unit referred to as an Income PRIDE. Each Income PRIDE consisted of (i) one 8.25 percent Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Share, Series A, liquidation preference $50 per share, and (ii) a purchase contract pursuant to which the holder of the Income PRIDE agreed to purchase from us, on May 16, 2003, $311 million of ordinary shares at the applicable settlement rate. On May 16, 2003, we issued approximately 11.8 million ordinary shares, in satisfaction of the purchase contracts underlying our FELINE PRIDES. In consideration, on June 16, 2003, we redeemed all of our 8.25 percent Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares, Series A, at a rate representing an issuance of 1.8991 ordinary shares per preferred share. Shareholders’ Equity The following table analyzes the movements in our shareholders’ equity for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002, and 2001. (in millions of U.S. dollars) 2003 2002 2001 Balance, beginning of year $ 6,389 $ 6,107 $ 5,420 Net income (loss) 1,417 77 (147 ) Change in net unrealized appreciation on investments 208 339 35 Issuance of Preferred Shares 557 – – Conversion of Mezzanine equity 311 – – Dividends declared – Ordinary Shares (204 ) (173 ) (138 ) Dividends declared – Mezzanine equity (10 ) (26 ) (26 ) Dividends declared – Preferred Shares (23 ) – – Cumulative translation adjustments 108 (1 ) (2 ) Other movements, net 82 66 17 Ordinary Shares issued in share offering – – 1,127 Repurchase of Ordinary Shares – – (179 ) Balance, end of year $ 8,835 $ 6,389 $ 6,107 60 Table of Contents In May 2003, we sold in a public offering 23 million depositary shares, each representing one-tenth of one of our 7.80 percent Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares for $25 per depositary share for net proceeds of $557 million. Gross proceeds from the sale of the preferred shares were $575 million and related expenses were $18 million. We used the net proceeds to make additional capital contributions to some of our subsidiaries and for general corporate purposes. This offering was made under our universal shelf registration statement with the SEC, which became effective in February 2003, allowing us to offer a number of different types of debt and equity securities up to a total offering price of $1.5 billion. Dividends on the preferred shares are payable quarterly, when and if declared by our Boards of Directors, in arrears on March 1, June 1, September 1 and December 1 of each year. On September 1, 2003 and December 1, 2003 we paid dividends of $4.9292 and $4.8750 per preferred share to shareholders of record on August 31, 2003 and November 30, 2003, respectively. Our diluted book value per ordinary share increased to $29.46 at December 31, 2003, compared with $24.16 at December 31, 2002. In calculating our diluted book value per ordinary share, we include in the denominator in-the-money options together with the 11.8 million shares issued upon conversion of the FELINE PRIDES. The expected proceeds from the in-the-money options are included in the numerator. Shareholders’ equity increased by $2.4 billion in 2003, compared with 2002. This increase is due to the issuance of the preferred shares; our net income, conversion of the FELINE PRIDES which increased shareholder’s equity by $311 million, and unrealized gains on our investment portfolio of $208 million. Partially offsetting these increases, were $236 million of dividends declared on mezzanine equity, ordinary and preferred shares in 2003. As part of our capital management program, in November 2001, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of any ACE issued debt or capital securities including ordinary shares, up to $250 million. At December 31, 2003, this authorization had not been utilized. On January 10, 2003 and April 14, 2003, we paid dividends of 17 cents per ordinary share to shareholders of record on December 27, 2002 and March 31, 2003, respectively. On July 14, 2003 and October 14, 2003 and January 14, 2004 we paid dividends of 19 cents per ordinary share to shareholders of record on June 30, 2003, September 30, 2003 and December 31, 2003 respectively. We have paid dividends each quarter since we became a public company in 1993. However, the declaration, payment and value of future dividends on ordinary shares is at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will be dependent upon our profits, financial requirements and other factors, including legal restrictions on the payment of dividends and such other factors as our Board of Directors deems relevant. Contractual Obligations and Commitments The table below shows our contractual obligations and commitments including our payments due by period: Payments Due By Period (in millions of U.S. dollars) Total Less than1 Year 1-3 Years 4-5 Years After 5Years Contract holder deposit funds $ 94 $ 35 $ 27 $ 20 $ 12 Operating leases 424 75 119 75 155 Short-term debt 546 546 – – – Long-term debt 1,349 – 300 749 300 Trust preferred securities 475 – – – 475 Total contractual obligations and commitments $ 2,888 $ 656 $ 446 $ 844 $ 942 The above table excludes estimated future cash flows for losses and loss expenses as there is typically no minimum contractual commitment associated with insurance and reinsurance contracts and also the amount and timing of the cash outflows are uncertain. Further, the above table excludes pension obligations. While we expect to contribute approximately $10 million to our defined benefit plans during 2004, minimum funding requirements are minimal over the next year. Subsequent funding commitments are apt to vary for many factors and are difficult to estimate at this time. 61 Table of Contents Contract Holder Deposit Funds Deposit liabilities of $212 million include contract holder deposit funds of $94 million and reinsurance deposit liabilities of $118 million. Contract holder deposit funds represent a liability for investment contracts sold that do not meet the definition of an insurance contract under FAS No. 97, “Accounting and Reporting by Insurance Enterprises for Certain Long-Duration Contracts and Realized Gains and Losses from the Sale of Investments”. The investment contracts are sold with a guaranteed rate of return. The proceeds are then invested with the intent of realizing a greater return than is called for in the investment contracts. The above table does not include estimated cash flows for deposit liabilities as the amount and timing of cash flows is uncertain. Operating Lease Commitments We lease office space in most countries in which we operate under operating leases that expire at various dates through January 2018. We renew and enter into new leases in the ordinary course of business as required. Short-term Debt Included in short-term debt is ACE INA’s $400 million, 8.2 percent notes which become due on August 15, 2004. We plan to refinance these notes. In June 1999, we arranged certain commercial paper programs. The programs use revolving credit facilities as back-up facilities and provide for up to $2.8 billion in commercial paper issuance (subject to the availability of back-up facilities, which currently total $750 million) for ACE and for ACE INA. During 2003 and 2002, we substantially reduced our use of commercial paper. From time to time, we also use securities repurchase agreements as a source of short-term liquidity. Under these repurchase agreements, we agree to sell securities and repurchase them at a future date for a predetermined price, thereby creating liquidity. The covenants of our existing credit facilities limit our borrowing under repurchase agreements to $800 million. Long-term Debt Our total long-term debt of $1.3 billion is described in Note 8 of our Consolidated Financial Statements. The following instruments have specific collateral triggers. In 1998, ACE US Holdings issued $250 million of unsecured senior notes that mature in October 2008. In December 1999, ACE INA issued $300 million of unsecured subordinated notes that mature in December 2009. We repaid $100 million of this outstanding amount during 2002. We have a $450 million credit default swap in place that has the economic effect of reducing our cost of borrowing associated with these two issuances. The minimum collateral in connection with the credit default swap is $158 million. The actual collateral can be higher depending on the credit quality of securities pledged. Under these transactions, we would be required to provide collateral of $450 million if S&P downgraded our debt rating to BB+ or lower, or downgraded ACE Bermuda’s financial strength rating to BBB- or lower. Although there can be no assurance, we believe it is unlikely that either of these two events will occur. In the event that we terminate either of the swaps prematurely, we would be liable for certain transaction costs. The counter-party in each swap is a highly rated major financial institution and management does not anticipate non-performance. Trust Preferred Securities During 1999 and 2000, we issued $800 million of trust preferred securities of which $400 million matured and was repaid in 2002. The funds generated from these issues were used to partially finance the ACE INA acquisition. The securities outstanding consist of: (i) $400 million company-obligated mandatorily redeemable preferred shares ($100 million and $300 million) issued by two business trusts wholly owned by us; and (ii) $75 million of monthly income preferred securities issued by one of our subsidiary limited liability companies. Each of the three remaining series of trust preferred securities was issued by a special purpose entity that is wholly owned by us; two trusts and a limited liability company. The sole assets of the special purpose entities are debt instruments issued by one or more of our subsidiaries. The special purpose entities look to payments on the debt instruments to make payments on the preferred securities. We have guaranteed the payments on these debt securities. The trustees of the trusts and the managers of the limited liability company include one or more of our officers and at least one independent trustee or manager, such as a bank or trust company. Our officers serving as trustees of the trusts or managers of the limited liability company do not receive any compensation or other remuneration 62 Table of Contents for their services in such capacity. The full $475 million of outstanding trust preferred stock is shown on our consolidated balance sheet as a liability. Additional information with respect to the trust preferred securities is contained in Note 8 of our Consolidated Financial Statements. Credit Facilities The following table shows our credit facilities by credit line, usage, expiry date and purpose at December 31, 2003. Credit Line Usage Expiry Date Purpose Liquidity Facilities ACE Limited 1 $ 500 $ – April 2004 General Corporate ACE Limited 1,2 250 64 May 2005 General Corporate ACE Guaranty Corp 140 – May 2004 General Corporate Secured Operational LOC Facilities ACE Group 500 285 Sept. 2006 General Corporate Unsecured Operational LOC Facilities ACE Limited 500 278 Sept. 2004 General Corporate ACE Limited 100 84 Oct. 2004 General Corporate ACE Global Markets 200 200 Oct. 2004 General Corporate ACE Tempest Re 200 133 Dec. 2004 General Corporate ACE International 21 21 Various General Corporate Unsecured Capital Facilities ACE Guaranty Corp 175 – Dec. 2010 Rating Agency Capital ACE Global Markets 3 679 674 Nov. 2008 Underwriting capacity for Lloyd’s Syndicate 2488-2004 capacity of £550 million (approximately $1 billion) Total $ 3,265 $ 1,739 1 Commercial paper back-up facility 2 May also be used for LOCs 3 Unsecured letters of credit are placed with Lloyd’s as capital on behalf of ACE’s corporate capital vehicles Some of the facilities noted above require that we maintain certain covenants, all of which have been met at December 31, 2003. These covenants include: (i) maintenance of a minimum consolidated net worth covenant of not less than $4.4 billion plus 25 percent of Consolidated Net Income for each fiscal quarter ending on or after March 31, 2003 for which such Consolidated Net Income is positive, plus 50 percent of net proceeds of any issuance of equity interests (other than the net proceeds from any issuance of equity interests in substitution and replacement of other equity interests to the extent such net proceeds do not exceed the amount of a substantially contemporaneous redemption of equity interests) subsequent to March 31, 2003; and (ii) maintenance of a maximum debt to total capitalization ratio of not greater than 0.35 to 1. Under this covenant, debt does not include trust preferred securities or mezzanine equity, except where the ratio of the sum of trust preferred securities and mezzanine equity to total capitalization is greater than 15 percent. In this circumstance, the amount greater than 15 percent would be included in the debt to total capitalization ratio. At December 31, 2003, (a) the minimum consolidated net worth requirement under the covenant described in (i) above was $5.2 billion and our actual consolidated net worth as calculated under that covenant was $8.1 billion; and (b) our ratio of debt to total capitalization was 0.17 to 1. Certain facilities are guaranteed by either operating subsidiaries or ACE Limited. In addition to these covenants, the ACE Global Markets capital facility requires that collateral be posted if the financial strength rating of ACE Limited falls to S&P BBB+ or lower. Prior to November 2003 (the renewal date of the ACE Global Markets unsecured LOC), this requirement related to ACE Bermuda. 63 Table of Contents Our failure to comply with the covenants under any credit facility would, subject to grace periods in the case of certain covenants, result in an event of default. This could require us to repay any outstanding borrowings or to cash collateralize letters of credit under such facility. An event of default under one or more credit facilities with outstanding credit extensions of $25 million or more would result in an event of default under all of the facilities described above. As our Bermuda subsidiaries are not admitted insurers and reinsurers in the U.S., the terms of certain insurance and reinsurance contracts require them to provide LOCs to clients. In addition, ACE Global Markets is required to satisfy certain U.S. regulatory trust fund requirements which can be met by the issuance of LOCs. Recent Accounting Pronouncements See Note 2(p) to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Market Sensitive Instruments and Risk Management Market risk represents the potential for loss due to adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments. We are exposed to potential loss to various market risks, including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. Our investment portfolio consists of both fixed income and equity securities, denominated in both U.S. and foreign currencies, which are sensitive to changes in interest rates, equity prices and foreign currency exchange rates. Therefore our net income is affected by changes in interest rates, equity prices and foreign currency exchange rates. We use investment derivative instruments such as futures, options, interest rate swaps, and foreign currency forward contracts to manage the duration of our investment portfolio and foreign currency exposures and also to obtain exposure to a particular financial market. These instruments are sensitive to changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and equity security prices. The portfolio includes other market sensitive instruments, which are subject to changes in market values with changes in interest rates. Duration Management and Market Exposure Management We use financial futures, options, interest rate swaps and foreign currency forward contracts for the purpose of managing certain investment portfolio exposures. These instruments are recognized as assets or liabilities in our Consolidated Financial Statements and changes in market value are included in net realized gains or losses in the consolidated statements of operations. Our exposure to interest rate risk is concentrated in our fixed income portfolio, and to a lesser extent, our debt obligations. An increase in interest rates of 100 basis points applied instantly across the yield curve would have resulted in a decrease in the market value of our fixed income portfolio of 3.4 percent at December 31, 2003 compared with 3.1 percent at December 31, 2002. This equates to a decrease in market value of approximately $696 million on a fixed income portfolio valued at $20.6 billion at December 31, 2003. This compares with an approximately $488 million decrease in market value on a fixed income portfolio valued at $15.7 billion at December 31, 2002. An immediate time horizon was used as this presents the worst case scenario. Our portfolio of equity securities, which we carry on our balance sheet at fair value, has exposure to price risk. This risk is defined as the potential loss in fair value resulting from adverse changes in stock prices. In addition, we attain exposure to the equity markets through the use of derivative instruments which also have exposure to price risk. Our U.S. equity portfolio is highly correlated with the S&P 500 index and changes in that index would approximate the impact on our portfolio. Our international equity portfolio has exposure to a broad range of non-U.S. equity markets, primarily in those countries where we have insurance operations. This portfolio is correlated to movement in each of these countries’ broad equity market. The combined equity exposure through both our portfolios of equity securities and derivative instruments was valued at $662 million at December 31, 2003 compared with $603 million at December 31, 2002. A hypothetical ten percent decline in the price of each stock in our portfolio of equity securities and the index correlated to the derivative instruments would have resulted in a $66 million decline in fair value at December 31, 2003. This compares to a decline of $60 million at December 31, 2002. Changes in fair value of these derivative instruments are recorded as net realized gains (losses) in the consolidated statements of operations. Changes in the fair value of our equity portfolio are recorded as unrealized appreciation (depreciation) and are included as other comprehensive income in shareholders’ equity. Many of our non-U.S. companies maintain both assets and liabilities in local currencies. Therefore, exchange rate risk is generally limited to net assets denominated in those foreign currencies. Foreign exchange risk is reviewed as part of our risk management 64 Table of Contents process. Locally required capital levels are invested in home currencies in order to satisfy regulatory requirements, and to support local insurance operations regardless of currency fluctuations. Derivatives FAS 133 establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts (collectively referred to as derivatives), and for hedging activities, and requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value. We maintain investments in derivative instruments such as futures, options, interest rate swaps and foreign currency forward contracts for which the primary purposes are to manage duration and foreign currency exposure, yield enhancement or to obtain an exposure to a particular financial market. If certain conditions are met, a derivative may be specifically designated as a fair value cash flow or foreign currency hedge. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative (that is, gains and losses) depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation. Upon application of FAS 133, hedging relationships must be designated and documented pursuant to the provisions of this statement. We had no derivatives that were designated as hedges at December 31, 2003, 2002 or 2001. Certain products (principally credit protection oriented) issued by the Financial Services segment have been determined to meet the definition of a derivative under FAS 133. The “Critical Accounting Estimates” section of the Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition has more information relating to these products.",2023-12-30 19:13:08.329797
896159,CB,Chubb Ltd,2005,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Investments Our principal investment objective is to ensure that funds will be available to meet our primary insurance and reinsurance obligations. Within this broad liquidity constraint, the investment portfolio’s structure seeks to maximize return subject to specifically-approved guidelines of overall asset classes, credit quality, liquidity and volatility of expected 15 Table of Contents returns. As such, our investment portfolio is invested primarily in investment-grade fixed-income securities as measured by the major rating agencies. The management of our investment portfolio is the responsibility of ACE Asset Management. ACE Asset Management operates principally to guide and direct our investment process. In this regard, ACE Asset Management: • conducts formal asset allocation modeling for each of the ACE subsidiaries, providing formal recommendations for the portfolio’s structure; • establishes recommended investment guidelines that are appropriate to the prescribed asset allocation targets; • provides the analysis, evaluation, and selection of our external investment advisors; • establishes and develops investment-related analytics to enhance portfolio engineering and risk control; • monitors and aggregates the correlated risk of the overall investment portfolio; and • provides governance over the investment process for each of our operating companies to ensure consistency of approach and adherence to investment guidelines. For the portfolio, we determine allowable, targeted asset allocation and ranges for each of the operating segments. These asset allocation targets are derived from sophisticated asset and liability modeling that measures correlated histories of returns and volatility of returns. Allowable investment classes are further refined through analysis of our operating environment, including expected volatility of cash flows, overall capital position, regulatory and rating agency considerations. The Finance and Investment Committee of the Board of Directors approves asset allocation targets and reviews our investment policy to ensure that it is consistent with our overall goals, strategies and objectives. Overall investment guidelines are approved by the Finance and Investment Committee to ensure appropriate levels of portfolio liquidity, credit quality, diversification and volatility are maintained. In addition, the Finance and Investment Committee systematically reviews the portfolio’s exposures to capture any potential violations of investment guidelines. Within the guidelines and asset allocation parameters established by the Finance and Investment Committee, individual investment committees of the operating segments determine tactical asset allocation. Additionally, these committees review all investment-related activity that affects their operating company, including the selection of outside investment advisors, proposed asset allocations changes, and the systematic review of investment guidelines. For additional information regarding the investment portfolio, including breakdowns of the sector and maturity distributions, see Note 4 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Regulation Bermuda Operations In Bermuda, our insurance subsidiaries are principally regulated by the Insurance Act 1978 (as amended) and related regulations (the Act). The Act imposes on Bermuda insurance companies, solvency and liquidity standards, as well as auditing and reporting requirements, and grants the Bermuda Monetary Authority (the Authority) powers to supervise, investigate and intervene in the affairs of insurance companies. Significant requirements include the appointment of an independent auditor, the appointment of a loss reserve specialist and the filing of the Annual Statutory Financial Return with the Supervisor of Insurance (the Supervisor). The Supervisor is the chief administrative officer under the Act. The Minister of Finance (the Minister) has appointed an Insurance Advisory Committee which provides advice to the Authority on matters connected with the discharge of its functions under the Act and also may advise the Minister on any matter relating to the development of the insurance industry in Bermuda. We must comply with provisions of the Companies Act 1981 regulating the payment of dividends and distributions. A Bermuda company may not declare or pay a dividend or make a distribution out of contributed surplus if there are reasonable grounds for believing that: (a) the company is, or would after the payment be, unable to pay its liabilities as they become due; or (b) the realizable value of the company’s assets would thereby be less than the aggregate of its liabilities and its issued share capital and share premium accounts. Further, an insurer may not declare or pay any dividends during any financial year if it would cause the insurer to fail to meet its relevant margins, and an insurer which fails to meet its relevant margins on the last day of any financial year may not, without the approval of the Minister, declare or pay any dividends during the next financial year. In addition, some of ACE’s Bermuda subsidiaries qualify as “Class 4” insurers and may not in any financial year pay dividends which would exceed 25 percent of their total statutory capital and surplus, as shown on their statutory balance sheet in relation to the previous financial year, unless they file a solvency affidavit at least seven days in advance. 16 Table of Contents The Supervisor may appoint an inspector with extensive powers to investigate the affairs of an insurer if he believes that an investigation is required in the interest of the insurer’s policyholders or persons who may become policyholders. In order to verify or supplement information otherwise provided to him, the Supervisor may direct an insurer to produce documents or information relating to matters connected with the insurer’s business. The Authority can obtain information from an insurer and from other persons registered under the Act either by requiring the insurer to provide it with such information as it requires with respect to such matters that are likely to be material to the performance of its functions under the Act or by requiring the insurer to provide it with copies of published or unpublished reports pertaining to the insurer and containing such information. The power to obtain information is exercisable in relation to any company in Bermuda which is a parent company, subsidiary company or other associated company of the insurer. The Authority is empowered to obtain documents from an insurer either by serving notice on the insurer to produce to it specified documents or by authorizing an officer, servant or agent to require an insurer to produce the documents to him. If it appears to the Supervisor that there is a risk of the insurer becoming insolvent, or that the insurer is in breach of the Act or any conditions of its registration under the Act, the Supervisor may direct the insurer not to take on any new insurance business, not to vary any insurance contract if the effect would be to increase the insurer’s liabilities, not to make certain investments, to realize certain investments, to maintain in, or transfer to the custody of a specified bank certain assets, not to declare or pay any dividends or other distributions, or to restrict the making of such payments and/or to limit its premium income. The Act requires every insurer to appoint a principal representative resident in Bermuda and to maintain a principal office in Bermuda. The principal representative must be knowledgeable in insurance and is responsible for arranging the maintenance and custody of the statutory accounting records and for filing the annual Statutory Financial Return. There are various obligations placed on the principal representative. Among other items, the principal representative must report to the Authority upon reaching the view that there is any likelihood of the insurer becoming insolvent or when the principal representative becomes aware or has reason to believe that the insurer has failed or defaulted in matters that may have been set out in the Act. The Act makes no attempt to restrict the nature of the risks underwritten by an insurer though conditions may be imposed relating to certain types of insurance business at the time of the application to register under the Act. U.S. Operations Although at the present time there is limited federal regulation of the insurance business in the U.S., our U.S. insurance subsidiaries are subject to extensive regulation in the states in which they do business. The laws of the various states establish supervisory agencies with broad authority to regulate, among other things: licenses to transact business, soliciting business, advertising, rates for certain business, policy language, underwriting and claims practices, transactions with affiliates, reserve adequacy, dividends, investments and insurer solvency. In addition, the U.S. insurance subsidiaries are subject to judicial decisions that define the scope of an insurer’s duty to defend a claim and the risks and benefits for which insurance is sought and provided. These include judicial interpretations of the nature of the insured risk in such areas as product liability and environmental coverages. Regulations generally require insurance and reinsurance companies to furnish information to their domestic state insurance department concerning activities which may materially affect the operations, management or financial condition and solvency of the company. Regulations vary from state to state but generally require that each primary insurance company obtain a license from the department of insurance of a state to conduct business in that state. A reinsurance company is not generally required to have an insurance license to reinsure a U.S. ceding company. However, for a U.S. ceding company to obtain financial statement credit for reinsurance ceded, the reinsurer must obtain an insurance license or accredited status from the cedant’s state of domicile or must post collateral to support the liabilities ceded. In addition, regulations for reinsurers vary somewhat from primary insurers in that reinsurers are typically not subject to regulator approval of insurance policy forms or the rates agreed to between ceding insurers and their reinsurers. Our U.S. insurance subsidiaries are required to file detailed annual and, in some states, quarterly reports with state insurance regulators in each of the states in which they do business. Such annual and quarterly reports are required to be prepared on a calendar year basis. In addition, the U.S. insurance subsidiaries’ operations and accounts are subject to examination at regular intervals by state regulators. The respective reports filed in accordance with applicable insurance regulations with respect to the most recent periodic examinations of the U.S. insurance subsidiaries contained no material adverse findings. 17 Table of Contents Statutory surplus is an important measure utilized by the regulators and rating agencies to assess our U.S. insurance subsidiaries’ ability to support business operations and provide dividend capacity. Our U.S. insurance subsidiaries are subject to various state statutory and regulatory restrictions that limit the amount of dividends that may be paid without prior approval from regulatory authorities. These restrictions differ by state, but are generally based on calculations incorporating statutory surplus, statutory net income, and/or investment income. State insurance statutes also impose Risk Based Capital (RBC) requirements that are applicable to some of the U.S. insurance subsidiaries. These RBC requirements are designed to monitor capital adequacy and to raise the level of protection that statutory surplus provides for policyholders. The RBC formula provides a mechanism for the calculation of an insurance company’s Authorized Control Level (ACL) RBC amount. The initial RBC level which triggers regulatory action is known as the Company Action Level. Failure to achieve this level of RBC, which occurs if policyholders’ surplus falls below 200 percent of the ACL, requires the insurance company to submit a plan of corrective action to the relevant insurance commissioner. Based on the RBC formula, at December 31, 2004, the policyholders’ surplus of each of the active U.S. insurance subsidiaries was higher than the Company Action Level. There are additional progressive RBC failure levels, which trigger more stringent regulatory action. If an insurer’s policyholders’ surplus falls below the Mandatory Control Level (70 percent of the ACL), the relevant insurance commissioner is required to place the insurer under regulatory control. However, an insurance commissioner may allow a P&C company operating below the Mandatory Control Level that is writing no business and is running off its existing business to continue its run-off. Brandywine is running-off its liabilities consistent with the terms of an order issued by the Insurance Commissioner of Pennsylvania. This includes periodic reporting obligations to the Pennsylvania Insurance Department. The Commissioner has determined that Brandywine has sufficient assets to meet its obligations. In November 2002, the U.S. Congress passed the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (TRIA), which requires commercial P&C insurers to offer coverage for losses due to certified acts of terrorism that does not differ materially from the terms, amounts and other coverage limitations offered by the insurer for other types of risks. Insured losses which are compensable under TRIA are those losses caused by an act certified by the Secretary of the Treasury, in concurrence with the Secretary of State and the Attorney General, to be an act of terrorism. The Secretary may only certify an act as terrorism if it involves a foreign person or group and has resulted in damage within the United States or to a U.S. air carrier or U.S. flag vessel. To be certified, the act must have caused aggregate damages exceeding $5 million. TRIA nullifies all terrorism exclusions in existing commercial P&C policies, but such exclusions may be reinstated if the insured either gives written authorization for such reinstatement or fails to pay any increased premium for the terrorism coverage after 30 days’ notice. TRIA also provides for the federal government to reimburse insurers for 90 percent of their terrorism-related losses, subject to a premium-based deductible. The deductible for 2004 was ten percent of direct earned premiums for the year. For 2005, the deductible is 15 percent of direct earned premium. Unless renewed by the U.S. Congress, TRIA is scheduled to expire on December 31, 2005. Expiration of TRIA may lead ACE to reduce its writings to terror exposed risks or to take other measures to mitigate its exposure to the potential for catastrophic terror loss. Our U.S. subsidiaries are also subject to the general laws of the states in which they do business. The Attorneys General of several states have issued subpoenas or other forms of requests for information regarding the underwriting and agent compensation policies of several U.S. insurance subsidiaries. These investigations are primarily aimed at determining the compliance of these companies with the antitrust laws of the states which issued the subpoenas. International Operations The extent of insurance regulation varies significantly among the countries in which the non-U.S. ACE operations conduct business. While each country imposes licensing, solvency, auditing and financial reporting requirements, the type and extent of the requirements differ substantially. For example: • in some countries, insurers are required to prepare and file quarterly financial reports, and in others, only annual reports; • some regulators require intermediaries to be involved in the sale of insurance products, whereas other regulators permit direct sales contact between the insurer and the customer; • the extent of restrictions imposed upon an insurer’s use of foreign reinsurance vary; • policy form filing and rate regulation also vary by country; • the frequency of contact and periodic on-site examinations by insurance authorities differ by country; and • regulatory requirements relating to insurer’s dividend policies vary by country. 18 Table of Contents Significant variations can also be found in the size, structure and resources of the local regulatory departments that oversee insurance activities. Certain regulators prefer close relationships with all subject insurers and others operate a risk-based approach. ACE operates in some countries through our subsidiaries and in some countries through branches of those subsidiaries. Local capital requirements applicable to a subsidiary generally include its branches. Certain ACE companies are jointly owned with local companies to comply with legal requirements for local ownership. Other legal requirements include discretionary licensing procedures, compulsory cessions of reinsurance, local retention of funds and records, and foreign exchange controls. ACE’s international companies are also subject to multinational application of certain U.S. laws. The complex regulatory environments in which ACE operates are subject to change and are regularly monitored. Europe AEGL and ACE Underwriting Agencies Limited (responsible for managing Syndicate 2488 at Lloyd’s) and staff employed within the U.K. operations, are subject to primary regulation by the Financial Services Authority (FSA-U.K.). The FSA-U.K. is the single U.K. statutory regulator for the supervision of securities, banking and insurance business. The FSA-U.K. imposes capital adequacy, auditing, financial reporting and other requirements upon both insurers and the Society of Lloyd’s. In addition, Syndicate 2488 is subject to the requirements of the Council of Lloyd’s. The FSA-U.K. regulates us and our subsidiaries in the ownership chain of our U.K. insurance companies, Lloyd’s managing agencies and Corporate Capital Vehicles (CCVs) pursuant to their authority with respect to a “controller”. Certain U.K.-based directors and employees are individually subject to regulation by the FSA-U.K. and Lloyd’s. AEGL was re-authorized by the FSA-U.K. to write all classes of general insurance business in December 2002. From January 1, 2003, AEGL has been underwriting business in the UK, and has established branches in 13 European Economic Area (EEA) states as well as Switzerland, a non-EEA country. It is able to conduct cross border business throughout continental Europe on a freedom of services basis in 27 EEA states, including 10 new European member states added to the European Union on May 1, 2004. AEGL also has permissions to operate in Jersey, Guernsey and Gibraltar. AEGL is subject to group solvency requirements set by the European directive on Supervision of Insurance Undertakings in Insurance Groups. AEGL has been listed on the NAIC quarterly listing of alien E&S insurers since October 1, 2004, and now holds E&S eligibilities in 40 U.S. states. AEGL is also able to underwrite risks and issue reinsurance policies to insurance companies throughout most of the world’s markets on a non-admitted basis. All ACE Europe branded P&C and A&H business was underwritten through ACE Insurance S.A.-N.V. until December 31, 2004. On January 1, 2005, ACE Insurance S.A. – N.V. transferred its assets, liabilities and obligations to AEGL, with regulatory responsibility transferring to FSA-U.K. ACE Insurance S.A.-N.V was registered as an insurer in Belgium and regulated by the CBFA (the Commission bancaire, financière et des assurances/Commissie voor het Bank-, Financie- en Assurantiewezen and formerly known as the OCA). With effect from January 1, 2005, ACE Insurance S.A.-N.V. surrendered its insurance licenses and all ACE Europe branded business is now written through AEGL. The FSA-U.K. has taken over the regulation of managing agents that were previously subject to Lloyd’s supervision. Lloyd’s Regulatory Department is now responsible for managing risk on behalf of the Lloyd’s Franchise and a new department, the Franchise Directorate, has been set up to approve and monitor each syndicate’s business plan. ACE Far East ACE Japan is regulated by the Financial Services Authority in Japan (FSA-Japan). In accordance with the Insurance Business Law in Japan, the FSA-Japan focuses on protecting policyholders’ interests by ensuring the sound management of insurance companies and their operations, including licensing, product filings and approval, distribution of insurance products, investment of insurance premiums and other assets, etc. FSA-Japan staff conduct on-site inspections when deemed necessary. Insurance companies must submit an annual business report regarding its operations and assets. Deregulation and liberalization of the Japanese non-life insurance market has placed more emphasis on insurers’ independence of operation and compliance requirements. United States Regulation and Tax of Non-U.S. Operations Regulation of non-U.S insurers, often referred to as alien insurers, varies on a state by state basis. However, generally, alien insurers may write primary insurance in a state in one of three ways: (1) pursuant to a license issued by a state (admitted insurers), (2) by meeting a state’s E&S lines eligibility standards (surplus lines-eligible insurers) or (3) pursuant to other 19 Table of Contents state-specific exemptions. Alien insurers may write reinsurance on either an admitted or non-admitted basis. Admitted alien insurers are subject to regulation of solvency, premium rates and policy forms similar to regulation of domestic insurers. Surplus lines-eligible and other non-admitted alien insurers may be subject to minimum solvency and security requirements and other state specific criteria. Lloyd’s is licensed for direct insurance in Illinois, Kentucky and the U.S. Virgin Islands and is an eligible E&S lines insurer in all states and territories except Kentucky and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Lloyd’s is also an accredited reinsurer in all states and territories. In certain states, various categories of direct insurance are exempt under state laws. Lloyd’s maintains various trust funds in the state of New York in support of past, current and future underwriting of U.S. business, subject to regulation by the New York Insurance Department, which acts as the domiciliary commissioner for Lloyd’s U.S. trust funds. There are also deposit trust funds in other states to support both reinsurance and E&S lines insurance business. In addition AEGL, is an eligible E&S lines insurer in 40 U.S. states, with a number of additional state applications pending. AEGL is also able to write reinsurance business on a non-admitted basis in both the U.S. and a number of other jurisdictions. Each state in the U.S. licenses insurers and prohibits, with some exceptions, the sale of insurance by non-admitted, non-U.S. insurers within its jurisdictions. ACE and its non-U.S. insurance subsidiaries, excluding its Lloyd’s operations, are not licensed to do business as admitted insurers in any jurisdiction in the U.S. Many states impose a premium tax (typically two percent to four percent of gross premiums written) on insureds who obtain insurance from non-admitted foreign insurers, such as ACE Bermuda. The premiums charged by the non-U.S. insurer do not include any U.S. state premium tax. Each insured is responsible for determining whether it is subject to any such tax and for paying such tax as may be due. The U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, (the Code) also imposes an excise tax on insurance and reinsurance premiums paid to foreign insurers or reinsurers with respect to U.S. risks. The rates of tax, unless reduced by an applicable U.S. tax treaty, are four percent for non-life insurance premiums and one percent for life insurance and all reinsurance premiums. There can be no assurance that new or additional legislation in the U.S. will not be proposed and enacted that has the effect of subjecting our non-U.S. insurance subsidiaries, including our Lloyd’s operations, to regulation in the U.S. Tax Matters Corporate Income Tax ACE Limited is a Cayman Islands corporation that operates as a holding company with offices only in Bermuda and does not pay U.S. corporate income taxes (except certain withholding taxes) on the basis that it is not engaged in a trade or business in the U.S. However, there can be no assurance that the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) will not contend to the contrary. If ACE Limited were subject to U.S. income tax, there could be a material adverse effect on our shareholders’ equity and earnings. ACE Limited and its Bermuda-based insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries do not file U.S. income tax returns reporting income subject to U.S. income tax since they do not conduct business within the U.S. However, ACE Limited and its Bermuda-based insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries have filed protective tax returns reporting no U.S. income to preserve their ability to deduct their ordinary and necessary business expenses should the IRS successfully challenge their contention that none of their income is subject to a net income tax in the U.S. Under current Cayman Islands law, ACE Limited is not required to pay any taxes on its income or capital gains. ACE Limited has received an undertaking that, in the event of any taxes being imposed, ACE Limited will be exempted from taxation in the Cayman Islands until the year 2013. Under current Bermuda law, ACE Limited and its Bermuda subsidiaries are not required to pay any taxes on its income or capital gains. ACE Limited and the Bermuda subsidiaries have received an undertaking from the Minister of Finance in Bermuda that, in the event of any taxes being imposed, ACE Limited will be exempt from taxation in Bermuda until March 2016. Income from the operations at Lloyd’s is subject to U.K. corporation taxes. Lloyd’s is also required to pay U.S. income tax on U.S. effectively connected income written by Lloyd’s syndicates. Lloyd’s has a closing agreement with the IRS whereby the amount of tax due on this business is calculated by Lloyd’s and remitted directly to the IRS. These amounts are then charged to the accounts of the Names/Corporate Members in proportion to their participation in the relevant 20 Table of Contents syndicates. Our Corporate Members are subject to this arrangement but, as U.K. domiciled companies, will receive U.K. corporation tax credits for any U.S. income tax incurred up to the amount of the equivalent U.K. corporation income tax charge on the U.S. income. ACE Prime Holdings and ACE Capital Re USA Holdings (through April 28, 2004) and their respective subsidiaries are subject, directly or, as shareholders, indirectly to U.S. corporate income tax and file U.S. tax returns. Certain of our international operations are also subject to income taxes imposed by the jurisdictions in which they operate. Related Person Insurance Income Each U.S. person, who beneficially owns our Ordinary Shares (directly or through foreign entities) on the last day of a non-U.S. insurance subsidiary’s fiscal year, will have to include in such person’s gross income for U.S. income tax purposes a proportionate share (determined as described herein) of the related person insurance income (RPII) of such insurance subsidiary, unless the RPII of such insurance subsidiary, determined on a gross basis, is “de minimis” (i.e., less than 20 percent of that insurance subsidiary’s gross insurance income in such fiscal year). RPII is income attributable to insurance policies where the direct or indirect insureds are U.S. shareholders, or are related to U.S. shareholder, of ACE, and is includible in a U.S. shareholder’s gross income for U.S. tax purposes regardless of whether or not such shareholder is an insured. For the calendar year ended December 31, 2004, we believe the de minimis exception will apply. Although no assurances can be given, we anticipate that gross RPII of each of our non-U.S. insurance subsidiaries will fall within the de minimis exception and we will endeavor to take such steps as we determine to be reasonable to cause its gross RPII to remain below such level. The RPII provisions of the Code have never been interpreted by the courts. Regulations interpreting the RPII provisions of the Code exist only in proposed form, having been proposed on April 16, 1991. It is not certain whether these regulations will be adopted in their proposed form or what changes or clarifications might ultimately be made thereto or whether any such changes, as well as any interpretation or application of RPII by the IRS, the courts, or otherwise, might have retroactive effect. ITEM 2. Properties We operate in over 50 countries around the world including the U.S., Bermuda, the U.K., and Japan. Most of the office facilities that we occupy are leased. We are not dependent on our facilities to conduct business. ITEM 3. Legal Proceedings Claims Litigation Our insurance subsidiaries are subject to claims litigation involving disputed interpretations of policy coverages and, in some jurisdictions, direct actions by allegedly-injured persons seeking damages from policyholders. These lawsuits, involving claims on policies issued by our subsidiaries which are typical to the insurance industry in general and in the normal course of business, are considered in our loss and loss expense reserves which are discussed in the P&C loss reserves discussion. In addition to claims litigation, we and our subsidiaries are subject to lawsuits and regulatory actions in the normal course of business that do not arise from or directly relate to claims on insurance policies. This category of business litigation typically involves, inter alia, allegations of underwriting errors or misconduct, employment claims, regulatory activity or disputes arising from our business ventures. Subpoenas ACE, its subsidiaries and affiliates have received forty-three subpoenas, interrogatories, civil investigative demands, and letters of inquiry in connection with the pending investigations of insurance industry practices. These inquiries have been issued by Attorneys General of Connecticut, the District of Columbia, Florida, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas, and West Virginia and Departments of Insurance or other regulatory authorities in California, Florida, Illinois, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Texas. On October 14, 2004, the NYAG filed a civil suit against Marsh & McLennan Companies Inc. (Marsh), alleging that certain Marsh business practices were fraudulent and violated antitrust and securities laws. ACE was not named as a defendant in the suit, although ACE was named as one of four insurance companies whose employees participated in the practices in question. There can be no assurance that ACE will not be named in future actions brought by the NYAG or any 21 Table of Contents other state attorneys general. In addition, an underwriter, who is no longer employed by ACE, in an ACE insurance subsidiary has pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor based on these practices. ACE is cooperating and will continue to cooperate with the AG Investigations. ACE has also received subpoenas from the office of the NYAG and the SEC which seek information relating to non-traditional or loss mitigation insurance products. ACE is cooperating and will continue to cooperate with the NYAG and the SEC. ACE is conducting its own internal investigation that encompasses the subjects raised by the NYAG, the other state attorneys general and the SEC. It is being conducted by a team from the firm of Debevoise & Plimpton LLP. The team is headed by former United States Attorney Mary Jo White and operates under the direction of the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors has retained Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton, special outside counsel, to advise it in connection with these matters. We have terminated two employees, one of which has pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor, and have suspended three other employees as a result of our internal investigation. Other Litigation In January 2005, the Connecticut Attorney General (the “CTAG”) filed a civil suit against a subsidiary of ACE in Connecticut state court under the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act. The CTAG’s suit alleges that an ACE subsidiary made an unauthorized and undisclosed payment to a broker who placed a portfolio of state workers’ compensation cases with ACE and seeks restitution to the state and payment of punitive damages. ACE believes that it has not violated any law or duty to the state and intends to file a motion to dismiss the action. ACE, ACE INA Holdings, Inc. and ACE USA have been named in the following ten federal putative nationwide class actions brought by insurance policyholders. Bayou Steel Corporation v. ACE INA Holdings, et al. (Case No. 04 CV 5391 E.D. Pa) (filed November 18, 2004); Eagle Creek, Inc. v. ACE INA Holdings, et al. (Case No. 04 CV 5255; E.D. Pa.) (filed November 10, 2004); Stephen Lewis vs. Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc., et al. (Case No. 04 CV 7847; N.D. Ill.) (filed December 6, 2004); Opticare Health Systems, Inc. v. Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc., et al. (Case No. 04 CV 06954; S.D.N.Y.) (filed October 19, 2004); Diane Preuss v. March & McLennan Companies, et al. (Case No. 04 CV 78553; N.D. Ill.) (filed December 6, 2004); Redwood Oil Company v. Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc. (Case No. 05 C 0390; N.D. Ill.) (filed January 21, 2005); Shell Vacations LLC v. Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc., et al. (Case No. 05 C 0270; N.D. Ill.) (filed January 14, 2005); Edward Macuish v. Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc., et al. (Case No. 2005 CV 00440; N.D. Ill.) (filed January 25, 2005); David Boros v. Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc., et al. (Case No. C050543EDL; N.D. Calf.) (filed February 4, 2005), and Robert Mulcahy v. Arthur J. Gallagher & Co., et al. (Case No. 2005 CV 01064; D. N.J.) (filed February 23, 2005). In each of these cases, the plaintiff has sued a number of other insurance entities in addition to the ACE entities. The Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation (JPML) consolidated these cases, as well as other putative class actions in which no ACE entity is named as a party in the District of New Jersey. In each of the actions in which they have been served, the obligation of the ACE entities to answer the complaints has been, or will be, stayed until after a consolidated complaint has been filed. In each of these cases, the plaintiff alleges that insurers, including certain ACE entities, and brokers conspired to increase premiums and allocate customers through the use of “B” quotes and contingent commissions. Although the causes of action in the petitions somewhat vary, Plaintiffs allege causes of action under the Federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organization Act (RICO), federal antitrust law, state antitrust law, state consumer-protection laws, and state common law (breach of fiduciary duty and misrepresentation). In each of the cases, the plaintiff has sought unspecified compensatory damages and reimbursement of expenses, including legal fees. ACE USA and ACE INA have been named in a state court class action: Palm Tree Computer Systems, Inc. et al. v. ACE USA et al. (Case No. 05-CA-373-16-W; Circuit Court, Seminole County, Florida) (filed February 5, 2005). The allegations are similar to the allegations in the federal class actions identified above. Plaintiffs allege causes of action under every state’s consumer statute and state common law (breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment). The complaint states that “neither the Plaintiff nor any member of the Class has suffered damages exceeding $74,999.00 each, even when trebled. In no event will Plaintiff or any member of the Class accept damages in excess of $74,999.00 for each class member.” Illinois Union Insurance Company, an ACE subsidiary, has been named in a state court class action: Van Emden Management Corporation v. Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc., et al. (Case No. 05-0066A; Superior Court of Massachusetts) (filed January 13, 2005). The allegations are similar to the allegations in the federal class actions identified above. Plaintiffs assert causes of action under Massachusetts’ antitrust statute and Massachusetts’ consumer protection statute. Plaintiffs also assert a conspiracy cause of action and seek an injunction. Plaintiff has sought unspecified compensatory damages and reimbursement of expenses, including legal fees. 22 Table of Contents ACE has been named in the following four putative securities class action suits: John Mahaney, Jr. v. ACE Limited, et al. (Case No. 04 CV 07696; S.D.N.Y) (filed October 18, 2004); Steven Burda v. ACE Limited, et al.; (Case No. 04 CV 833; S.D.N.Y.) (filed October 21, 2004); Thomas E. Barton v. ACE Limited, et al.; (Case No. 04 CV 8683; S.D.N.Y.) (filed November 1, 2004); and Friends of Ariel Center for Policy Research v. ACE Limited, et al. (Case No. 04 CV 04907; E.D. Pa.) (filed October 19, 2004). Evan G. Greenberg, ACE’s President and Chief Executive Officer, Brian Duperreault, ACE’s Chairman and former Chief Executive Officer, and Philip V. Bancroft, ACE’s Chief Financial Officer were also named as defendants in each of these suits. In addition, Dominic J. Frederico, ACE’s former Vice Chairman and former President and Chief Operating Officer, and Christopher Z. Marshall, ACE’s former Chief Financial Officer, were named as defendants in the Burda action. On January 3, 2005, the Burda and Barton actions were consolidated for all purposes into the Mahaney action. In December 2004, the defendants filed a motion with the JPML seeking consolidation of the cases for pretrial purposes in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. That motion is currently pending, and no plaintiffs have yet filed a brief stating a position on consolidation and transfer. The plaintiffs in these cases assert claims solely under Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”), Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, and Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act (control person liability). The plaintiffs allege that ACE’s public statements and securities filings should have revealed that insurers, including certain ACE entities, and brokers conspired to increase premiums and allocate customers through the use of “B” quotes and contingent commissions and that ACE’s revenue and earnings were inflated by premiums which it may have to forfeit by fines or judgments. ACE understands that it has been named as a defendant in a derivative suit filed in Delaware Chancery Court by shareholders of Marsh. The derivative suit seeks to recover damages for Marsh and its subsidiary, Marsh, Inc., against officers and directors of Marsh, American International Group Inc. (AIG), AIG’s chief executive officer, and ACE. The suit alleges that the defendants damaged Marsh and Marsh, Inc. by participating in a bid rigging scheme and obtaining “kickbacks” in the form of contingent commissions. The suit alleges that ACE knowingly participated in the officers’ and directors’ breaches of fiduciary duty to Marsh, Inc. and Marsh. The plaintiff has sought unspecified compensatory damages and reimbursement of expenses, including legal fees. ACE has not been served in this action, though no assurance can be given that it will not be served. On December 6, 2004, Goss International Corporation filed a “Verified Petition for Discovery” in Illinois state court naming several respondents, including ACE, Illinois Union Insurance Co., a subsidiary of ACE, five other insurance companies, Marsh and Marsh Inc. This petition was filed under an Illinois Supreme Court rule which purports to allow a person to engage in discovery for the sole purpose of identifying one who may be responsible in damages in anticipation of filing a complaint. Goss claims that it has used Marsh as its broker, and that Marsh presented quotes to Goss from each of the insurance company respondents. ACE has not been served in this action, though no assurance can be given that it will not be served. Goss and the other defendants, including Illinois Union Insurance Co., have negotiated an agreed briefing schedule pertaining to Goss’s request for pre-suit discovery. If it is served, ACE intends to vigorously oppose the request for pre-suit discovery. All of these suits merely seek compensatory damages without specifying an amount. As a result, ACE cannot at this time estimate its potential costs related to these legal matters and accordingly no liability for compensatory damages has been established in the Consolidated Financial Statements. However, we have recorded expenses for legal fees of $11.5 million in connection with these matters. In the opinion of ACE’s management, ACE’s ultimate liability for these matters is not likely to have a material adverse effect on ACE’s consolidated financial condition, although it is possible that the effect could be material to ACE’s consolidated results of operations for an individual reporting period. In 1999 and 2000, AICCO, Inc., a subsidiary of AIG, Granite State Insurance Company, a subsidiary of AIG, and Northwestern Pacific Indemnity Company, a subsidiary of The Chubb Corporation filed suit against certain subsidiaries of ACE contending that the 1996 restructuring of INA had violated the California unfair competition law and seeking declaratory and injunctive relief on the issue of whether, under the 1996 Brandywine restructuring, INA was permitted to transfer all of its A&E liabilities to Century Indemnity without obtaining the consent of affected California policyholders. The plaintiffs in the case, competitors of ACE, did not allege that they suffered any harm as a result of the 1996 restructuring but rather brought suit under a California “private attorney general” statute that allowed any person to bring a claim under the California unfair competition law acting for the interest of the general public. In November 2004, California voters passed Proposition 64 which, among other things, amended the California unfair competition law so as to allow actions to be prosecuted only by persons who were actually injured by, and suffered loss because of, the allegedly unfair business practice. On March 4, 2005, the court granted summary judgment to the ACE parties and dismissed the lawsuit based upon the passage of Proposition 64. There can be no assurance as to whether the plaintiffs will appeal the dismissal of their case or whether any such dismissal would be successful. 23 Table of Contents ITEM 4.

ITEM 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following is a discussion of our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity and capital resources as of and for the year ended December 31, 2004. This discussion should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes presented on pages F-1 to F-68 of this Form 10-K. Overview ACE Limited (ACE) is the Bermuda-based holding company of the ACE Group of Companies, incorporated with limited liability under the Cayman Islands Companies Law. We created our business office in Bermuda in 1985 when we initially incorporated the Company and we continue to maintain our corporate headquarters in Bermuda. Through our various operating subsidiaries, we provide a broad range of insurance and reinsurance products to businesses and individuals worldwide through operations in the U.S. and more than 50 other countries. Our long-term business strategy focuses on sustained growth in book value achieved through a combination of underwriting and investment income. By doing so, we provide value to our clients and shareholders through the utilization of our substantial capital base in the insurance and reinsurance markets. As an insurance and reinsurance company, we generate gross revenues from two principal sources, premiums which are usually paid in advance of loss payments, and dividends and interest income earned on invested assets. Cash flow is generated from premiums collected and investment income received less paid losses and loss expenses. Generally, when an insurance company writing long-tail business grows, as ACE has over the last two years, its cash flows tend to be positive. ACE generated approximately $5 billion in positive operating cash flow in 2004 while invested assets over this period also increased by $5 billion. Invested assets are generally held in liquid, investment grade fixed income securities of relatively short duration. We also invest a small portion of our assets in less liquid or higher risk assets in an attempt to achieve higher risk-adjusted returns. Claims payments in any short-term period are highly unpredictable due to the random nature of loss events and the timing of claims awards or settlements. The value of investments held to pay future claims is subject to market forces such as the level of interest rates, stock market volatility and credit events such as corporate defaults. The actual cost of claims is also volatile based on loss trends, inflation rates, court awards and catastrophes. We believe that our cash balances, our highly liquid investments, credit facilities and reinsurance protection provide sufficient liquidity to meet any unforeseen claim demands that might occur in the year ahead. The insurance industry is highly competitive with many companies offering similar coverage. Until recently, the insurance market had been characterized by sharply rising rates on new and renewal business, combined with restrictive terms and conditions. In 2004, we observed rate reductions across several classes and although we have continued to report growth in net premiums written, the rate of growth declined in 2004, compared with 2003 and 2002. This is a reflection of our underwriting discipline in the face of a weakening market, partially offset by our increased market and product presence both in the U.S. and throughout the world. We believe the market overall remains stable and rates, terms and conditions overall are reasonable despite the downward pressure on rates which has continued into the first quarter of 2005. 2004 was a record year for property catastrophe losses for the insurance industry. We incurred net losses of $499 million in 2004, primarily relating to hurricanes which struck the Caribbean and the U.S. and, to a lesser extent, typhoons which impacted Asia. The tsunami disaster had no material impact on our operating results and financial condition. During the fourth quarter of 2004, we increased our reserve for asbestos, environmental and other run-off claims by $465 million, which resulted in an after-tax charge to net income of $302 million. The net additions comprised asbestos and environmental (A&E) reserve increases of $554 million including the provision for bad debts of $95 million and favorable prior period development of $89 million in other run-off reserves. For more information, refer to the section entitled “Asbestos and Environmental and Other Run-off Liabilities”. We are closely following developments on possible legislation to move all U.S. asbestos bodily injury claims to a federal trust for compensation in accordance with an established set of medical criteria 28 Table of Contents and claim values. The trust would be funded by asbestos defendants and their insurers. As currently proposed, ACE would be one of the insurer participants. However, we cannot predict if any such proposed legislation will be modified or adopted. Insurance Industry Investigations and Related Matters ACE, its subsidiaries and affiliates have received forty-three subpoenas, interrogatories, civil investigative demands, and letters of inquiry in connection with the pending investigations of insurance industry practices. These inquiries have been issued by Attorneys General of Connecticut, the District of Columbia, Florida, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas, and West Virginia and Departments of Insurance or other regulatory authorities in California, Florida, Illinois, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Texas. On October 14, 2004, the NYAG filed a civil suit against Marsh & McLennan Companies Inc. (Marsh), alleging that certain Marsh business practices were fraudulent and violated antitrust and securities laws. ACE was not named as a defendant in the suit, although ACE was named as one of four insurance companies whose employees participated in the practices in question. There can be no assurance that ACE will not be named in future actions brought by the NYAG or any other state attorneys general. In addition, an underwriter, who is no longer employed by ACE, in an ACE insurance subsidiary has pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor based on these practices. ACE is cooperating and will continue to cooperate with the AG Investigations. ACE has also received subpoenas from the office of the NYAG and the SEC which seek information relating to non-traditional or loss mitigation insurance products. ACE is cooperating and will continue to cooperate with the NYAG and the SEC. ACE is conducting its own internal investigation that encompasses the subjects raised by the NYAG, the other state attorneys general and the SEC. It is being conducted by a team from the firm of Debevoise & Plimpton LLP. The team is headed by former United States Attorney Mary Jo White and operates under the direction of the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors has retained Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton, special outside counsel, to advise it in connection with these matters. We have terminated two employees, one of which has pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor, and have suspended three other employees as a result of our internal investigation. In January 2005, the Connecticut Attorney General (the “CTAG”) filed a civil suit against a subsidiary of ACE in Connecticut state court under the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act. The CTAG’s suit alleges that an ACE subsidiary made an unauthorized and undisclosed payment to a broker who placed a portfolio of state workers’ compensation cases with ACE and seeks restitution to the state and payment of punitive damages. ACE believes that it has not violated any law or duty to the state and intends to file a motion to dismiss the action. ACE, ACE INA Holdings, Inc. and ACE USA have been named in the following ten federal putative nationwide class actions brought by insurance policyholders. Bayou Steel Corporation v. ACE INA Holdings, et al. (Case No. 04 CV 5391 E.D. Pa) (filed November 18, 2004); Eagle Creek, Inc. v. ACE INA Holdings, et al. (Case No. 04 CV 5255; E.D. Pa.) (filed November 10, 2004); Stephen Lewis vs. Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc., et al. (Case No. 04 CV 7847; N.D. Ill.) (filed December 6, 2004); Opticare Health Systems, Inc. v. Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc., et al. (Case No. 04 CV 06954; S.D.N.Y.) (filed October 19, 2004); Diane Preuss v. March & McLennan Companies, et al. (Case No. 04 CV 78553; N.D. Ill.) (filed December 6, 2004); Redwood Oil Company v. Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc. (Case No. 05 C 0390; N.D. Ill.) (filed January 21, 2005); Shell Vacations LLC v. Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc., et al. (Case No. 05 C 0270; N.D. Ill.) (filed January 14, 2005); Edward Macuish v. Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc., et al. (Case No. 2005 CV 00440; N.D. Ill.) (filed January 25, 2005); David Boros v. Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc., et al. (Case No. C050543EDL; N.D. Calf.) (filed February 4, 2005), and Robert Mulcahy v. Arthur J. Gallagher & Co., et al. (Case No. 2005 CV 01064; D. N.J.) (filed February 23, 2005). In each of these cases, the plaintiff has sued a number of other insurance entities in addition to the ACE entities. The Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation (JPML) consolidated these cases, as well as other putative class actions in which no ACE entity is named as a party in the District of New Jersey. In each of the actions in which they have been served, the obligation of the ACE entities to answer the complaints has been, or will be, stayed until after a consolidated complaint has been filed. In each of these cases, the plaintiff alleges that insurers, including certain ACE entities, and brokers conspired to increase premiums and allocate customers through the use of “B” quotes and contingent commissions. Although the causes of action in the petitions somewhat vary, Plaintiffs allege causes of action under the Federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organization Act (RICO), federal antitrust law, state antitrust law, state consumer-protection laws, and state common law (breach of fiduciary duty and misrepresentation). In each of the cases, the plaintiff has sought unspecified compensatory damages and reimbursement of expenses, including legal fees. ACE USA and ACE INA have been named in a state court class action: Palm Tree Computer Systems, Inc. et al. v. ACE USA et al. (Case No. 05-CA-373-16-W; Circuit Court, Seminole County, Florida) (filed February 5, 2005). The allegations are similar 29 Table of Contents to the allegations in the federal class actions identified above. Plaintiffs allege causes of action under every state’s consumer statute and state common law (breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment). The complaint states that “neither the Plaintiff nor any member of the Class has suffered damages exceeding $74,999.00 each, even when trebled. In no event will Plaintiff or any member of the Class accept damages in excess of $74,999.00 for each class member.” Illinois Union Insurance Company, an ACE subsidiary, has been named in a state court class action: Van Emden Management Corporation v. Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc., et al. (Case No. 05-0066A; Superior Court of Massachusetts) (filed January 13, 2005). The allegations are similar to the allegations in the federal class actions identified above. Plaintiffs assert causes of action under Massachusetts’ antitrust statute and Massachusetts’ consumer protection statute. Plaintiffs also assert a conspiracy cause of action and seek an injunction. Plaintiff has sought unspecified compensatory damages and reimbursement of expenses, including legal fees. ACE has been named in the following four putative securities class action suits: John Mahaney, Jr. v. ACE Limited, et al. (Case No. 04 CV 07696; S.D.N.Y) (filed October 18, 2004); Steven Burda v. ACE Limited, et al.; (Case No. 04 CV 833; S.D.N.Y.) (filed October 21, 2004); Thomas E. Barton v. ACE Limited, et al.; (Case No. 04 CV 8683; S.D.N.Y.) (filed November 1, 2004); and Friends of Ariel Center for Policy Research v. ACE Limited, et al. (Case No. 04 CV 04907; E.D. Pa.) (filed October 19, 2004). Evan G. Greenberg, ACE’s President and Chief Executive Officer, Brian Duperreault, ACE’s Chairman and former Chief Executive Officer, and Philip V. Bancroft, ACE’s Chief Financial Officer were also named as defendants in each of these suits. In addition, Dominic J. Frederico, ACE’s former Vice Chairman and former President and Chief Operating Officer, and Christopher Z. Marshall, ACE’s former Chief Financial Officer, were named as defendants in the Burda action. On January 3, 2005, the Burda and Barton actions were consolidated for all purposes into the Mahaney action. In December 2004, the defendants filed a motion with the JPML seeking consolidation of the cases for pretrial purposes in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. That motion is currently pending, and no plaintiffs have yet filed a brief stating a position on consolidation and transfer. The plaintiffs in these cases assert claims solely under Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”), Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, and Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act (control person liability). The plaintiffs allege that ACE’s public statements and securities filings should have revealed that insurers, including certain ACE entities, and brokers conspired to increase premiums and allocate customers through the use of “B” quotes and contingent commissions and that ACE’s revenue and earnings were inflated by premiums which it may have to forfeit by fines or judgments. ACE understands that it has been named as a defendant in a derivative suit filed in Delaware Chancery Court by shareholders of Marsh. The derivative suit seeks to recover damages for Marsh and its subsidiary, Marsh, Inc., against officers and directors of Marsh, American International Group Inc. (AIG), AIG’s chief executive officer, and ACE. The suit alleges that the defendants damaged Marsh and Marsh, Inc. by participating in a bid rigging scheme and obtaining “kickbacks” in the form of contingent commissions. The suit alleges that ACE knowingly participated in the officers’ and directors’ breaches of fiduciary duty to Marsh, Inc. and Marsh. The plaintiff has sought unspecified compensatory damages and reimbursement of expenses, including legal fees. ACE has not been served in this action, though no assurance can be given that it will not be served. On December 6, 2004, Goss International Corporation filed a “Verified Petition for Discovery” in Illinois state court naming several respondents, including ACE, Illinois Union Insurance Co., a subsidiary of ACE, five other insurance companies, Marsh and Marsh Inc. This petition was filed under an Illinois Supreme Court rule which purports to allow a person to engage in discovery for the sole purpose of identifying one who may be responsible in damages in anticipation of filing a complaint. Goss claims that it has used Marsh as its broker, and that Marsh presented quotes to Goss from each of the insurance company respondents. ACE has not been served in this action, though no assurance can be given that it will not be served. Goss and the other defendants, including Illinois Union Insurance Co., have negotiated an agreed briefing schedule pertaining to Goss’s request for pre-suit discovery. If it is served, ACE intends to vigorously oppose the request for pre-suit discovery. All of these suits merely seek compensatory damages without specifying an amount. As a result, ACE cannot at this time estimate its potential costs related to these legal matters and accordingly no liability for compensatory damages has been established in the Consolidated Financial Statements. However, we have recorded expenses for legal fees of $11.5 million in connection with these matters. In the opinion of ACE’s management, ACE’s ultimate liability for these matters is not likely to have a material adverse effect on ACE’s consolidated financial condition, although it is possible that the effect could be material to ACE’s consolidated results of operations for an individual reporting period. 30 Table of Contents Catastrophe Exposure Management We have exposure to catastrophic event risks from global insurance and reinsurance writings of property and workers’ compensation and, to a lesser extent, marine, aviation and energy. This potential loss accumulation, caused by either man-made (for example, terrorism, aviation) or natural perils (for example, hurricane, earthquake) is addressed using several different approaches. First, we have established a series of Product Boards to ensure that geographic, product and client exposures are appropriate and meet both account level and portfolio limit guidelines adopted by the Boards. Second, we have a standardized modeling approach across ACE that utilizes a third-party probabilistic catastrophe simulation software package. Each unit with catastrophe exposure is required to model, price and manage its catastrophe risk using the software. The software allows the aggregation of risk within and across business units. In addition, we maintain minimum data quality standards that must be met in order to quote and bind business. The aggregation of risk across units, products, perils and geography is performed across ACE on a quarterly basis to provide an overall assessment of risk and the results reviewed by senior management each quarter. Management maintains a prudent level of risk through a series of related accumulation thresholds that cap the net retention from single or multiple events; the probability of exhaustion of core catastrophe reinsurance programs, and the net catastrophe loss relative to tangible capital. Third, where the risk / return economics are effective, reinsurance is purchased from reinsurers of appropriate quality and security to protect the business unit level from accumulations arising either within product, peril or business unit or across a combination thereof such that the aggregate risk from a catastrophe loss is appropriate to the unit’s capital structure. Despite the above controls there remains uncertainty about the characteristics, timing and extent of insured loss given the nature of catastrophes. Catastrophe Loss Charges During 2004, we incurred net catastrophe-related losses of $499 million, primarily associated with hurricanes which struck the Caribbean and the U.S. and, to a lesser extent, typhoons which impacted Asia. We believe that the nature and amount of this loss was consistent with our exposure management guidelines discussed above. The following table shows the impact of the catastrophe loss charges on each of our operating segments for the year ended December 31, 2004.

The above information is based on currently available information derived from modeling techniques, industry assessments of exposure and claims information obtained from our clients and brokers. Actual losses from these events may vary materially from our estimates due to the inherent uncertainties in making such determinations resulting from several factors, including the potential inaccuracies and inadequacies in the data provided by clients and brokers, the modeling techniques and the application of such techniques, as well as the high frequency of recent catastrophes and the effects of any resultant demand surge on claims activity. 31 Table of Contents Sale of Financial and Mortgage Guaranty Business through Assured Guaranty Ltd. On April 28, 2004, we completed the sale of 65.3 percent of our financial and mortgage guaranty reinsurance and insurance businesses (transferred business) through the initial public offering (IPO) of 49 million common shares of Assured Guaranty Ltd. (Assured Guaranty) at $18.00 per share. Assured Guaranty was incorporated in Bermuda in August 2003 for the sole purpose of becoming a holding company for our transferred business. Pursuant to the completion of the IPO, we received proceeds, net of related offering costs, of approximately $835 million and a return of capital of $200 million from Assured Guaranty, which were used to support our property and casualty (P&C) business and strengthen our balance sheet capital position. Also, in the fourth quarter of 2004, we accrued $5.4 million related to the 338(h)(10) tax election entered into with Assured Guaranty as part of the IPO transaction (as discussed below). This amount, net of tax, reduced the previously disclosed loss on sale and is recorded in realized gains (losses). Inclusive of the fourth quarter gain, the transaction resulted in a pre-tax loss of $1.3 million, that reduces net realized gains in the consolidated statement of operations, and an after-tax loss of $14.6 million. Additionally, in the second quarter we recognized compensation expense of $7.5 million in connection with the settlement of ACE stock awards held by the employees of Assured Guaranty. These expenses are reflected in “Other (income) expense” within the consolidated statement of operations. In conjunction with the IPO, our tax basis in the stock of Assured Guaranty and the tax basis of certain of Assured Guaranty’s tangible and intangible assets were increased to fair value. The increased tax basis should result in additional tax deductions available to Assured Guaranty over a period of approximately 15 years. To the extent Assured Guaranty generates taxable income sufficient to realize the additional tax deductions, our tax sharing agreement with Assured Guaranty provides that it will be required to pay us the amount of tax savings actually realized, excluding the effect of any loss carrybacks. We do not recognize for accounting purposes the benefit of the savings associated with Assured Guaranty’s asset step-up until the amounts are accruable, based on actual taxable income of the relevant Assured Guaranty entities due to the uncertainty of realization. Subsequent to the IPO, we beneficially own 26 million common shares, or 34.7 percent of Assured Guaranty’s outstanding common shares and accordingly, no longer consolidate our interest in the Assured Guaranty companies. Beginning April 29, 2004, we account for the retained interest under the equity method of accounting with the carrying value of our investment reflected in “Investments in partially-owned insurance companies” within the consolidated balance sheet and our proportionate share of earnings reflected in “Other (income) expense” within the consolidated statement of operations. For segment reporting purposes, our proportionate share of earnings is reflected in our Financial Services segment. In connection with the IPO, we have entered into reinsurance agreements with Assured Guaranty in order to retain the insurance liabilities of certain run-off businesses, including trade credit and residual value insurance. At their inception, these contracts had no effect on our net income. Additionally, we have entered into a number of agreements with Assured Guaranty that will govern certain aspects of the relationship after this offering, including service agreements under which we will provide certain services to Assured Guaranty for a period of time. See Note 3 of our Consolidated Financial Statements for more information pertaining to this transaction. Critical Accounting Estimates Our Consolidated Financial Statements include amounts that, either by their nature or due to requirements of accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (GAAP), are determined using best estimates and assumptions. While we believe that the amounts included in our Consolidated Financial Statements reflect our best judgment, actual amounts could ultimately materially differ from those currently presented in our Consolidated Financial Statements. We believe the items that require the most subjective and complex estimates are: • unpaid losses and loss expense reserves, including asbestos reserves; • reinsurance recoverable, including our bad debt provision; • impairments to the carrying value of our investment portfolio; • the valuation of deferred tax assets; • the fair value of certain derivatives; • the valuation of goodwill; and • assessment of risk transfer for certain structured insurance and reinsurance contracts. We believe our accounting policies for these items are of critical importance to our Consolidated Financial Statements. The following discussion provides more information regarding the estimates and assumptions required to arrive at 32 Table of Contents these amounts and should be read in conjunction with the sections entitled: Unpaid Losses and Loss Expenses, Asbestos and Environmental Claims, Reinsurance, Investments, Net Realized Gains (Losses) and Other Income and Expense Items. Unpaid losses and loss expenses As an insurance and reinsurance company, we are required, under GAAP, to establish loss reserves for the estimated unpaid portion of the ultimate liability for losses and loss expenses under the terms of our policies and agreements with our insured and reinsured customers. These reserves include estimates for both claims that have been reported and those that have been incurred but not reported (IBNR), and include estimates of expenses associated with processing and settling these claims. At December 31 2004, the unpaid losses and loss expense reserve was $31.5 billion. We do not discount our loss reserves, except for net loss and loss expense reserves of $157 million representing structured settlements for which the timing and amount of future claim payments are reliably determinable. The process of establishing reserves for property and casualty claims can be complex and is subject to considerable variability as it requires the use of informed estimates and judgments. These estimates and judgments are based on numerous factors, and may be revised as additional experience and other data become available and are reviewed, as new or improved methodologies are developed or as current laws change. We have actuarial staff in each of our operating segments who analyze insurance reserves and regularly evaluate the levels of loss reserves, taking into consideration factors that may impact the ultimate loss reserves. The potential for variation in loss reserves is impacted by numerous factors, which we explain below. We estimate loss reserves for all of the insurance and reinsurance business that we write. In most cases, we do not have all the necessary information to determine the ultimate settlement value for a claim at the time we are required to accrue for the loss. As a result, historical experience and other statistical information are used to estimate the ultimate cost of the loss, depending on the type of business. To determine carried reserves for a particular line of business, we may perform one or more reserving methods to estimate ultimate losses and loss expenses and use the results to select a single point estimate. These methods may include, but are not necessarily limited to, extrapolations of our historical reported and paid loss data, application of industry loss development patterns to our reported or paid losses, expected loss ratios developed by management, or historical industry loss ratios. Underlying judgments and assumptions that may be incorporated into these actuarial methods include, but are not necessarily limited to, adjustments to historical data used in models to exclude aberrations in claims data such as catastrophes that are typically analyzed separately, application of tail factors used to project ultimate claims from historical loss experience when there are several data points to use, adjustments to actuarial models and related data for known business changes, such as changes in claims covered under insurance contracts, and the effect of recent or pending litigation on future claim settlements. The process of determining a single best estimate by product, when more than one estimate is developed in the course of the actuarial review, may be performed in several ways. However, the objective of such process, which is consistently applied to all product lines, is to determine a single best estimate that we believe represents a better estimate than any other. Such estimate is viewed to support the most likely outcome of ultimate loss settlements and is determined based on several factors, including but not limited to, the extent of historical data and reliance on such data within the underlying reserve methodology, historical accuracy of loss estimates compared with actual loss experience for the product line or comparable product lines, and nature and extent of underlying assumptions. Depending on the facts and circumstances of each product line, the determination of a single best estimate may be accomplished by selecting a single point estimate when one estimate is determined to reflect a “better” estimate than the other point estimates or using a probability weighted average approach when more than one estimate is viewed to be reasonable. For example, an actuary may select loss reserves developed using an incurred loss development approach instead of a paid loss development approach as the best estimate when reported losses are viewed to be more credible indicators of ultimate loss estimates compared with paid losses. The actuaries’ evaluation process to determine a best estimate involves collaboration with underwriting, claims and finance departments and culminates with the input of reserve committees. Each reserve committee includes the participation of the business unit’s actuary, financial management and executive management and has the responsibility for finalizing and approving the point estimate to be used as our best estimate. Reserves are further reviewed by ACE’s Chief Actuary and senior management. We do not calculate a range of loss reserve estimates for our individual loss reserve studies. Actuarial ranges are not a true reflection of the potential volatility between loss reserves estimated at the balance sheet date and the ultimate settlement of losses. This is due to the fact that an actuarial range is developed based on known events as of the valuation date whereas actual volatility or prior period development has historically been reported in subsequent Consolidated Financial Statements, in part from events and circumstances that were unknown as of the original valuation date. We do 33 Table of Contents believe, however, that while our recorded reserves are reasonable and represent management’s best estimate for each individual study, based on known events, our total recorded loss reserves at December 31, 2004, are unlikely to vary by more than ten percent of the recorded amounts, either positively or negatively, based on actual claims emergence over the last several years, excluding A&E development. Historically, including A&E reserve charges, our reserves have developed in excess of ten percent of recorded amounts. See the “Analysis of Losses and Loss Expense Development” for a summary of historical volatility between estimated loss reserves and ultimate loss settlements. While we perform annual loss reserve studies for all product lines, the timing of such studies vary throughout the year. Additionally, for each product line, we review the emergence of actual losses relative to expectations used in reserving each quarter. If warranted from findings in loss emergence tests, we will accelerate the timing of our product line reserve studies. The “Unpaid losses and loss expenses” section below includes a discussion of our reserve-setting procedures by segment. The following is discussion of specific reserving considerations by type of claim: Short-tail business, such as property coverages Short-tail business describes lines of business for which losses are usually known and paid shortly after the loss actually occurs. This would include, for example, most property, personal accident, aviation hull and automobile physical damage policies that are written. Typically, there is less variability in reserve estimates for these lines of business. Long-tail business, such as casualty coverages Long-tail business describes lines of business for which specific losses may not be known for some period and losses take much longer to emerge. This includes most casualty lines such as general liability, directors and officers liability (D&O) and workers’ compensation. There are many factors contributing to the uncertainty and volatility of long-tail business. Among these are: • Given the recent expansion of this business, historical experience is often too immature to place reliance upon for reserving purposes. Instead, particularly for newer lines of business, reserve methods are based on industry loss ratios or development patterns that reflect the nature and coverage of the underwritten business and its future development. For new or growing lines of business, actual loss experience is apt to differ from industry loss statistics that are based on averages as well as loss experience of previous underwriting years; • The inherent uncertainty of the length of paid and reporting development patterns; • The possibility of future litigation, legislative or judicial change that might impact future loss experience relative to prior loss experience relied upon in loss reserve analyses; • Loss reserve analyses typically require loss or other data be grouped by common characteristics in some manner. If data from two combined lines of business exhibit different characteristics, such as loss payment patterns, the credibility of the reserve estimate could be affected. Because casualty lines of business can have various intricacies in their underlying coverage, there is an inherent risk as to the homogeneity of the underlying data used in performing reserve analyses. At December 31, 2004, approximately 74 percent, or $12.7 billion of our net reserves (68 percent excluding A&E reserves) relate to long-tail business. The estimation of unpaid losses and loss expense reserves can also be affected by the layer at which a particular contract or set of contracts is written. In the case of direct insurance, where the insurer is taking on risk in the lower value end of the particular contract, the experience will tend to be more frequency driven. These lines of business allow for more traditional actuarial methods to be used in determining loss reserve levels, as it is customary to have more historical experience to rely upon. In the case of excess of loss contracts, the experience will tend to be more of a severity nature, as only a significant loss will enter the layer. For structured or unique contracts, most common to the financial solutions business and to a lesser extent our reinsurance business, traditional actuarial methods for setting loss reserves (such as loss development triangles), have to be tempered with an analysis of each contract’s terms, original pricing information, subsequent internal and external analyses of the ongoing contracts, market exposures and history, and qualitative input from claims managers. Asbestos and Environmental Reserves (A&E) Included in our liabilities for losses and loss expenses are liabilities for asbestos, environmental and latent injury damage claims and expenses (A&E). These claims are principally related to claims arising from remediation costs associated with hazardous waste sites and bodily-injury claims related to exposure to asbestos products and environmental hazards. The estimation of these liabilities is particularly sensitive to the recent legal environment, including specific settlements that may be used as precedents to settle future claims. 34 Table of Contents In January 2005, we announced net additions to our A&E and other run-off reserves of $364 million exclusive of the provision for bad debts of $95 million. The net additions comprised A&E reserve increases of $453 million and favorable prior period development of $89 million in other run-off reserves. In addition, ACE Overseas General had gross and net A&E additions of $6 million resulting in a total A&E charge of $459 million for 2004. Our A&E reserves, and our range of estimates are not discounted and do not reflect any anticipated changes in the legal, social or economic environment, or any benefit from future legislative reforms. Accordingly, our A&E reserves make no allowance for future state or federal asbestos reforms, such as those currently being contemplated. The majority of our reserve increase in the fourth quarter of 2004 arose with the strengthening of a core group of major accounts impacted by changes in the asbestos industry landscape. In particular, our estimates of future liability were impacted by the continued negative effect of bankruptcies and an increase in defense costs to litigate cases. There are many complex variables that we consider when estimating the reserves for our inventory of asbestos accounts and these variables may directly impact the predicted outcome. We believe the most significant variables relating to our A&E reserves include assumptions regarding multiple recoveries by claimants against various defendants; the ability of a claimant to bring a claim in a state in which they have no residency or exposure; the ability of a policyholder to claim the right to non-products coverage; whether high-level excess policies have the potential to be accessed given the policyholders claim trends and liability situation; payments to unimpaired claimants and the potential liability of peripheral defendants. Based on the policies, the facts, the law and a careful analysis of the impact that these risk factors will likely have on any given account, we estimate the potential liability for indemnity, policyholder defense costs and coverage litigation expense. The results in asbestos cases announced by other carriers may well have little or no relevance to us because coverage exposures are highly dependent upon the specific facts of individual coverage and resolution status of disputes among carrier, policyholder and claimants. Additional information on A&E can be found in the section entitled, “Asbestos and Environmental and Other Run-Off Liabilities”. Reinsurance recoverable Reinsurance recoverable includes the balances due to us from reinsurance companies for paid and unpaid losses and loss expenses, based on contracts in force, and are presented net of a reserve for uncollectible reinsurance – determined based upon a review of the financial condition of the reinsurers and other factors. We determine the reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses and loss expenses using actuarial estimates as well as a determination of our ability to cede unpaid losses and loss expenses under existing reinsurance contracts. The recognition of reinsurance recoverable requires two key judgments. The first judgment involves our estimation of the amount of gross IBNR to be ceded to reinsurers. Ceded IBNR is generally developed as part of our loss reserving process and consequently, its estimation is subject to similar risks and uncertainties as the estimation of gross IBNR (see Critical Accounting Estimate – Unpaid losses and loss expenses). The second judgment involves our estimate of the amount of the reinsurance recoverable balance that we will ultimately be unable to recover from related reinsurers due to insolvency, contractual dispute, or for other reasons. Amounts estimated to be uncollectible are reflected in a bad debt provision that reduces the reinsurance recoverable balance and shareholders’ equity. Changes in the bad debt provision are reflected in net income. At December 31, 2004, the reinsurance recoverable balance includes $15 billion of reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses and loss expenses, less a provision for bad debts of $619 million. The net unpaid recoverables consist of ceded IBNR of $8.2 billion and ceded case reserves of $6.1 billion. Also included are $1.2 billion of reinsurance recoverable on paid loss and loss adjustment expenses, less a provision for bad debts of $309 million. Although the contractual obligation of individual reinsurers to pay their reinsurance obligations is based on specific contract provisions, the collectibility of such amounts requires significant estimation by management. The majority of the balance we have accrued as recoverable will not be due for collection until sometime in the future (in some cases several decades from now). Over this period of time, economic conditions and operational performance of a particular reinsurer may impact their ability to meet these obligations and while they may continue to acknowledge their contractual obligation to do so, they may not have the financial resources or willingness to fully meet their obligation to us. To estimate the bad debt provision, the reinsurance recoverable must first be determined for each reinsurer. This determination is based on a process rather than an estimate, although an element of judgment must be applied. As part of this process, ceded IBNR is allocated by reinsurance agreement, and then by reinsurer, because ceded IBNR is not generally calculated on an agreement-by-agreement basis. The allocations are generally based on premiums ceded under reinsurance agreements, as adjusted for actual loss experience and historical relationships between gross and ceded losses. 35 Table of Contents If actual experience varies materially from historical experience, including that used to determine ceded premium, the allocation of reinsurance recoverable by reinsurer will change. While such change is unlikely to result in a large percentage change in the bad debt provision, it could, nevertheless, have a material effect on our net income in the period recorded. Generally, we use a default analysis to estimate uncollectible reinsurance. The primary components of the default analysis are reinsurance recoverable balances by reinsurer, net of collateral, and default factors used to determine the portion of a reinsurer’s balance deemed uncollectible. The definition of collateral for this purpose requires some judgment and is generally limited to assets held in trust, letters of credit, and liabilities held by us with the same legal entity for which we believe there is a right of offset. Default factors require considerable judgment and are determined using the current rating, or rating equivalent, of each reinsurer as well as other key considerations and assumptions. The more significant considerations include, but are not necessarily limited to, the following: • historical industry default statistics for the reinsurer’s current ratings class, the actual collection experience of the reinsurer, collateral triggers or other contractual provisions that may mitigate default exposure, and the dates the balances will likely become due (duration). For recoverable balances considered representative of the larger population (i.e., default probabilities are consistent with similarly rated reinsurers and payment durations conform to averages), management generally applies industry default factors consistent with the reinsurer’s particular rating class. Such factors have been developed by a major ratings agency; • for balances recoverable from reinsurers that are both unrated by a major rating agency and for which management is unable to determine a credible rating equivalent based on a parent, affiliate, peer company, or internal analysis, additional judgment is required to determine a reasonable default factor. Such default factors are based on either an assessment of the creditworthiness of the particular entity, industry benchmarks, or other factors as considered appropriate; and • for insolvent insurers, management develops default factors based on an evaluation of each of the insolvent entities. At December 31, 2004, the use of different assumptions within the model could have a material effect on the bad debt provision reflected in our Consolidated Financial Statements. To the extent the creditworthiness of our reinsurers were to deteriorate due to an adverse event affecting the reinsurance industry, such as a large number of major catastrophes, actual uncollectible amounts could be significantly greater than our bad debt provision. Such an event could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and our liquidity. Given the various considerations used to develop default factors, we cannot precisely quantify the effect a specific industry event may have on the bad debt provision. However, based on the composition (particularly the average credit quality) of the reinsurance recoverable balance at December 31, 2004, we estimate that a ratings downgrade of all rated reinsurers could increase our bad debt provision by as much as 15 percent, assuming no other changes relevant to the calculation. While a rating downgrade would result in an increase in our provision for bad debt and a charge to earnings in that period, a downgrade in and of itself does not imply that we will not ultimately collect all of the ceded reinsurance recoverable from the reinsurers in question. Additional information on reinsurance recoverable can be found in the section entitled, “Reinsurance”. Investments Consistent with an available-for-sale designation, we report all investments in our portfolio at fair value with changes in fair value reflected in shareholders’ equity as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income. Fair value is determined using the quoted market price of these securities provided by either independent pricing services, or when such prices are not available, by reference to broker or underwriter bid indications. We regularly review our impaired investments (i.e., those debt securities in which fair value is below amortized cost or those equity securities in which fair value is below cost) for a possible other-than-temporary impairment. If we believe a decline in the value of a particular investment is temporary, we record the decline as an unrealized loss in our shareholders’ equity. If we believe the decline is “other than temporary”, we write down the carrying value of the investment and record a realized loss in our consolidated statement of operations. An impairment is considered other-than-temporary unless we have the ability and intent to hold the investment to recovery of fair value up to the cost of the investment, and evidence indicating the cost of the investment is recoverable within a reasonable period outweighs evidence to the contrary. The determination as to whether or not the decline is “other than temporary” principally requires the following critical judgments: i) the circumstances that require management to make a specific assessment as to whether or not the decline is “other than temporary”, such as the time period an investment has been in a loss position and the significance of the decline; and 36 Table of Contents ii) for those securities to be assessed, whether we have the ability and intent to hold the security through an expected recovery period, absent a significant change in facts that is expected to have a material adverse effect on either the financial markets or the financial position of the issuer. With respect to securities where the decline in value is determined to be temporary and the security’s value is not written down, a subsequent decision may be made to sell that security and realize a loss. Subsequent decisions on security sales could be made based on changes in liquidity needs (i.e., arising from a large insured loss such as a catastrophe), internal risk management considerations, the financial condition of the issuer or its industry, market conditions, and new investment opportunities. Day to day management of the majority of our investment portfolio is outsourced to third party investment managers. While these investment managers may, at a given point in time, believe that the preferred course of action is to hold securities with unrealized losses until such losses are recovered, the dynamic nature of portfolio management may result in a subsequent decision to sell the security and realize the loss based upon new circumstances such as those related to the changes described above. We believe that subsequent decisions to sell such securities are consistent with the classification of our portfolio as available for sale. The gross unrealized loss at December 31, 2004, for all securities in a loss position was $71 million. Because our investment portfolio is the largest component of consolidated assets and a multiple of shareholders’ equity, adverse changes in economic conditions subsequent to the balance sheet date could result in other than temporary impairments that are material to our financial condition and operating results. Such economic changes could arise from overall changes in the financial markets or specific changes to industries, companies, or foreign governments in which we maintain relatively large investment holdings. More information regarding our process for reviewing our portfolio for possible impairments can be found in the section entitled “Net Realized Gains (Losses)”. Our exposure to interest rate risk is concentrated in our fixed income portfolio. An increase in interest rates of 50 basis points applied instantly across the yield curve would have resulted in a decrease in the market value of the fixed income portfolio of approximately $400 million at December 31, 2004. An immediate time horizon was used as this presents the worst case scenario. Deferred tax assets Many of our insurance businesses operate in income tax paying jurisdictions. We provide for income taxes in accordance with the provisions of FAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes” (FAS 109). Our deferred tax assets and liabilities primarily result from temporary differences between the amounts recorded in our Consolidated Financial Statements and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities. We determine deferred tax assets and liabilities separately for each tax-paying component (an individual entity or group of entities that is consolidated for tax purposes) in each tax jurisdiction. At December 31, 2004, our net deferred tax asset was $1.2 billion, including $228 million relating to net operating loss carryforwards of $652 million, which will expire in the years 2021-2022 and foreign tax credits of $431 million of which $50 million will expire in the years 2011-2014. The remaining $381 million of foreign tax credits are currently deferred. (See Note 16 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information). Based on our current expectations of future taxable income we estimate that we will utilize all net operating loss carryforwards within the next one to two years. At each balance sheet date, management assesses the need to establish a valuation allowance that reduces deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that all, or some portion, of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The valuation allowance is based on all available information including projections of future taxable income from each tax-paying component in each tax jurisdiction, principally derived from business plans and available tax planning strategies. Projections of future taxable income incorporate several assumptions of future business and operations that are apt to differ from actual experience. If, in the future, our assumptions and estimates that resulted in our forecast of future taxable income for each tax-paying component proves to be incorrect, an additional valuation allowance could become necessary. This could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. At December 31, 2004, the valuation allowance of $89.6 million (including $28.5 million with respect to foreign tax credits) reflects management’s assessment that it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized due to the inability of certain foreign subsidiaries to generate sufficient taxable income or the inability to utilize foreign tax credits. Derivatives FAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” (FAS 133) establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, and for 37 Table of Contents hedging activities. FAS 133 requires that all derivatives be recognized as either assets or liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet and be measured at fair value, with changes in fair value reflected in our net income. We maintain investments in derivative instruments such as futures, options, interest rate swaps and foreign currency forward contracts primarily to manage duration and foreign currency exposure, enhance our portfolio yield or obtain an exposure to a particular financial market. In addition, as part of our investing activities, we purchase “to be announced mortgage backed securities” (TBAs), which we treat as derivatives for reporting purposes. Open derivatives as of the balance sheet date are reported at fair value based on market quotes or valuations provided to us by third party investment managers using market data. Certain products we sell have been determined to meet the definition of a derivative under FAS 133. These products are accounted for at fair value and consist of GMIB reinsurance in our life operation and credit default swaps principally through our ownership interest in Assured Guaranty. We believe that the most meaningful presentation of these derivatives is to reflect revenue as net premiums earned, and to record estimates of losses and loss expenses on specific credit events as incurred losses. When we determine that a loss on a derivative contract is probable, we establish reserves for the loss. Changes in fair value on all derivatives are included in net realized gains (losses). We generally hold these derivative contracts to maturity. Where we hold a derivative to maturity, the cumulative unrealized gains and losses will net to zero if we incur no credit losses on that contract. (See Note 2(o) of the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information) The fair value of these instruments depends on a number of factors including changes in interest rates, changes in equity markets, changes in credit markets and for GMIB reinsurance, changes in the allocation of investments underlying annuitant account value. Where available, we use quoted market prices to determine the fair value of these instruments. If the quoted prices are not available, the fair value is estimated using valuation models for each type of instrument. These models may be developed by third parties, such as rating agencies, or internally based on market conventions for similar transactions, depending on the circumstances. These models and related assumptions are continuously reevaluated by management and enhanced, as appropriate, based upon improvements in modeling techniques and availability of more timely market information, such as market conditions and demographics of in-force annuities. Refer to Item 7A of the Form 10-K for a more detailed discussion of the sensitivity of our GMIB products to market factors. Valuation models include the use of management estimates and current market information. Management is also required to make assumptions on how the fair value of derivative instruments is affected by current market conditions. Management considers factors such as current prices charged for similar agreements, performance of underlying assets, and our ability to obtain reinsurance for our insured obligations. Due to the inherent uncertainties of the assumptions used in the valuation models to determine the fair value of these derivative products, actual experience may differ from the estimates reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements, and the differences may be material. Fair value adjustments attributed to derivative transactions are included in our net realized gains (losses). We recorded a loss of $14 million and a gain of $163 million in 2004 and 2003, respectively. In 2004, the change in fair value was related to many factors, including a loss of approximately $25 million related to the reversal of unrealized gains upon the termination of several credit default swaps and the sale of Assured Guaranty. The credit default swaps covered the equity layer of synthetic CDOs written by our financial solutions business. The unrealized losses were generally offset by increases in net premiums earned. In addition, net realized gains of $10 million were reported for GMIB reinsurance in 2004. In addition, in past years, we had entered into a few other, relatively illiquid, index-based derivative instruments that were reported at fair value. These instruments were principally linked to equity and real estate market indices. The determination of fair value for these derivatives required considerable judgement as there was limited ability to trade the contracts, since they were uniquely structured and the exposure period covered up to 30 years. In early 2004, these contracts were terminated at a gain in conjunction with the sale of Assured Guaranty. Goodwill Goodwill, which represents the excess of the cost of our acquisitions over the tangible net assets we acquired, was $2.6 billion at December 31, 2004. The ACE INA acquisition comprises approximately 80 percent of this balance. FAS 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets”, primarily addresses accounting for goodwill and intangible assets subsequent to their acquisition. Pursuant to FAS 142, goodwill is not amortized to income but instead, is subject to a periodic evaluation of impairment. It is our policy to test goodwill as well as other intangible assets for other than temporary impairments on an annual basis. At January 1, 2002, the initial adoption date of FAS 142, January 1, 2003, and January 1, 2004, goodwill was assigned to the applicable reporting units of the acquired entities giving rise to goodwill. Our reporting units for 38 Table of Contents purposes of impairment testing are primarily based on legal entities within our operating segments. The allocation of goodwill to these reporting units is consistent with goodwill recognized at acquisition. In effect, impairment tests are performed for each acquired entity giving rise to goodwill. The most significant reporting units are the domestic and international divisions of ACE INA, which were acquired in 1999; ACE Tempest Re acquired in 1996; and Tarquin Limited acquired in 1998. There are other reporting units that resulted from smaller acquisitions, that are also assessed annually. The transitional impairment test of goodwill determined that there was no impairment in goodwill in 2002. In our impairment tests, we principally use both an earnings model, that includes relevant financial data of comparable companies to the reporting unit being tested, such as the relationship of price to book value for recent transactions and market valuations of publicly traded companies, and an estimation of fair value based on present value of estimated net cash flows. We must assess whether the current fair value of our operating units is at least equal to the fair value used in the determination of goodwill. In doing this, we make assumptions and estimates about the profitability attributable to our operating segments, as this is important in assessing whether an impairment has occurred. As part of our ongoing management assessments, we regularly analyze our operating companies in an effort to maximize future cash flows and profitability. For 2004, we recorded a goodwill impairment of $13 million primarily as a result of a review conducted during the first quarter which led to a write-down of goodwill relating to our Lloyd’s life syndicate. We recorded a goodwill impairment of $6 million in 2003, due to updated forecasts which supported indications that two relatively small majority-owned companies would not achieve sufficient contract sales volumes to generate and sustain future profitable results. If, in the future, our assumptions and estimates made in assessing the fair value of acquired entities prove to be incorrect, goodwill carried on our balance sheet could be materially overstated. This would cause us to write-down the carrying value of goodwill, resulting in a charge to earnings in the period recorded. Accordingly, this could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period the charge is taken. In 2002, we purchased approximately 22 percent of a Chinese insurance company, Huatai Insurance Company (Huatai). We account for our ownership interest in Huatai under the equity method of accounting. At December 31, 2004, our carrying value for this investment is approximately $147 million, which includes goodwill of approximately $97 million. To date, Huatai’s product offerings have focused on P&C insurance; however, Huatai intends to commence selling life and asset accumulation products in 2005. Based on Huatai’s current business plan and the current state of the Chinese insurance market, we have determined that our investment in Huatai is not impaired at December 31, 2004. Risk transfer In the ordinary course of business, we both purchase, or cede, and sell, or assume, P&C reinsurance protection. For both ceded and assumed reinsurance, risk transfer requirements as per FAS No. 113, “Accounting and Reporting for Reinsurance of Short-Duration and Long-Duration Contracts” (FAS 113), must be met in order to obtain reinsurance accounting, principally resulting in the recognition of cash flows under the contract as premium and losses. If risk transfer requirements are not met, a contract is to be accounted for as a deposit, typically resulting in the recognition of cash flows under the contract through a deposit asset or liability and not as revenue or expense. To meet risk transfer requirements, a reinsurance contract must include both insurance risk, consisting of underwriting and timing risk, and a reasonable possibility of a significant loss for the assuming entity. We also apply similar risk transfer requirements to determine whether certain commercial insurance contracts should be accounted for as insurance or a deposit. Contracts that include fixed premium (i.e., premium not subject to adjustment based on loss experience under the contract) for fixed coverage generally transfer risk and do not require judgment. Reinsurance and insurance contracts that include both significant risk sharing provisions, such as adjustments to premiums or loss coverage based on loss experience, and relatively low policy limits as evidenced by a high proportion of maximum premium assessments to loss limits, can require considerable judgment to determine whether or not risk transfer requirements are met. For such contracts, often referred to as finite or structured products, we require that risk transfer be specifically assessed for each contract by developing expected cash flow analyses at contract inception. To support risk transfer, the cash flow analyses must support the fact that a significant loss is reasonably possible, such as a scenario in which the ratio of the net present value of losses divided by the net present value of premiums equals or exceeds 110 percent. For purposes of cash flow analyses, we generally use a risk-free rate of return consistent with the expected average duration of loss payments. In addition, to support insurance risk, we must prove the reinsurer’s risk of loss varies consistently with that of the reinsured and/or support various scenarios under which the assuming entity can recognize a significant loss. 39 Table of Contents To ensure risk transfer requirements are routinely assessed, quantitative risk transfer analyses and memos supporting risk transfer must be developed by underwriters for all structured products. Furthermore, throughout 2004, such assessments were reviewed and approved by Corporate Accounting. Beginning in December 2004, we formed a Structured Transaction Review Committee that has the responsibility of both reviewing risk transfer assessments and other relevant accounting matters for our structured products as well as certain underwriting criteria specific to structured or finite products. With respect to ceded reinsurance, we have entered into a few multi-year excess of loss retrospectively-rated contracts that provide coverage during 2004 and 2003. These contracts principally provide severity protection for specific product divisions. Because traditional one-year reinsurance coverage had become relatively costly, these contracts were generally entered into to secure a more cost effective reinsurance program. All of these contracts transferred risk and have been accounted for as reinsurance. In addition, we maintain a few aggregate excess of loss reinsurance contracts that were principally entered into prior to 2003, such as the National Indemnity Company (NICO) contracts referred to in the section entitled, “Asbestos and Environmental Claims”. In 2002, we commenced a policy to discontinue the purchase of all finite reinsurance contracts, at both the corporate and product division level. Subsequent to the acquisition of CIGNA P&C, we have not purchased any retroactive ceded reinsurance contracts. With respect to assumed reinsurance and insurance contracts, products giving rise to judgments regarding risk transfer are primarily sold by our financial solutions businesses, included in our Financial Services segment. Such products principally include multi-year retrospectively-rated contracts and loss portfolio transfers. Because transfer of insurance risk is generally a primary client motivation for purchasing these products, relatively few P&C insurance and reinsurance contracts have historically been written for which we concluded that risk transfer criteria had not been met. For certain insurance contracts that have been reported as deposits, the insured desired to self-insure a risk but was required, legally or otherwise, to purchase insurance so that claimants would be protected by a licensed insurance company in the event of non-payment from the insured. 40 Table of Contents Results of Operations – Years Ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 The discussions that follow include tables, which show both our consolidated and segment operating results for the three years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002. In presenting our segment operating results, we have discussed our performance with reference to underwriting results, which is a non-GAAP measure. We consider this measure, which may be defined differently by other companies, to be important in understanding our overall results of operations. Underwriting results are calculated by subtracting losses and loss expenses, life and annuity benefits, policy acquisition costs and administrative expenses from net premiums earned. We use underwriting results and operating ratios to monitor the results of our operations without the impact of certain factors, including net investment income, other (income) expense, interest and income tax expense and net realized gains (losses). We believe the use of these measures enhances the understanding of our results of operations by highlighting the underlying profitability of our insurance business. Underwriting results should not be viewed as a substitute for measures determined in accordance with GAAP. Consolidated Operating Results (in millions of U.S. dollars) 2004 2003 2002 Net premiums written $ 11,528 $ 10,215 $ 8,068 Net premiums earned 11,136 9,602 6,830 Net investment income 1,001 861 802 Net realized gains (loss) 195 252 (489 ) Total revenues $ 12,332 $ 10,715 $ 7,143 Losses and loss expenses 7,714 6,118 4,906 Life and annuity benefits 172 181 158 Policy acquisition costs 1,558 1,357 960 Administrative expenses 1,288 1,160 944 Interest expense 183 177 193 Other expense 2 27 21 Total expenses $ 10,917 $ 9,020 $ 7,182 Income (loss) before income tax 1,415 1,695 (39 ) Income tax expense (benefit) 276 278 (116 ) Net income $ 1,139 $ 1,417 $ 77 Net premiums written, which reflect the premiums we retain after purchasing reinsurance protection, increased 13 percent in 2004, compared with 2003. This increase was driven by P&C net premiums written growth of 22 percent, partially offset by a 70 percent decline in net premiums written in our Financial Services segment. Adjusting for the appreciation of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, net premiums written in our P&C business increased 18 percent in 2004. The increase in our P&C business was primarily a result of growth in property and casualty business due to broader market presence, and growth in personal accident business. In addition, our P&C retention ratio (the ratio of net premiums written to gross premiums written) increased to 71 percent in 2004, compared with 67 percent in 2003. Such increases were partially offset by a decline in net premiums written in our Financial Services business, primarily due to the de-consolidation of Assured Guaranty beginning April 28, 2004 (subsequent to the IPO). Net premiums written increased 27 percent in 2003, compared with 2002, due to growth in P&C gross premiums written and increased retention. 41 Table of Contents The following table provides a consolidated breakdown of net premiums earned by line of business for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002. (in millions of U.S. dollars) 2004 % of total 2003 % of total 2002 % of total Property and all Other $ 3,350 30% $ 2,899 30% $ 2,064 30% Casualty 5,913 53% 4,498 47% 2,780 41% Personal Accident (A&H) 1,133 10% 920 10% 701 10% Total P&C 10,396 93% 8,317 87% 5,545 81% Global Re – life 220 2% 184 2% 158 2% Financial Services 520 5% 1,101 11% 1,127 17% Net premiums earned $ 11,136 100% $ 9,602 100% $ 6,830 100% Net premiums earned reflect the portion of net premiums written that were recorded as revenues for the period as the exposure period expires. Net premiums earned in our P&C business increased 25 percent (21 percent, adjusting for foreign exchange) in 2004, respectively, compared with 2003. Our Financial Services business reported a decrease in net premiums earned of 53 percent in 2004, compared with 2003. The change in net premiums earned for both the P&C and Financial Services businesses is consistent with the trend in net premiums written. Net premiums earned increased 41 percent in 2003, compared with 2002, consistent with the increase in net premiums written. Net investment income increased 16 percent in 2004, compared with 2003. The increase in net investment income is primarily due to positive operating cash flows, which have resulted in a higher overall average invested asset base. The sale of Assured Guaranty during 2004 had the effect of reducing the average invested asset base for Financial Services, which resulted in lower net investment income for that segment. Net investment income increased seven percent in 2003, compared with 2002, also due to the higher average invested asset base. In evaluating our P&C and Financial Services businesses we use the combined ratio, the loss and loss expense ratio, the policy acquisition cost ratio and the administrative expense ratio. We calculate these ratios by dividing the respective expense amounts by net premiums earned. We do not calculate these ratios for the life reinsurance business as we do not use these measures to monitor or manage that business. The combined ratio is determined by adding the loss and loss expense ratio, the policy acquisition cost ratio and the administrative expense ratio. A combined ratio under 100 percent indicates underwriting income, and a combined ratio exceeding 100 percent indicates underwriting losses. The following table shows our consolidated loss and loss expense ratio, policy acquisition ratio, administrative expense ratio and combined ratio for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002. 2004 2003 2002 Loss and loss expense ratio 70.7% 65.0% 73.5% Policy acquisition cost ratio 14.1% 14.2% 14.2% Administrative expense ratio 11.8% 12.3% 14.0% Combined ratio 96.6% 91.5% 101.7% Our loss and loss expense ratio increased 5.7 percentage points in 2004, compared with 2003, primarily due to increased catastrophe losses and A&E reserve strengthening, both recorded in the second half of the year. Partially offsetting the impact of these charges, we experienced less net adverse prior period development in 2004, compared with 2003. The following table shows the impact of catastrophe losses, A&E reserve strengthening and prior period development on our loss and loss expense ratio for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002. 2004 2003 2002 Loss and loss expense ratio, as reported 70.7% 65.0% 73.5% Catastrophe losses 4.7% 1.2% 2.3% A&E reserve strengthening 4.2% — 7.7% Adverse prior period development 1.0% 1.7% 2.9% Loss and loss expense ratio, adjusted 60.8% 62.1% 60.6% 42 Table of Contents We recorded $499 million in catastrophe losses in 2004, compared with $112 million and $156 million in 2003 and 2002, respectively. In the fourth quarter of 2004, we recorded a net increase in A&E and other run-off reserves of $465 million. The net additions comprised A&E reserve increases of $554 million including the provision for bad debts of $95 million and favorable prior period development of $89 million in other run-off reserves. In 2002, net A&E reserves were increased by $516 million. Our loss and loss expense ratio is also impacted by prior period development. Prior period development arises from changes to loss estimates recognized in the current year that relate to loss reserves first reported in previous calendar years and excludes the effect of losses from the development of earned premium from previous accident years. For purposes of analysis and disclosure, management views prior period development to be changes in the nominal value of loss estimates from period to period and excludes changes in loss estimates that do not arise from the emergence of claims, such as those related to uncollectible reinsurance, interest, or foreign currency. Accordingly, specific items excluded from prior period development include the following: gains/losses related to foreign currency translation that affect both the valuation of unpaid losses and loss expenses and losses incurred; losses recognized from the early termination or commutation of reinsurance agreements that principally relate to the time value of money; changes in the value of reinsurance business assumed reflected in losses incurred but principally related to the time value of money and losses that arise from changes in estimates of earned premiums from prior accident years. We experienced net adverse prior period development excluding A&E of $111 million in 2004, compared with net adverse prior period development of $164 million and $193 million in 2003 and 2002, respectively. Our Segment Operating Results, below, contain further detail of the prior period development recognized in our Consolidated Financial Statements. Our losses and loss expenses for 2004 also include $25 million in connection with the commutation of ceded reinsurance contracts that resulted from a differential between consideration received from reinsurers and the related reduction of reinsurance recoverables, principally related to the time value of money. Due to our initiatives to reduce reinsurance recoverable balances and thereby encourage such commutations, losses recognized in connection with the commutation of ceded reinsurance contracts in 2004 and thereafter are not considered when assessing segment performance and accordingly, are directly allocated to the Corporate segment. Additionally, we do not consider the development of loss reserves related to the September 11 tragedy (WTC) in assessing segment performance as these loss reserves are managed by Corporate. Accordingly, the effect of related loss reserve development either positively or negatively on net income is reported within the Corporate segment. During the fourth quarter of 2004, certain adjustments were made to these loss reserves; however, there was no net loss reserve development on a consolidated basis. Although the Corporate segment reported no net loss development, it incurred a tax benefit of $14 million from these adjustments since loss reserves developed adversely in taxable jurisdictions, thereby resulting in a tax benefit, but favorably in non-taxable jurisdictions. As of December 31, 2004, gross and net unpaid losses related to WTC amounted to $756 million and $273 million, respectively. The remaining decrease in the loss and loss expense ratio for 2004 was primarily the result of favorable current accident year experience on property business of approximately $140 million. Partially offsetting this decrease were changes in business mix in our Global Reinsurance and Insurance – North American segments. Global Reinsurance has been growing its non-catastrophe P&C lines while Insurance – North American has been increasing its participation in casualty lines. See the section entitled “Segment Operating Results” for more information. Our policy acquisition costs include commissions, premium taxes, underwriting and other costs that vary with, and are primarily related to, the production of premium. The policy acquisition cost ratio was stable in 2004 compared with 2003 and 2002. For 2004 and 2003, our policy acquisition costs include commission expenses related to Policy Service Agreements (PSAs) of $53 million and $61 million, respectively. Our administrative expense ratios have declined over the last three years due to the favorable impact of expense reduction initiatives which commenced in 2003 and continued into 2004. Administrative expenses in 2004 were negatively impacted by costs associated with compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and by legal expenses incurred in connection with the AG investigations. Interest expense increased slightly in 2004 due to our issuance of $500 million of ACE INA 5.875 percent senior notes during the second quarter, partially offset by our repayment of the $400 million of ACE INA 8.2 percent notes in the third quarter. Interest expense declined in 2003, compared with 2002, primarily due to a reduction in average outstanding trust preferred securities. Other (income) expense includes equity in net income of subsidiary from Assured Guaranty – see the section entitled “Other Income and Expense” for more information. Our effective tax rate on net income was 20 percent in 2004, compared with 16 percent in 2003. This is primarily a result of incurring the majority of the 2004 catastrophe charges in lower-tax jurisdictions, causing our net income to decline without a commensurate decrease in income tax expense. Additionally, in 2004, we incurred approximately $13 million in income tax expense related to federal income taxes from the transfer of our U.S. financial and mortgage guaranty 43 Table of Contents operations to Assured Guaranty and attributed to the sale of our Assured Guaranty shares. The A&E reserve strengthening resulted in tax benefits of $163 million in 2004, which partially reduced our overall effective tax rate on net income. Our effective tax rate is dependent upon the mix of earnings from different jurisdictions with various tax rates; a change in the geographic mix of earnings would change the effective tax rate. The income tax benefit in 2002, relates primarily to the A&E reserve strengthening in that year. Net income declined 20 percent in 2004, compared with 2003, primarily due to increased catastrophe losses and A&E reserve strengthening. The appreciation of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar added $43 million to our net income in 2004. Net income increased significantly in 2003, compared with 2002, which was negatively impacted by A&E reserve strengthening. Segment Operating Results – Years Ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 The performance of our management for the P&C and Financial Services segments are measured based on the results achieved in underwriting income and income excluding net realized gains (losses). Insurance – North American The Insurance – North American segment comprises our P&C insurance operations in the U.S., Bermuda and Canada. This segment writes a variety of insurance products including property, casualty (general liability, workers’ compensation, risk management, professional lines (directors and officers (D&O) and errors and omissions coverages (E&O)), marine, program business, aerospace, consumer-oriented products, specialty lines and accident and health (A&H)—principally being personal accident. For more detail on each of our segments refer to the section entitled, “Segment Information”, under Item 1. (in millions of U.S. dollars) 2004 2003 2002 Net premiums written $ 5,098 $ 4,015 $ 2,919 Net premiums earned 4,678 3,654 2,475 Losses and loss expenses 3,902 2,521 2,200 Policy acquisition costs 440 387 216 Administrative expenses 482 402 341 Underwriting income (loss) $ (146 ) $ 344 $ (282 ) Net investment income 460 403 396 Net realized gains (losses) 124 39 (199 ) Interest expense 21 22 22 Other (income) expense 5 14 (1 ) Income tax expense (benefit) 68 179 (47 ) Net income (loss) $ 344 $ 571 $ (59 ) Loss and loss expense ratio 83.4% 69.0% 88.9% Policy acquisition cost ratio 9.4% 10.6% 8.7% Administrative expense ratio 10.3% 11.0% 13.8% Combined ratio 103.1% 90.6% 111.4% Net premiums written for the Insurance – North American segment increased 27 percent in 2004 compared with 2003. The increase relates primarily to growth in casualty business, which increased 30 percent in 2004, compared with 2003. We have been increasing our participation in the casualty market in order to take advantage of more favorable market conditions (relative to property lines). In recent quarters, we have noted that although rates, terms and conditions continue to produce adequate returns, the growth in casualty premiums has begun to slow due to increased competitive conditions. Despite the softening market conditions, we reported robust growth on the strength of broader market presence, increased product offerings and higher submission flows. In addition, we have been increasing our retention of business due to the improving risk profile of our underlying business and our increasing capital base. Insurance – North American’s retention ratio increased to 63 percent in 2004, compared with 58 percent in 2003, resulting in additional net premiums written of $385 million. Net premiums written for Insurance – North American increased 38 percent in 2003, compared with 2002, primarily due to increased retention of gross premiums written. 44 Table of Contents The following two tables provide a line of business and entity/divisional breakdown of Insurance – North American’s net premiums earned for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002. (in millions of U.S. dollars) 2004 % of total 2003 % of total 2002 % of total Property and all Other $ 1,278 27% $ 1,067 29% $ 945 38% Casualty 3,226 69% 2,446 67% 1,445 59% Personal Accident (A&H) 174 4% 141 4% 85 3% Net premiums earned $ 4,678 100% $ 3,654 100% $ 2,475 100% (in millions of U.S. dollars) 2004 2003 2002 ACE USA $ 3,010 $ 2,173 $ 1,397 ACE Westchester Specialty 1,242 1,061 819 ACE Bermuda 426 420 259 Net premiums earned $ 4,678 $ 3,654 $ 2,475 ACE USA, which includes ACE operations in Canada, provides a broad array of products and services to corporate and consumer clients throughout the U.S. and Canada, primarily through licensed insurance companies. Distribution channels include retail brokers, agents, managing general agents, and managing general underwriters. ACE USA’s net premiums earned increased 39 percent in 2004, compared with 2003, primarily due to growth experienced in the casualty lines in 2003 and early 2004. ACE USA reported solid growth in risk management and excess workers’ compensation (primarily high deductible policies in national accounts business) due to new business, rate increases and higher retention. ACE USA also experienced strong demand for specialty products such as small business workers’ compensation coverage and umbrella, excess coverage as well as liability, professional liability (mainly D&O), environmental, commercial surety and medical coverages. The current year’s growth in net premiums earned has outpaced the growth of net premiums written, reflecting the launch of new products first offered in late 2003, expanded distribution and the more favorable rate environment experienced in 2003. ACE USA reported an increase in net premiums earned of 56 percent in 2003, compared with 2002, primarily due to higher rates and increased volume of P&C business, especially on casualty lines. ACE Westchester Specialty specializes in the wholesale distribution of excess and surplus lines property, inland marine and casualty coverage and products. ACE Westchester Specialty also provides coverage for agriculture business and specialty programs through its Program division. ACE Westchester Specialty’s net premiums earned increased 17 percent in 2004, compared with 2003. This increase primarily reflects higher casualty writings as well as increased agriculture coverage, reflecting growth in new business. ACE Westchester Specialty’s net premiums earned for 2003 increased 30 percent, compared with 2002. This increase was primarily due to higher casualty writings and growth in agriculture business. ACE Bermuda, which specializes in providing professional lines and excess liability coverage, reported stable net premiums earned in 2004, compared with 2003, as increased capacity has fueled competition, and a decline in rates on professional lines and excess property business. ACE Bermuda reported an increase in net premiums earned of 62 percent in 2003, compared with 2002, primarily on the strength of higher renewal rates and increased volume of new business across most of its product offerings. Insurance – North American’s loss and loss expense ratio increased 14.4 percentage points in 2004, compared with 2003. This increase was primarily due to the A&E reserve strengthening, increased catastrophe losses and prior period development. The following table shows the impact of catastrophe losses, A&E reserve strengthening and prior period development on our loss and loss expense ratio for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002. 2004 2003 2002 Loss and loss expense ratio, as reported 83.4% 69.0% 88.9% Catastrophe losses 2.9% 0.6% – A&E reserve strengthening 9.8% – 20.9% Adverse prior period development 4.2% 2.5% 3.2% Loss and loss expense ratio, adjusted 66.5% 65.9% 64.8% 45 Table of Contents Our catastrophe losses for 2004 were $126 million, compared with catastrophe losses of $20 million in 2003. The 2004 loss and loss expense ratio was negatively impacted by the A&E and other run-off reserve strengthening, which resulted in a before-tax charge of $459 million, including the provision for bad debts, for Insurance – North American. The net additions comprised A&E reserve increases of $548 million including the provision for bad debts of $95 million and favorable prior period development of $89 million in other run-off reserves. We also experienced $195 million of net adverse prior period development in 2004, representing 2.9 percent of the segment’s unpaid loss and loss expense reserves at January 1, 2004. This compares with 2003 net adverse prior period development of $91 million, representing 1.6 percent of the segment’s unpaid loss and loss expense reserves at January 1, 2003. The 2004 prior period development was the net result of several underlying favorable and adverse movements, the most significant of which were: • Adverse development of $98 million (accident years 2002 and prior) on the ACE Bermuda high excess professional lines business book due to updated information received for a few known claims with U.S. exposures. • Adverse development of $298 million in our domestic U.S. run-off operations following completion of reserve studies that reflected higher than anticipated actual loss experience. In particular; • Workers’ compensation business (approximately $163 million across accident years 2001 and prior) on several blocks of business including middle market and excess policies, particularly related to a higher severity of claims relative to original expectations arising from various sources such as continued medical inflation and higher allocated claims expense costs. To respond to these trends, for certain workers’ compensation portfolios, a detailed claims audit was performed on a number of our larger blocks of worker compensation business and the latest actuarial studies segregated the claims data into finer components. The result of these efforts was a more detailed and refined analysis which included changes in loss development factors and tail factor selections, and led to the increases in our estimates of ultimate losses during 2004. • General liability business (approximately $60 million across accident years 2002 and prior) on various books of business including primary and excess casualty. This development was principally the result of an increase in the frequency of claims reported relative to initial expectations. • Open market facility writing specialty business ($28 million across accident years 1998-2002). • Aviation business ($27 million in accident years 2003 and prior) primarily related to adverse case reserve development. • Miscellaneous professional liability business ($20 million in accident years 2000 and prior). • Favorable development of $181 million on lines with short-tail exposures (i.e. property and marine) principally related to accident years 2003 and, to a lesser extent, 2002. Such favorable development was the result of lower claims emergence relative to prior years. The 2003 net adverse prior period development was related to casualty lines as adverse prior period development of $74 million was experienced in professional liability, reinsurance of long-term disability and run-off business and $34 million arising from an increase in medical inflation on run-off workers’ compensation affecting accident years 1997-2000. This adverse prior period development was partially offset by $28 million of favorable prior period development on property, excess liability and marine lines of business. Net adverse prior period development of $79 million was incurred in 2002, primarily from run-off business with the remainder being attributed to several lines of business including workers’ compensation, commercial automobile, health care asset management run-off, warranty and financial institutions business. The remaining increase in the loss and loss expense ratio in the three years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, was principally the result of casualty lines comprising a higher proportion of net premiums earned. Due to their longer claim pay-out duration, casualty lines exhibit a higher loss and loss expense ratio relative to other types of business. The impact of the increasing proportion of casualty business on the loss ratio was partially offset by favorable current accident year experience of $35 million on property business. Administrative expenses increased in 2004 and 2003, primarily due to increased staffing costs (primarily underwriting and support unit personnel) and technology spending, related to servicing the growth in Insurance – North American’s product lines. The administrative expense ratio declined in 2004 and 2003, due to an increase in net premiums earned that outpaced the growth in expenses. The policy acquisition ratio for 2003 increased due to our decision to increase our retention ratio by purchasing less reinsurance, which resulted in reduced ceding commissions for Insurance – North American. 46 Table of Contents Insurance – Overseas General The Insurance – Overseas General segment comprises ACE International, our network of indigenous insurance operations, and the insurance operations of ACE Global Markets, our excess and surplus lines writer (which underwrites P&C insurance through Lloyd’s Syndicate 2488 and ACE European Group Limited (formerly known as ACE INA UK Limited)). The Insurance – Overseas General segment writes a variety of insurance products including property, casualty consisting of general liability, professional lines (D&O and E&O), marine, energy, aviation, political risk, consumer-oriented products and A&H – principally being personal accident. For more detail on each of our segments refer to the section entitled, “Segment Information”, under Item 1.

Additionally, the retention ratio for Insurance – Overseas General increased to 75 percent in 2004, compared with 72 percent in 2003. This increase in retention added $175 million to net premiums written in 2004. Net premiums written increased 38 percent in 2003, compared with 2002, due to rate increases, new business and the weakening of the U.S. dollar. ACE International’s P&C operations are organized geographically and along product lines. Property insurance products include traditional commercial fire coverage as well as energy industry-related coverages. Principal casualty products are commercial general liability and liability coverage for multinational organizations. Through our professional lines, we provide D&O and professional indemnity coverages for medium to large clients. The A&H insurance operations provide principally accident coverage to individuals and groups outside of U.S. insurance markets. In 2004, ACE International recorded an increase in net premiums written of 22 percent (11 percent adjusting for foreign exchange) to $3.2 billion. ACE International’s increase in net premiums written was primarily driven by ACE Europe and ACE Asia Pacific, as both regions reported strong growth in P&C and A&H lines, mainly due to new business recorded in the first three quarters of the year. More recently, we have seen increased competitive conditions in Europe and the U.K. which have resulted in rates being flat or lower for ACE Europe’s P&C and A&H lines. ACE Latin America reported growth in A&H business. ACE International’s net premiums written increased 38 percent in 2003, compared with 2002, due to rate increases, new business and the weakening of the U.S. dollar. ACE Global Markets’ main lines of business include aviation, property, energy, professional lines, marine, political risk and A&H. ACE Global Markets’ net premiums written increased three percent to $1.1 billion in 2004 (unchanged, adjusting for foreign exchange). ACE Global Markets’ net premiums written increased 40 percent in 2003, compared with 2002, primarily due to rate increases, increased retention of gross premiums written and the depreciation of the U.S. dollar. 47 Table of Contents The following two tables provide a line of business and entity/divisional breakdown of Insurance – Overseas General’s net premiums earned for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002. (in millions of U.S. dollars) 2004 % of total 2003 % of total 2002 % of total Property and all Other $ 1,370 32% $ 1,125 32% $ 637 27% Casualty 1,994 46% 1,659 46% 1,140 48% Personal Accident (A&H) 958 22% 779 22% 616 25% Net premiums earned $ 4,322 100% $ 3,563 100% $ 2,393 100% (in millions of U.S. dollars) 2004 2003 2002 ACE Europe $ 1,934 $ 1,466 $ 925 ACE Asia Pacific 491 390 246 ACE Far East 382 367 335 ACE Latin America 355 297 225 ACE International 3,162 2,520 1731 ACE Global Markets 1,160 1,043 662 Net premiums earned $ 4,322 $ 3,563 $ 2,393 Insurance – Overseas General increased net premiums earned 21 percent in 2004, compared with 2003 (13 percent adjusting for foreign exchange). Consistent with the trend in net premiums written, the major driver of growth was ACE Europe which contributed close to 62 percent of Insurance – Overseas General’s increase in net premiums earned in 2004. ACE Europe has been experiencing several quarters of increased production across most of its product offerings and has also been bolstered by the appreciation of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar. Net premiums earned increased 49 percent in 2003, compared with 2002, principally due to new business, higher rates and the devaluation of the U.S. dollar. Insurance – Overseas General’s loss and loss expense ratio decreased 4.1 percentage points in 2004, primarily due to favorable current accident year experience on property business, which amounted to $95 million. The following table shows the impact of catastrophe losses, and prior period development on our loss and loss expense ratio for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002. 2004 2003 2002 Loss and loss expense ratio, as reported 56.1% 60.2% 60.8% Catastrophe losses 1.4% 0.3% 2.8% Adverse prior period development 0.2% 1.6% 4.3% Loss and loss expense ratio, adjusted 54.5% 58.3% 53.7% Catastrophe losses for 2004 were $53 million, compared with $10 million and $68 million for 2003 and 2002, respectively. We experienced $12 million of net adverse prior period development in 2004 (including $6 million relating to A&E reserve strengthening), representing 0.2 percent of the segment’s unpaid loss and loss expense reserves at January 1, 2004. This compares with 2003 net adverse prior period development of $57 million, representing 2.3 percent of the segment’s unpaid loss and loss expense reserves at January 1, 2003. The 2004 prior period development was the net result of several underlying favorable and adverse movements, the most significant of which were: • Favorable development of $103 million on short-tail property and fire lines (primarily accident year 2003 and to a lesser extent 2002) primarily due to the emergence of favorable loss experience, mostly at ACE Europe and ACE Asia Pacific. • Adverse development of $42 million on aviation business as a result of a lengthening of development patterns used in loss reserving analysis driven by recent claims emergence. • Adverse development of $28 million on casualty lines due to changes in actuarial reserving assumptions and in particular those to derive allocated loss adjustment expense reserves, following detailed actuarial review. • Adverse development of $12 million on political risk due to adverse loss experience most notably on expropriation and repayment default claims in Argentina. 48 Table of Contents • Adverse development of $10 million on A&H, primarily driven by continued poor experience on Norwegian occupational injury (primarily accident years 2001–2003). • Adverse development of $10 million on run-off retrocessional business following review of individual treaties. The 2003 net adverse prior period development was driven by $54 million of adverse prior period development on specialty lines, including marine and satellite and also $38 million on casualty lines related to the lengthening of development patterns. This adverse prior period development was partially offset by $47 million of favorable loss experience on short-tail property and fire lines. Net adverse prior period development of $104 million was incurred in 2002, primarily related to casualty and D&O lines for ACE International and aerospace business for ACE Global Markets. The policy acquisition cost ratio for Insurance – Overseas General improved in 2004, due to changes in business mix and also due to underwriters’ continued focus on reducing commission charges, particularly within ACE Global Markets’ financial lines. Insurance – Overseas General’s administrative expenses increased 14 percent in 2004, primarily due to the depreciation of the U.S. dollar and increased staff costs at ACE Europe and ACE Asia Pacific. The administrative expense ratio for Insurance – Overseas General improved due to the increase in net premiums earned coupled with a reduction in Lloyd’s charges within ACE Global Markets. In 2003, the policy acquisition ratio declined compared with 2002, primarily due to changes in business mix. Administrative expenses increased in 2003, compared with 2002, primarily due to the increased cost associated with supporting business growth across all regions of the world and the depreciation of the U.S dollar. Global Reinsurance The Global Reinsurance segment comprises the operations of the ACE Tempest Group – ACE Tempest Re Bermuda, ACE Tempest Re USA, ACE Tempest Re Europe, and ACE Tempest Life Re (ACE Life Re). ACE Life Re is our Bermuda-based life reinsurance operation and is addressed separately. For more detail on each of our segments refer to the section entitled, “Segment Information”, under Item 1. Property and Casualty Reinsurance (in millions of U.S. dollars) 2004 2003 2002 Net premiums written $ 1,524 $ 1,225 $ 777 Net premiums earned 1,396 1,100 677 Losses and loss expenses 973 559 304 Policy acquisition costs 271 211 123 Administrative expenses 65 62 40 Underwriting income (loss) $ 87 $ 268 $ 210 Net investment income 126 87 82 Net realized gains (losses) 27 55 (43 ) Interest expense – – 1 Other (income) expense (1 ) (3 ) (1 ) Income tax expense 15 14 1 Net income $ 226 $ 399 $ 248 Loss and loss expense ratio 69.7% 50.9% 44.9% Policy acquisition cost ratio 19.4% 19.2% 18.1% Administrative expense ratio 4.6% 5.6% 5.9% Combined ratio 93.7% 75.7% 68.9% 49 Table of Contents Global Reinsurance’s net premiums written increased 24 percent in 2004, compared with 2003, primarily due to higher non-catastrophe P&C production at ACE Tempest Re USA and ACE Tempest Re Europe, partially offset by a decrease in property catastrophe business at ACE Tempest Re Bermuda. In addition, Global Reinsurance’s retention ratio increased to 97 percent in 2004, compared with 93 percent in 2003. This increase in retention added $63 million to Global Reinsurance’s net premiums written. Net premiums written increased 58 percent in 2003, compared with 2002, driven by higher rates and increased P&C volume. The following two tables provide a line of business and entity/divisional breakdown of Global Reinsurance’s net premiums earned for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002. (in millions of U.S. dollars) 2004 % of total 2003 % of total 2002 % of total Property and all Other $ 374 27% $ 311 28% $ 149 22% Casualty 693 50% 394 36% 159 23% Property catastrophe 329 23% 395 36% 369 55% Net premiums earned $ 1,396 100% $ 1,100 100% $ 677 100% (in millions of U.S. dollars) 2004 2003 2002 ACE Tempest Re Europe $ 303 $ 259 $ 142 ACE Tempest Re USA 756 463 182 ACE Tempest Re Bermuda 337 378 353 Net premiums earned $ 1,396 $ 1,100 $ 677 Net premiums earned increased 27 percent in 2004, compared with 2003, and 62 percent in 2003, compared with 2002. The increases were primarily due to the growing proportion of non-catastrophe P&C business relative to catastrophe business over the last three years. ACE Tempest Re USA, which focuses on writing property per risk and casualty reinsurance, reported a 63 percent increase in net premiums earned in 2004, compared with 2003, primarily due to increased casualty business written and higher renewal rates. ACE Tempest Re Europe, which writes most lines of P&C with an orientation towards specialty and short-tail products, reported a 17 percent increase in net premiums earned in 2004. This increase was primarily due to the robust casualty market in 2003 and early 2004, which offset weakness in property catastrophe and aviation. ACE Tempest Re Bermuda, which principally provides property catastrophe reinsurance globally to insurers of commercial and personal property, reported an 11 percent decrease in net premiums earned in 2004. A market-wide decline in rates on property catastrophe business, combined with our underwriting discipline has resulted in downward pressure on premium production for ACE Tempest Re Bermuda. The loss and loss expense ratio increased 18.8 percentage points in 2004 compared with 2003, primarily due to increased catastrophe losses. The following table shows the impact of catastrophe losses and prior period development on our loss and loss expense ratio for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002. (in millions of U.S. dollars) 2004 2003 2002 Loss and loss expense ratio, as reported 69.7% 50.9% 44.9% Catastrophe losses 21.6% 7.5% 13.0% Favorable prior period development (4.4)% (2.5)% (3.0)% Loss and loss expense ratio, adjusted 52.5% 45.9% 34.9% We recorded $309 million in catastrophe losses in 2004, compared with $82 million and $88 million in 2003 and 2002, respectively. We experienced $61 million of net favorable prior period development in 2004, representing 6.6 percent of the segment’s unpaid loss and loss expense reserves at January 1, 2004. This compares with 2003 net favorable prior period development of $27 million, representing 5.2 percent of the segment’s unpaid loss and loss expense reserves at January 1, 2003. The 2004 favorable prior period development related primarily to property and other short-tail lines and resulted 50 Table of Contents from a difference between the actual experience and the expected claims emergence used to establish the reserves for accident years 2003 and 2002. The 2003 favorable prior period development related principally to the better than expected claims experience on property and short-tail lines. Net favorable prior period development of $20 million was incurred in 2002, primarily due to lower than expected losses on property catastrophe business. The remaining increase in the loss and loss expense ratio was primarily related to the shift in mix of business that has resulted from growth in non-catastrophe P&C business at ACE Tempest Re USA and ACE Tempest Re Europe. Non-catastrophe P&C business typically exhibits higher loss ratios than property catastrophe business (except in periods with high catastrophe losses). As Global Reinsurance increases non-catastrophe P&C writing, we expect its loss and loss expense ratio to continue to increase in line with what would be expected from a traditional multi-line reinsurer. Global Reinsurance’s policy acquisition cost ratio increased in 2004 and 2003, due to the higher proportion of business generated from ACE Tempest Re USA, relative to ACE Tempest Re Europe and ACE Tempest Re Bermuda. ACE Tempest Re USA’s business is written more on a pro-rata basis (versus excess-of-loss), which incurs higher acquisition costs due to the higher level of ceding commissions paid. Administrative expenses increased in 2004 and 2003, primarily due to higher staffing costs to support growth in business at ACE Tempest Re USA. The administrative expense ratio decreased in 2004 and 2003 due to increased net premiums earned. Life Reinsurance ACE Life Re principally provides reinsurance coverage to other life insurance companies, focusing on guarantees included in certain fixed and variable annuity products. The reinsurance transactions we enter into typically help clients (ceding companies) to manage mortality, morbidity, lapse and/or capital market risks embedded in their books of business. We use sophisticated stochastic modeling techniques to price our reinsurance products based on robust actuarial and investment models which incorporate a number of factors. These factors include assumptions for mortality, morbidity, expenses, demographics, persistency, investment returns, macroeconomic factors such as inflation and taxation and certain regulatory factors such as reserve and surplus requirements. Our reinsurance treaties are non-proportional in nature, all of which incorporate some form of annual claim limit, and many of which include an aggregate claim limit as well as either an annual or aggregate claim deductible. We also use modeling software to monitor, measure, and manage the aggregate exposure which is bound by limits set by senior management. We assess the performance of our life reinsurance business based on life underwriting income which includes net investment income. (in millions of U.S. dollars) 2004 2003 2002 Net premiums written $ 220 $ 185 $ 159 Net premiums earned 220 184 158 Life and annuity benefits 172 181 158 Policy acquisition costs 22 16 16 Administrative expenses 4 3 6 Net investment income 33 33 27 Life underwriting income 55 17 5 Net realized gains (losses) 7 (21 ) (14 ) Net income (loss) $ 62 $ (4 ) $ (9 ) Life underwriting income improved in 2004, compared with 2003, primarily due to the increase in net premiums earned, combined with lower life and annuity benefits. Net premiums earned increased in 2004 primarily due to higher variable annuity production, while life and annuity benefits declined due to the increased proportion of premium volume from variable annuity products, which typically have lower expected benefit pay-outs than other business. Net income increased, due to higher life underwriting income, combined with net realized gains which arose primarily due to movement in interest rates and the equity market in 2004 and the corresponding fair value adjustment on GMIBs, which amounted to a $10 million gain. Life underwriting income increased $12 million in 2003, compared with 2002, primarily due to higher investment income, combined with lower administrative expenses due to reduced staff levels. Financial Services The Financial Services segment consists of our financial solutions business and our proportionate share of Assured Guaranty’s earnings, which is 100 percent through April 28, 2004, and 34.7 percent thereafter. The financial solutions operations 51 Table of Contents provide one-off insurance and reinsurance solutions to clients with unique or complex risks, which are not adequately addressed in the traditional insurance market. Each financial solutions contract is structured to meet the needs of each client. Assured Guaranty provides credit enhancement products to the municipal finance, structured finance and mortgage markets. For more detail on each of our segments refer to the section entitled, “Segment Information”, under Item 1. Certain products (principally credit protection oriented) issued by the Financial Services segment have been determined to meet the definition of a derivative under FAS 133. For more information see the section entitled “Critical Accounting Estimates”. From April 29, 2004, our proportionate share of Assured Guaranty’s earnings is reflected in “Other (income) expense” in our consolidated statement of operations. The equity in net income recorded from Assured Guaranty in 2004 was $46 million. (in millions of U.S. dollars) 2004 2003 2002 Net premiums written $ 316 $ 1,039 $ 1,497 Net premiums earned 520 1,101 1,127 Losses and loss expenses 388 894 947 Policy acquisition costs 22 61 72 Administrative expenses 40 84 57 Underwriting income (loss) $ 70 $ 62 $ 51 Net investment income 147 202 190 Net realized gains (losses) (17 ) 190 (117 ) Interest expense 5 6 10 Other (income) expense (26 ) – (1 ) Income tax expense 35 64 13 Net income $ 186 $ 384 $ 102 Loss and loss expense ratio 74.6% 81.2% 84.0% Policy acquisition cost ratio 4.3% 5.5% 6.4% Administrative expense ratio 7.5% 7.7% 5.0% Combined ratio 86.4% 94.4% 95.4% Financial Services reported a decrease in net premiums written of 70 percent in 2004, compared with 2003. The decline was primarily a result of the sale of Assured Guaranty, which reduced net premiums written by $509 million. Additionally, the financial solutions operations reported LPT production of $27 million in 2004, compared with $274 million in 2003. With respect to the financial solutions business, premium volume can vary significantly from period to period and therefore premiums written in any one period are not indicative of premiums to be written in future periods. Financial Services’ net premiums written decreased 31 percent in 2003, compared with 2002, primarily due to the termination of equity layer CDOs in connection with our sale of Assured Guaranty. The Financial Services segment reported an increase in underwriting income of 13 percent in 2004, compared with 2003. The increase was mainly driven by a lower loss and loss expense ratio in our financial guaranty operations prior to the IPO of Assured Guaranty. This improvement in the loss and loss expense ratio was a result of the settlement of one-off transactions in preparation for the IPO. Underwriting income increased 22 percent in 2003, compared with 2002, primarily due to a lower loss and loss expense ratio. We experienced $29 million of net favorable prior period development in 2004, representing one percent of the segment’s unpaid loss and loss expense reserves at January 1, 2004. This compares with 2003 net adverse prior period development of $43 million, representing 1.7 percent of the segment’s unpaid loss and loss expense reserves at January 1, 2003. The 2004 development was primarily related to $38 million of favorable prior period development in connection with the receipt of ceding company reports updating claims information on large high excess of loss assumed multi-year contract and $14 million arising on a multi-year claims made insurance policy for which it was determined that certain claims previously recognized in 2002 and 2003 would fall below policy attachment points. The favorable prior period development was partially offset by $20 million of adverse prior period development on several contracts following actuarial reviews that concluded with updated loss development patterns. The 2003 adverse prior period development arose principally on the structured finance line of business due to credit deterioration in collateralized debt obligations assumed through reinsurance treaties and, to a lesser extent, an increase in a case reserve on an auto residual value transaction. Net adverse prior period development of $30 million was incurred in 2002, primarily from the ACE Financial Solutions International book, which comprises large, unique transactions, including LPTs. 52 Table of Contents Net Investment Income Years Ended December 31 (in millions of U.S. dollars) 2004 2003 2002 Insurance – North American $ 460 $ 403 $ 396 Insurance – Overseas General 233 155 106 Global Reinsurance – P&C 126 87 82 Global Reinsurance – Life 33 33 27 Financial Services 147 202 190 Corporate and Other 2 (19 ) 1 Net investment income $ 1,001 $ 861 $ 802 Net investment income is influenced by a number of factors, including the amounts and timing of inward and outward cash flows, the level of interest rates, and changes in overall asset allocation. Net investment income increased 16 percent in 2004, compared with 2003, and seven percent in 2003 compared with 2002. The increased net investment income is due to the positive operating cash flows over the last three years which have resulted in a higher overall average invested asset base. An increase in U.S. interest rates during the fourth quarter of 2004 resulted in an increase in the investment portfolio’s average yield on fixed maturities to 4.1 percent at December 31, 2004. This compares with an average yield on fixed maturities of 4.0 percent and 4.4 percent at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The sale of Assured Guaranty during the year had the effect of reducing the average invested asset base for Financial Services which resulted in lower net investment income for that segment. Net Realized Gains (Losses) Our investment strategy takes a long-term view, and our investment portfolio is actively managed to maximize total return within certain specific guidelines, designed to minimize risk. Our investment portfolio is reported at fair value. The effect of market movements on our investment portfolio impact income (through net realized gains (losses)) when securities are sold, when “other than temporary” impairments are recorded on invested assets or through the reporting of derivatives at fair value, including financial futures and options, interest rate swaps, GMIB reinsurance, and credit-default swaps. Changes in unrealized appreciation and depreciation on available-for-sale securities, which result from the revaluation of securities held, are reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders’ equity. The following table presents our pre-tax net realized gains (losses) for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002. (in millions of U.S. dollars) 2004 2003 2002 Fixed maturities and short-term investments $ 112 $ 100 $ (58 ) Equity securities 84 (41 ) (157 ) Other investments (21 ) (25 ) (12 ) Currency 1 21 3 Derivatives: Financial futures, options, spread locks swaps and interest rate swaps 33 34 (188 ) Fair value adjustment on insurance derivatives (14 ) 163 (77 ) Subtotal derivatives 19 197 (265 ) Total net realized gains (losses) $ 195 $ 252 $ (489 ) Consistent with our investment objectives and the classification of our investment portfolio as available for sale, subject to guidelines as to asset classes, credit quality, and liquidity approved by our Finance Committee, our investment managers generally have the ability to sell fixed maturity, short-term, or equity investments when they determine that an alternative security with comparable risks is likely to provide a higher investment return, considering the realized gain or loss on sale and differential in future investment income. Often, sales of individual securities occur when investment managers conclude there are changes in the credit quality of a particular security or, for other reasons, market value is apt to 53 Table of Contents deteriorate. Further, we may sell securities when we conclude it is prudent to reduce a concentration in a particular issuer or industry. Therefore, sales volume may increase in a volatile credit market in which credit spreads and thus the market value of fixed maturity investments are subject to significant changes in a short period of time. The interest rate environment will tend to have a limited effect on sales volume but extreme conditions could have an affect on the magnitude of realized gains or losses. For example, in a declining rate environment, the market value of securities increase, resulting in a greater likelihood of net realized gains and we would therefore tend to reduce the average duration of our fixed maturity investment portfolio. An increasing rate environment would tend to have the opposite effect. The effect of a high level of realized losses or gains for a particular period will tend to be offset by increases or decreases in investment income, respectively, in subsequent periods. From a liquidity perspective, our greatest risk is that we could be forced to sell a large volume of securities at a loss (i.e., in a high interest rate environment) to meet operating needs and are thus unable to reinvest proceeds to recoup such losses with future investment income (see section entitled “Liquidity and Capital Resources” for more information). FAS 133 requires us to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet, and measure them at fair value. We record the gains and losses resulting from the fair value measurement of derivatives in net realized gains (losses). We participate in derivative instruments in two principal ways as follows: i) to offer protection to others as the seller or writer of the derivative, such as our reinsurance of guaranteed minimum income benefits (GMIBs) that are treated as derivatives for accounting purposes and our credit derivatives; or ii) to mitigate our own risk, principally arising from our investment holdings. We do not consider either type of transaction to be speculative. In 2004, we recorded net realized gains of $19 million on all derivative transactions. This compares with net realized gains on all derivatives of $197 million in 2003 and net realized losses on all derivatives of $265 million in 2002. Estimated changes in fair value would be recorded as net realized losses in our net income. Refer to Item 7A. of this Form 10-K for an analysis of the impact on our net income of changes in interest rates and the Standard and Poor’s (S&P) index. The gain or loss created by the estimated fair value adjustment will rise or fall each period based on estimated market pricing and may not be an indication of ultimate claims. Fair value is defined as the amount at which an asset or liability could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties. We generally plan to hold derivative financial instruments to maturity. Where we hold derivative financial instruments to maturity, these fair value adjustments would generally be expected to reverse resulting in no gain or loss over the entire term of the contract. However, in the event that we terminate a derivative contract prior to maturity, as a result of a decision to exit a line of business or for risk management purposes, the difference between the final settlement of cash inflows and outflows and financial statement accruals for premiums and losses will be reflected as premiums earned and losses incurred, respectively. Additionally, at termination, any unrealized gain or loss, previously classified as a realized gain or loss, will be reversed and classified as a realized loss or gain, respectively. With respect to our GMIB reinsurance and credit derivatives businesses (insurance derivatives), we record a portion of the change in fair value in unpaid loss and loss expenses and future policy benefits for life and annuity contracts, respectively, representing our best estimate of loss pay-outs related to fees or premiums earned, and a portion in net realized gains (losses), representing other changes in fair value. For 2004, the fair value adjustment included in net realized gains (losses), was net realized losses of $14 million. This compares with net realized gains of $163 million and net realized losses of $77 million in 2003 and 2002, respectively. In 2004, the change in fair value was related to many factors including a loss of approximately $25 million related to the reversal of unrealized gains upon the termination of several credit default swaps. These credit default swaps were covering the equity layer of synthetic CDOs written by our financial solutions business. The unrealized losses were generally offset by increases in net premiums earned. In addition, net realized gains of $10 million were reported for GMIB reinsurance in 2004. The changes in the fair value of GMIBs are determined using internal valuation models. Such valuations require considerable judgment and are subject to significant uncertainty. The valuation of these products is subject to fluctuations arising from, among other factors, changes in interest rates, changes in the equity markets, and changes in the allocation of the investments underlying annuitant’s account value. These models and the related assumptions are continually reviewed by management and enhanced, as appropriate, based upon improvements in modeling techniques and availability of more timely information, such as market conditions and demographics of in-force annuities. A net realized gain of $33 million was recorded on financial futures and option contracts and interest rate swaps in 2004. This compares with net realized gains of $34 million in 2003, and net realized losses of $188 million in 2002. We recorded a net realized gain of $8 million on interest rate swaps in 2004, compared with a net realized loss of $6 million in 2003. The interest rate swaps are designed to reduce the negative impact of increases in interest rates on our fixed maturity portfolio. In 2004, we recorded a net realized gain of $29 million on our S&P equity index futures contracts, as 54 Table of Contents the S&P 500 equity index increased nine percent during the year. We use foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the effect of fluctuating foreign currencies on certain non-U.S. dollar holdings in our portfolio that are not specifically matching foreign currency liabilities. These contracts are not designated as specific hedges and we record all realized and unrealized gains and losses on these contracts as net realized gains (losses) in the period in which the currency values change. We regularly review our investment portfolio for possible impairment based on criteria including economic conditions, credit loss experience and issuer-specific developments. If there is a decline in a security’s net realizable value, we must determine whether that decline is temporary or “other than temporary”. If we believe a decline in the value of a particular investment is temporary, we record it as an unrealized loss in our shareholders’ equity. If we believe the decline is “other than temporary”, we write down the carrying value of the investment and record a net realized loss in our statement of operations. The decision to recognize a decline in the value of a security carried at fair value as “other than temporary” rather than temporary has no impact on our book value. Once a security is identified as having a potential “other than temporary” impairment, we determine whether or not cost will ultimately be recovered and whether we have the intent and ability to hold the security until an expected recovery period, absent a significant change in facts that is expected to have a material adverse financial effect on the issuer. Our net realized gains (losses) in 2004 included write-downs of $18 million related to fixed maturity investments, $9 million related to equity securities and $12 million related to other investments, as a result of conditions which caused us to conclude the decline in fair value of the investment was “other than temporary”. This compares with write-downs of $29 million related to fixed maturity investments, $63 million related to equity securities and $29 million related to other investments in 2003. For 2002, our net realized gains (losses) included write-downs of $101 million related to fixed maturity investments, $153 million related to equity securities and $14 million related to other investments. The process of determining whether a decline in value is temporary or “other than temporary” requires considerable judgment and differs depending on whether or not the security is traded on a public market as well as by type of security. As a result of our periodic review process, we have determined that there currently is no need to sell any of these securities to fund anticipated payments. We review all of our fixed maturity securities, including securities on loan, and equity securities for potential impairment each quarter. See Note 4 (f) to the Consolidated Financial Statements for criteria we consider in assessing potential impairment. Note 4 (f) also includes a table which summarizes all of our securities in an unrealized loss position at December 31, 2004. Other Income and Expense Items Years Ended December 31 (in millions of U.S. dollars) 2004 2003 2002 Equity in net income of unconsolidated entities $ (42 ) $ (6 ) $ (5 ) Minority interest expense 22 18 3 Goodwill impairment 13 6 – Other 9 9 23 Other (income) expense $ 2 $ 27 $ 21 Other expense decreased in 2004, compared with 2003, primarily due to equity in net income of unconsolidated entities, which was primarily comprised of $46 million from Assured Guaranty. Minority interest expense increased due to higher profitability in our rent-a-captive operations. Goodwill impairments increased primarily as a result of a review conducted during the first quarter of 2004 which led to a write-down of goodwill relating to our Lloyd’s life syndicate. Other for 2004 includes compensation expense in connection with the settlement of ACE stock awards held by the employees of Assured Guaranty. The other expense for 2003 related to charges for commutation of a reinsurance contract. In 2004 and thereafter, these charges are included in the Corporate segment. Included in other for 2002 was $25 million in debt prepayment expense on the ACE INA Subordinated Notes due in 2009. This cost was primarily attributable to a decline in interest rates since the note was originally issued. 55 Table of Contents Investments Our principal investment objective is to ensure that funds are available to meet our insurance and reinsurance obligations. Within this broad liquidity constraint, the purpose of our investment portfolio’s structure is to maximize total return subject to specifically approved guidelines of overall asset classes, credit quality, and liquidity and volatility of expected returns. Our investment portfolio is invested primarily in fixed income securities with an average credit quality of AA, as rated by the independent investment rating service S&P. The portfolio is externally managed by independent, professional, investment managers. The average duration of our fixed income securities, including the effect of interest rate swaps, was 3.4 years at December 31, 2004, and 2003. Our “other investments” principally comprise direct investments, investments in investment funds and investments in limited partnerships. The following table identifies our invested assets by type held at fair value and cost/amortized cost at December 31, 2004 and 2003. December 31, 2004 December 31, 2003 (in millions of U.S. dollars) Fair Value Cost/AmortizedCost Fair Value Cost/Amortized Cost Fixed maturities $ 21,739 $ 21,296 $ 18,645 $ 18,006 Securities on loan 1,038 997 684 650 Short-term investments 3,199 3,199 2,928 2,928 25,976 25,492 22,257 21,584 Equity securities 1,229 1,039 544 401 Investments in partially-owned insurance companies 797 755 277 269 Other investments 504 450 368 333 Total investments $ 28,506 $ 27,736 $ 23,446 $ 22,587 We also gain exposure to equity markets through the use of derivative instruments. The combined equity exposure through both our equity portfolio and derivative instruments was valued at $1.4 billion and $662 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The increase in our equity exposure is due to our efforts to diversify our portfolio and additionally due to increased equity returns in 2004, compared with 2003. “Investments in partially-owned insurance companies” includes our 34.7 percent equity interest in Assured Guaranty which was valued at $530 million at December 31, 2004 and our 22.1 percent joint venture in Huatai – our carrying value for this investment is approximately $147 million. The increase of $5 billion in total investments is due to positive cash flows from operations as a result of strong premium volume over the last several years. The increase in total investments was partially offset by a decline in invested assets of $1.8 billion, due to the sale of Assured Guaranty. The following tables show the market value of our fixed maturities, short-term investments and securities on loan at December 31, 2004 and 2003. The first table lists elements according to type, and the second according to S&P credit rating.

At December 31, 2004, our fixed income investment portfolio included below-investment grade and non-rated securities which, in total, comprised approximately seven percent of our fixed income portfolio. At December 31, 2003, eight percent of our fixed income portfolio was made up of below-investment grade and non-rated securities. We define a security as being below-investment grade if it has an S&P credit rating of BB or less. Our below investment-grade and non-rated portfolio includes approximately 750 issues, with the top 15 holdings making up approximately 12 percent of the $1.9 billion balance at December 31, 2004. The highest single exposure in this portfolio of securities is $18 million. Below-investment grade securities have different characteristics than investment grade corporate debt securities. Risk of loss from default by the borrower is greater with below-investment grade securities. Below-investment grade securities are generally unsecured and are often subordinated to other creditors of the issuer. Also, issuers of below-investment grade securities usually have higher levels of debt and are more sensitive to adverse economic conditions such as recession or increasing interest rates, than are investment grade issuers. We reduce the overall risk in the below-investment grade portfolio, as in all investments, through careful credit analysis, strict investment policy guidelines, and diversification by issuer and/or guarantor as well as by industry. Restricted Assets We are required to maintain assets on deposit with various regulatory authorities to support our insurance and reinsurance operations. These requirements are generally promulgated in the statutory regulations of the individual jurisdictions. The assets on deposit are available to settle insurance and reinsurance liabilities. We also utilize trust funds in certain large transactions where the trust funds are set up for the benefit of the ceding companies and generally take the place of Letter of Credit (LOC) requirements. We also have investments in segregated portfolios primarily to provide collateral or guarantees for LOCs and debt instruments. (See Notes 8 and 9 of the Consolidated Financial Statements) The following table identifies the value of restricted assets at December 31, 2004 and 2003. (in millions of U.S. dollars) 2004 2003 Deposits with U.S. regulatory authorities $ 857 $ 908 Deposits with non-U.S. regulatory authorities 1,866 1,303 Assets used for collateral or guarantees 894 1,141 Trust funds 1,778 1,707 $ 5,395 $ 5,059 Deposits with non-U.S. regulatory authorities increased 43 percent in 2004, compared with 2003, due to higher asset balances in support of our Lloyd’s Syndicate 2488. All syndicate assets are restricted under Lloyd’s Trust Deeds. Assets used for collateral or guarantees decreased 22 percent, primarily due to the sale of Assured Guaranty, combined with decreased use of our secured credit facility. The impact of the sale of Assured Guaranty on the trust funds balance was offset by increased asset balances to support growth at ACE Tempest Re USA. 57 Table of Contents Unpaid Losses and Loss Expenses We establish reserves for the estimated unpaid ultimate liability for losses and loss expenses under the terms of our policies and agreements. These reserves take into account estimates both for claims that have been reported and for IBNR, and include estimates of expenses associated with processing and settling claims. The table below presents a rollforward of our unpaid losses and loss expenses for the year ended December 31, 2004. (in millions of U.S. dollars) Gross Losses ReinsuranceRecoverable Net Losses Balance at December 31, 2003 $ 27,155 $ 13,192 $ 13,963 Losses and loss expenses incurred 11,750 4,036 7,714 Losses and loss expenses paid (7,871 ) (3,460 ) (4,411 ) Sale of Assured Guaranty (477 ) (103 ) (374 ) Other (including foreign exchange revaluation) 956 672 284 Balance at December 31, 2004 $ 31,513 $ 14,337 $ 17,176 The process of establishing reserves for claims can be complex and is subject to considerable variability as it requires the use of informed estimates and judgments. Our estimates and judgments may be revised as additional experience and other data become available and are reviewed; as new or improved methodologies are developed; or as current laws change. We do not discount our loss reserves, except for net loss and loss expense reserves of $157 million representing structured settlements for which the timing and amount of future claim payments are reliably determinable. The following table shows our total reserves segregated between case reserves and IBNR reserves.

Specialty includes aviation, satellite, marine, A&H, political risk and personal lines of business. The following table shows these components at December 31, 2004. (in millions of U.S. dollars) Gross Ceded Net Long-tail Case reserves $ 8,716 $ 3,720 $ 4,996 Expenses 2,171 1,212 959 IBNR 14,038 7,297 6,741 Subtotal 24,925 12,229 12,696 Short-tail Case reserves 2,119 647 1,472 Expenses 139 19 120 IBNR 1,386 516 870 Subtotal 3,644 1,182 2,462 Specialty Case reserves 1,601 486 1,115 Expenses 81 (11 ) 92 IBNR 1,262 451 811 Subtotal 2,944 926 2,018 Total Case reserves 12,436 4,853 7,583 Expenses 2,391 1,220 1,171 IBNR 16,686 8,264 8,422 Subtotal $ 31,513 $ 14,337 $ 17,176 We continually evaluate our reserve estimates taking into account new information and discussion and negotiation with our insureds. We estimate the ultimate loss amounts by projecting losses as of the valuation date using loss development patterns derived from historical data. In addition, a tail factor is applied to the projected loss amount to reflect further potential development beyond the period of historical record. While we believe our reserve for unpaid losses and loss expenses at December 31, 2004 is adequate, new information or trends, such as judicial action broadening the scope of coverage or expanding liability, may lead to future developments in ultimate losses and loss expenses significantly greater or less than the reserve provided, which could have a material adverse effect on future operating results. Particularly significant variables for which a change in assumption could have a material effect on unpaid losses and loss expenses include, but are not limited to, the following: Insurance – North American Segment Given the long reporting and paid development pattern, the tail factors used to project actual current losses to ultimate losses for claims covered by our middle market workers’ compensation policies require considerable judgment that could be material to consolidated losses and loss expense reserves. Specifically, a one percent change in the tail factor could cause approximately a $45 million change, either positively or negatively, for the selected net loss and loss expense ultimate for that segment. We believe that our selected tail factors represent the most likely loss development based on historical loss payment patterns of this and other comparable long-tail lines of business as well as the current legal and economic environment. The actual tail factor could vary by several percentage points from the tail factor selected. Because tail factors are stated in terms of decimals (e.g., 1.125) and often, the actuary’s choice regarding reasonably supportable tail factors range within percentages of each other, the realistic change in tail factors can be expressed in percentage points. Our ACE Bermuda operations write predominantly high excess of loss claims made professional liability business typically with attachment points in excess of $100 million. Claims development for this business can vary significantly for individual claims and historically could vary by as much as $50 million per claim depending on the nature of the loss. 59 Table of Contents Insurance – Overseas General Certain international long tail lines, such as casualty and professional lines, are particularly susceptible to changes in loss trend and claim inflation. Heightened perceptions of tort and settlement awards around the world are increasing the demand for these products as well as contributing to the uncertainty of the reserving estimates. Our reserving methods rely heavily on loss development patterns estimated from historical data and while we attempt to adjust such factors for known changes in the current tort environment, it is possible that such factors may not entirely reflect all recent trends in tort environments. For example, a three month delay of our selected loss development patterns could increase reserve estimates on long tail casualty and professional lines by approximately $65 million. Global Reinsurance Typically there is inherent uncertainty around the length of paid and reporting development patterns, especially for certain casualty lines such as excess workers’ compensation or general liability, which may take up to 30 years to fully develop. This uncertainty is accentuated by the need to supplement client development patterns with industry development patterns as justified by the credibility of the data. The underlying source and selection of the final development pattern can thus have a significant impact on the selected net loss and loss expense ultimate. For example, a 10 percent slowing or quickening of the development pattern for certain long-tail lines could cause the ultimate loss derived by the reported Bornhuetter-Ferguson method to increase by as much as three percent, or $30 million. Assumed Reinsurance At December 31, 2004, net unpaid losses and loss expenses for the Global Reinsurance segment aggregated to $1.5 billion, consisting of $400 million of case reserves and $1.1 billion of IBNR. Prior to 2000, our reinsurance operations had been concentrated in the property catastrophe reinsurance market. For catastrophe business, we principally estimate unpaid losses and loss expenses on an event basis by considering various sources of information including specific loss estimates reported by our cedants, ceding company and overall industry loss estimates reported by our brokers, and our internal data regarding reinsured exposures related to the geographical location of the event. The latter internal analysis enables us to establish catastrophe reserves for known events with more certainty at an earlier date than would be the case if we solely relied on reports from third parties to determine carried reserves. In 2000, we began writing casualty lines of reinsurance in the United States, and to a lesser extent, Europe, Asia, and Australia. Given the long-tail nature of this business, these new lines have both increased the amount of reserves in the Global Reinsurance segment as well as the uncertainty in the loss estimation process. For our casualty reinsurance business, we generally rely on ceding companies to report claims and then use that data as a key input to estimate unpaid losses and loss expenses. Due to the reliance on claims information reported by ceding companies, as well as other factors, the estimation of unpaid losses and loss expenses for assumed reinsurance includes certain risks and uncertainties that are unique relative to our direct insurance business. These include, but are not necessarily limited to, the following: • The reported claims information could be inaccurate. • Typically, a lag exists between the reporting of a loss event to a ceding company and its reporting to us as a reinsurance claim. The use of a broker to transmit financial information from a ceding company to us increases the reporting lag. Because most of our reinsurance business is produced by brokers, ceding companies generally first submit claim and other financial information to brokers, who then report the proportionate share of such information to each reinsurer of a particular treaty. The reporting lag generally results in a longer period of time between the date a claim is incurred and the date a claim is reported compared with direct insurance operations. Therefore, the risk of delayed recognition of loss reserve development is higher for assumed reinsurance than for direct insurance lines. • The historical claims data for a particular reinsurance agreement can be limited relative to our insurance business in that there may be less historical information available. Additionally, for many coverages, such as excess of loss contracts, there may be relatively few expected claims in a particular year so the actual number of claims may be susceptible to significant variability. In such cases, the actuary often relies on industry data from several recognized sources. We mitigate the above risks in several ways. In addition to routine analytical reviews of ceding company reports to ensure reported claims information appears reasonable, we perform regular underwriting and claims audits of certain ceding companies to ensure reported claims information is accurate, complete, and timely. As appropriate, audit findings are used to adjust claims in the reserving process. We also use our knowledge of the historical development of losses from individual ceding companies to adjust the level of adequacy we believe exists in the reported ceded losses. 60 Table of Contents On occasion, there will be differences between our carried loss reserves and unearned premium reserves and the amount of loss reserves and unearned premium reserves recorded at ceding companies. This is due to the fact that we only receive consistent and timely information from ceding companies with respect to case reserves. For IBNR, we use historical experience and other statistical information, depending on the type of business, to estimate the ultimate loss (see Unpaid Losses and Loss Expenses for more information). We estimate our unearned premium reserve by applying estimated earning patterns to net premiums written for each treaty based upon that treaty’s coverage basis (i.e. risks attaching or losses occurring). At December 31, 2004, the case reserves reported to us by our ceding companies were $394 million, compared with the $408 million we recorded. We do, on occasion, post additional case reserves in addition to the amounts reported by our cedants when our evaluation of the ultimate value of a reported claim is different than the evaluation of that claim by our cedant. Within the Insurance – North American segment, we also have exposure to certain liability reinsurance lines that have been in run-off since 1994. Unpaid losses and loss expenses relating to this run-off reinsurance business resides within the Brandywine Division of our Insurance – North American segment. Most of the remaining unpaid losses and loss expense reserves for the run-off reinsurance business relate to asbestos and environmental claims. (See section entitled “Asbestos and Environmental Claims” for more information) Asbestos and Environmental and Other Run-off Liabilities Included in our liabilities for losses and loss expenses are amounts for asbestos, environmental and latent injury damage claims and expenses (A&E). These A&E liabilities principally relate to claims arising from remediation costs associated with hazardous waste sites and bodily-injury claims related to asbestos products and environmental hazards. The estimation of these liabilities is particularly sensitive to the recent legal environment, including specific settlements that may be used as precedents to settle future claims. These liabilities include provision for both reported and IBNR claims. The table below presents a roll forward of our selected loss reserve data for A&E exposures, excluding the provision for bad debts, for the year ended December 31, 2004.

Our exposure to A&E claims principally arises out of liabilities acquired when we purchased Westchester Specialty in 1998 and the P&C business of CIGNA in 1999, with the larger exposure contained within the liabilities acquired in the CIGNA transaction. In 1996, prior to our acquisition of the P&C business of CIGNA, the Pennsylvania Insurance Commissioner approved a plan to restructure INA Financial Corporation and its subsidiaries (the “Restructuring”) which included the division of Insurance Company of North America (INA) into two separate corporations: (1) an active insurance company that retained the INA name and continued to write P&C business and (2) an inactive run-off company, now called Century Indemnity Company (Century). As a result of the division, the A&E liabilities of INA were allocated to Century and extinguished, as a matter of Pennsylvania law, as liabilities of INA. As part of the Restructuring, the A&E liabilities of various U.S. affiliates of INA were reinsured to Century, and Century and certain other run-off companies housing A&E liabilities were contributed to Brandywine Holdings Corporation (Brandywine Holdings). As part of the 1999 acquisition of the P&C business of CIGNA, we acquired Brandywine Holdings and its various subsidiaries. During the second half of 2004, we conducted an internal, ground-up review of our consolidated A&E liabilities. During this same period, a team of external actuaries performed an evaluation as to the adequacy of the reserves of Century and its two U.S. insurance subsidiaries, ACE American Reinsurance Company (ACE American Re), and Century Reinsurance Company (Century Re), both Pennsylvania insurers. The external review was conducted in accordance with the Brandywine restructuring order, which requires that an external actuarial review of Century’s reserves be completed every two years. 61 Table of Contents In January 2005, we announced net additions to our A&E and other run-off reserves of $364 million exclusive of the provision for bad debts of $95 million. The net additions comprised A&E reserve increases of $453 million and favorable prior period development of $89 million in other run-off reserves. In addition, ACE Overseas General had gross and net A&E additions of $6 million resulting in a total A&E charge of $459 million for 2004. Our A&E reserves are not discounted and do not reflect any anticipated changes in the legal, social or economic environment, or any benefit from future legislative reforms. Accordingly, our A&E reserves make no allowance for future state or federal asbestos reforms, such as those currently being contemplated. The majority of our reserve increase in the fourth quarter of 2004 arose with the strengthening of a core group of major accounts impacted by changes in the asbestos industry landscape. In particular, our estimates of future liability were impacted by the continued negative effect of bankruptcies and an increase in defense costs to litigate cases. In 2004, the pre-tax gross reserve increase related to the Brandywine operations was $788 million and $339 million net of reinsurance. The Brandywine reserve increase related not only to A&E exposures but also to other run-off exposures included in the Brandywine operations. These other run-off exposures increased pre-tax gross reserves by $68 million while reducing net reserves by $89 million primarily due to favorable development in ceded IBNR in these other exposures. For Westchester Specialty, the A&E pre-tax gross reserve increase was $385 million and $25 million net of reinsurance. In the January 2005 announcement the gross reserve increase in A&E was net of favorable gross reserve development in other run-off exposures at Westchester Specialty of $180 million. ACE Overseas General also had an A&E pre-tax reserve increase of $6 million gross and net of reinsurance. In 2003, there were no losses and loss expenses incurred for A&E. Paid losses for asbestos claims were $293 million on gross reserves and $169 million on net reserves. Environmental and other latent exposure claim payments were $204 million on gross reserves and $153 million on net reserves. For GAAP purposes, our A&E loss reserves are held at nominal value (i.e., they are not discounted despite the long-term nature of liabilities). Reserving Considerations For asbestos, we face claims relating to policies issued covering product manufacturers, distributors, installers and other parties in the chain of commerce for asbestos and products containing asbestos. Claims can be filed by individual claimants or group of claimants with the potential for hundreds of individual claimants at one time. Claimants will generally allege damages across an extended time period which may coincide with multiple policies for a single insured. For asbestos, our internal definition of a count is a policyholder asbestos cause of action. For example, an asbestos manufacturer who faces products liability claims alleging bodily injury from exposure to their product would generate one count regardless of the number of policies we may have issued or the actual numbers of underlying claimants alleging damages. If however, the policyholder were to face claims arising under both an asbestos exposure and a combined silica and asbestos (mixed dust) exposure, each of these caustive agents for that policyholder would generate a separate count. The table below summarizes count information for asbestos, environmental and long-term exposure (LTE) claims for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, for direct policies only, and excludes claims from assumed reinsurance. 2004 2003 Asbestos (by causative agent) Open at the beginning of year 1,318 1,042 Newly reported 190 320 Closed or otherwise disposed 134 44 Open at end of year 1,374 1,318 Environmental (by site) Open at the beginning of year 8,588 9,145 Newly reported 549 720 Closed or otherwise disposed 1,965 1,277 Open at end of year 7,172 8,588 LTE (by caustive agent) Open at the beginning of year 927 915 Newly reported 233 212 Closed or otherwise disposed 240 200 Open at end of year 920 927 62 Table of Contents The total pending counts for asbestos at December 31, 2004 are 1,374 as shown in the table above. In our January 6, 2005 disclosure on asbestos, we included a table that showed a total of 1,276 direct policyholders. The differences between the two numbers are as follows: • The prior disclosure counted each policyholder only once regardless of whether there are multiple asbestos causes of action. • The first category in that prior disclosure, 60 major asbestos manufacturers/producers, included closed accounts as well as a few accounts where ACE never had exposure. • The table above reflects all of our U.S. based direct exposure. Policies issued by the Westchester Specialty operations are included above in addition to exposures under direct policies that are liabilities of the Brandywine operations. In our prior disclosure the claim count related soley to Brandywine. For environmental, we face exposure for remediation costs and defense associated with property damage as a result of pollution. It is common, especially for larger defendants, to be named as a potentially responsible party (PRP) at multiple sites. Our count definition in the table above is based on policyholder by site numbers. For example, if a policyholder is named as a PRP at ten sites it would generate ten counts. In addition, should we have multiple policyholders identified as PRP’s at the same waste site, each would generate a count. In 2004, the number of newly reported sites for environmental has continued the downward decline experienced in recent years. The number of new sites in 2004 was 549, representing a decline of 23.8 percent over the 720 new sites reported in 2003. Closed site counts increased in the same time period from 1,277 in 2003 to 1,965 in 2004. The net result of this decline in new reports and increase in closings is a 16.5 percent decline in open counts at December 31, 2004 versus the year prior. Long-term exposure cases represent a collection of latent claims each with the potential for a large number of claimants. The exposures range from silica to silicon breast implants to lead and other chemical exposures. Our definition of a count is similar to asbestos. A policyholder will generate one count for each causative agent regardless of the number of policies or claimants alleging injury. In 2004, the number of newly reported asbestos counts declined to 190 versus 320 new claims in 2003. As we note elsewhere in this filing, the fourth quarter charge for asbestos was primarily a result of increases in costs for a small number of major asbestos defendants and to a lesser extent newly reported counts. Reinsurance and Other Considerations relating to ACE’s Ultimate A&E and other Run-off Exposures Westchester Specialty As part of the acquisition of Westchester Specialty, National Indemnity Company (NICO) provided a 75 percent pro-rata share of $1 billion of reinsurance protection for adverse development on loss and loss adjustment expense reserves. At December 31, 2004, the remaining unused limit under this NICO Westchester Specialty cover was $515.8 million. Brandywine Run-off Entities As part of the acquisition of the CIGNA P&C business, NICO provided $2.5 billion of reinsurance protection to Century on all Brandywine loss and loss adjustment expense reserves and on the A&E reserves of various ACE INA insurance subsidiaries reinsured by Century (in each case, including uncollectible reinsurance). The benefits of this NICO agreement (the “Brandywine NICO Agreement”) flow to the other Brandywine companies and to the ACE INA insurance subsidiaries through reinsurance agreements between those companies and Century. The Brandywine NICO Agreement was exhausted on an incurred basis with the increase in the A&E reserves in the fourth quarter of 2002. In addition to housing a significant portion of our A&E exposure, the Brandywine operations include run-off liabilities related to various insurance and reinsurance businesses. The following companies comprise ACE’s Brandywine operations: Century, a Pennsylvania insurer, Century Re, ACE American Re, Brandywine Reinsurance Company S.A.-N.V., a Belgium insurer (Brandywine SANV), Century International Reinsurance Company Ltd., a Bermuda insurer (CIRC), and Brandywine Reinsurance Company (UK) Ltd., a U.K. insurer (BRUK). All of the Brandywine companies are direct or indirect subsidiaries of Brandywine Holdings except for BRUK, which is a direct subsidiary of ACE INA International Holdings, Ltd. (ACE INA International Holdings). BRUK’s liabilities have been ceded to Century through CIRC. The U.S.-based ACE INA companies assumed two contractual obligations in respect of the Brandywine operations in connection with the Restructuring: a dividend retention fund obligation and a surplus maintenance obligation in the form of an aggregate excess of loss reinsurance agreement. In accordance with the Brandywine restructuring order, INA Financial Corporation established and funded a dividend retention fund (the “Dividend Retention Fund”) consisting of $50 million plus investment earnings. The full balance of the Dividend Retention Fund was contributed to Century as of 63 Table of Contents December 31, 2002. To the extent future dividends are paid by INA Holdings Corporation to its parent, INA Financial Corporation, and to the extent INA Financial Corporation then pays such dividends to INA Corporation, a portion of those dividends must be withheld to replenish the principal of the Dividend Retention Fund to $50 million within five years. In 2004 and 2003, no such dividends were paid, and therefore no replenishment of the Dividend Retention Fund occurred. The obligation to maintain and to replenish the Dividend Retention Fund as necessary and to the extent dividends are paid is ongoing until ACE INA receives prior written approval from the Pennsylvania Insurance Commissioner to terminate the fund. In addition, the ACE INA insurance subsidiaries are obligated to provide insurance coverage to Century in the amount of $800 million under an aggregate excess of loss reinsurance agreement (the “Aggregate Excess of Loss Agreement”) if the statutory capital and surplus of Century falls below $25 million or if Century lacks liquid assets with which to pay claims as they become due, after giving effect to the contribution of the balance, if any, of the Dividend Retention Fund. Coverage under the Aggregate Excess of Loss Agreement was triggered as of December 31, 2002 following contribution of the balance of the Dividend Retention Fund, because Century’s capital and surplus fell below $25 million at December 31, 2002. Effective December 31, 2004, ACE INA Holdings contributed $100 million to Century in exchange for a surplus note. After giving effect to the contribution and issuance of the surplus note, the statutory surplus of Century at December 31, 2004 was $25 million and approximately $458 million in statutory-basis losses were ceded to the Aggregate Excess of Loss Agreement. Century reports the amount ceded under the Aggregate Excess of Loss Agreement in accordance with statutory accounting principles, which differ from GAAP by, among other things, allowing Century to discount its asbestos and environmental reserves. For GAAP reporting purposes, intercompany reinsurance recoverables related to the Aggregate Excess of Loss Agreement are eliminated in consolidation. To estimate ACE’s remaining claim exposure under the Aggregate Excess of Loss Agreement under GAAP, we adjust the statutory cession to exclude the discount embedded in statutory loss reserves. At December 31, 2004, approximately $769 million in GAAP basis losses were ceded under the Aggregate Excess of Loss Agreement, leaving a remaining limit of coverage under that agreement of approximately $31 million. If the limit of coverage were to be exhausted, ACE’s results would nevertheless continue to recognize losses arising from any adverse loss reserve development of the Brandywine entities for so long as those companies remain consolidated subsidiaries of ACE. Uncertainties Relating to ACE’s Ultimate Brandywine Exposure In addition to the Dividend Retention Fund and Aggregate Excess of Loss Agreement commitments described above, certain ACE entities are primarily liable for asbestos, environmental and other exposures that they have reinsured to Century. Accordingly, if Century were to become insolvent and ACE were to lose control of Century, some or all of the recoverables due to these ACE companies from Century could become uncollectible, yet those ACE entities would continue to be responsible to pay claims to their insureds or reinsureds. Under such circumstances, ACE would recognize a loss in its consolidated statement of operations. As of December 31, 2004, the aggregate reinsurance balances ceded by the active ACE companies to Century were $1.58 billion. At December 31, 2004, Century’s carried reserves (including reserves ceded by the active ACE companies to Century) were $5.1 billion. We believe the intercompany reinsurance recoverables, which relate to liabilities payable over many years (i.e., 25 years or more), are not impaired at this time. The liabilities ceded to Century by its affiliates have in turn been ceded by Century to NICO and, as of December 31, 2004, approximately $2 billion of cover remains on a paid basis. As a result, any economic exposure there may be to adverse developments in the future is substantially less than the nominal value of the reinsurance recoverables. The impact of the transaction described below would reduce the balance due from Century to active ACE Companies by $90 million. Should Century’s loss reserves experience adverse development in the future and should Century be placed into rehabilitation or liquidation, the reinsurance recoverables due to Century’s affiliates would be payable only after the payment in full of all administrative expenses and direct policy liabilities. Thus, the intercompany reinsurance recoverables would be at risk to the extent of the shortage of assets remaining to pay these recoverables. As of December 31, 2004, reserves ceded by Century to the active ACE companies and other amounts owed to Century by the ACE active companies were $930 million in the aggregate. In a lawsuit filed in California state court in December 1999 (AICCO, Inc v. Insurance Company of North America, et al.) certain competitors of ACE USA challenged the validity of the Restructuring under California’s Unfair Competition Law, Business and Professions Code Section 17200 (UCL). The lawsuit claims that the Restructuring is not applicable to California policyholders under the UCL because it constituted a transfer of liabilities without the consent of the policyholders. The suit also claims that the notice of the Restructuring was misleading. In November 2004, the voters of California approved Proposition 64 amending the UCL by, inter alia, requiring that lawsuits brought under the UCL be brought by plaintiffs who have suffered actual injury as a result of the challenged business practice. In response to a motion to dismiss brought by ACE USA, the court ruled in February 2005 that the competitors/plaintiffs who brought this 64 Table of Contents suit have not alleged actual injury as required by Proposition 64 and dismissed the suit. The time for appeal has not yet run and it is possible that the plaintiffs will appeal the ruling. Pending Sale of Certain Brandywine Companies Closing of the sale is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including without limitation the obtaining of all necessary consents and approvals from third parties, including the Pennsylvania Insurance Department and the Financial Services Authority of the United Kingdom, and the commutation of certain affiliate reinsurance agreements. In connection with certain of these commutations, Century’s assumed loss reserves would be reduced and an associated amount of coverage would become available under the Aggregate Excess of Loss Agreement. We are pursuing potential options for the disposition of other Brandywine entities, including a possible sale of Century. There can be no assurance that any such sale or other disposition will be consummated. Legislative Initiatives Congress has been working on possible legislation to move all U.S. asbestos bodily-injury claims to a federal trust for compensation in accordance with an established set of medical criteria and claim values. The trust would be funded by asbestos defendants and their insurers. As currently proposed, ACE would be one of the insurer participants. However, we cannot predict if any such proposed legislation will be modified or adopted. Reinsurance One of the ways we manage our loss exposure is through the use of reinsurance. While reinsurance agreements are designed to limit our losses from large exposures and permit recovery of a portion of direct unpaid losses, reinsurance does not relieve us of our liability to our insureds. Accordingly, the losses and loss expense reserves on our balance sheet represent our total unpaid gross losses. The reinsurance recoverable represents anticipated recoveries of a portion of those gross unpaid losses as well as amounts recoverable from reinsurers with respect to claims paid. The table below presents our net reinsurance recoverable at December 31, 2004 and 2003. December 31 (in millions of U.S. dollars) 2004 2003 Reinsurance recoverable on paid losses and loss expenses $ 1,211 1,277 Bad debt reserve on paid losses and loss expenses (309 ) (403 ) Reinsurance recoverable on future policy benefits 15 15 Reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses and loss expenses 14,956 13,749 Bad debt reserve on unpaid losses and loss expenses (619 ) (557 ) Net reinsurance recoverable $ 15,254 $ 14,081 Our reinsurance recoverable and bad debt reserve on paid losses and loss expense decreased in 2004, compared with 2003, primarily due to our decision to write-off reinsurance recoverable balances (and associated bad debt reserves) which we believe to be uncollectible. This action had no significant impact on our net income. Reinsurance recoverable and bad debt reserve on unpaid losses and loss expenses increased in 2004, primarily due to the A&E reserve strengthening, increased catastrophe losses and also due to foreign exchange revaluations due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar. For more information see Note 7 of our Consolidated Financial Statements. 65 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity Liquidity is a measure of a company’s ability to generate cash flows sufficient to meet short-term and long-term cash requirements of its business operations. As a holding company, ACE possesses assets that consist primarily of the stock of its subsidiaries, and of other investments. In addition to net investment income, our cash flows currently depend primarily on dividends or other statutorily permissible payments. Historically, these dividends and other payments have come from our Bermuda-based operating subsidiaries, which we refer to as our Bermuda subsidiaries. As an insurance company, one of our principal responsibilities to our clients is to ensure that we have ready access to funds to settle large unforeseen claims. Given anticipated growth in premiums and a lengthening of the average duration of our claim liabilities due to a higher proportionate growth in long-tail relative to short-tail business, we expect that positive cash flow from operations (underwriting activities and investment income) will be sufficient to cover cash outflows under most loss scenarios through 2005. To further ensure the sufficiency of funds to settle unforeseen claims, we hold a certain amount of invested assets in cash and short-term investments and maintain available credit facilities. In addition, for certain insurance, reinsurance, or deposit contracts that tend to have relatively large and reasonably predictable cash outflows, such as loss portfolio contracts, we attempt to establish dedicated portfolios of assets that are duration-matched with the related liabilities. With respect to the duration of our overall investment portfolio, we manage asset durations to both maximize return given current market conditions and provide sufficient liquidity to cover future loss payments. In a low rate environment, the overall duration of our fixed maturity investments tends to be shorter and in a high rate environment, such durations tend to be longer. Given the current low rate environment, at December 31, 2004, the average duration of our fixed maturity investments (3.4 years) is less than the average expected duration of our insurance liabilities (4.1 years). Despite our safeguards, if paid losses accelerated beyond our ability to fund such paid losses from current operating cash flows, we might need to either liquidate a portion of our investment portfolio or arrange for financing. Potential events causing such a liquidity strain could be several significant catastrophes occurring in a relatively short period of time or large scale uncollectible reinsurance recoverables on paid losses (as a result of coverage disputes, reinsurers’ credit problems or decreases in the value of collateral supporting reinsurance recoverables). Additional strain on liquidity could occur if the investments sold to fund loss payments were sold at depressed prices. Because each subsidiary focuses on a more limited number of specific product lines than is collectively available from the ACE group of companies, the mix of business tends to be less diverse at the subsidiary level. As a result, the probability of a liquidity strain, as described above, may be greater for individual subsidiaries than when liquidity is assessed on a consolidated basis. If such a liquidity strain were to occur in a subsidiary, we may be required to contribute capital to the particular subsidiary and/or curtail dividends from the subsidiary to support holding company operations. With respect to the catastrophe losses during 2004, we anticipate all loss payments will be funded in the ordinary course of business due to positive operating cash flow combined with adequate balances of cash and short-term investments. The payments of dividends or other statutorily permissible distributions from our operating companies are subject to the laws and regulations applicable to each jurisdiction, as well as the need to maintain capital levels adequate to support the insurance and reinsurance operations, including financial strength ratings issued by independent rating agencies, which are discussed below. During 2004, we were able to meet all of our obligations, including the payment of dividends declared on our Ordinary Shares and Preferred Shares, with our net cash flow and dividends received. Should the need arise, we generally have access to the debt markets and other available credit facilities that are discussed below. We assess which subsidiaries to draw dividends from based on a number of factors. Considerations such as regulatory and legal restrictions as well as the subsidiary’s financial condition are paramount to the dividend decision. The legal restrictions on the payment of dividends from retained earnings by our Bermuda subsidiaries are currently satisfied by the share capital and additional paid-in capital of each of the Bermuda subsidiaries. During 2004, ACE Bermuda and ACE Tempest Life Reinsurance Ltd declared and paid dividends of $227 million and $259 million, respectively. During 2003, ACE Bermuda declared and paid dividends of $478 million, and ACE Cap Re International Ltd. declared and paid dividends of $25 million. We expect that a majority of our cash inflows for 2005 will be from our Bermuda subsidiaries. The payment of any dividends from ACE Global Markets or its subsidiaries would be subject to applicable U.K. insurance laws and regulations including those promulgated by the Society of Lloyd’s. ACE INA’s U.S. insurance subsidiaries may pay dividends, without prior regulatory approval, only from earned surplus and subject to certain annual limitations 66 Table of Contents and the maintenance of a minimum capital requirement. ACE INA’s international subsidiaries are also subject to insurance laws and regulations particular to the countries in which the subsidiaries operate. These laws and regulations include restrictions that limit the amount of dividends payable without prior approval of regulatory insurance authorities. We did not receive any dividends from ACE Global Markets or ACE INA in 2004 or 2003. Under the Lloyd’s accounting model, syndicates in Lloyd’s operate each year as an annual venture. Each year of account is held open for three years. At the end of three years, the year of account purchases reinsurance from the next open year, which is known as reinsurance to close or RITC, and distributes the remaining funds to the investors in the syndicate. ACE Global Markets has historically retained these funds for operational purposes. ACE INA issued debt to provide partial financing for the ACE INA acquisition and for other operating needs. This debt is serviced by dividends paid by ACE INA’s insurance subsidiaries to ACE INA as well as other group resources. Our sale of 65.3 percent of the common shares of Assured Guaranty in the second quarter generated proceeds, net of offering costs, of approximately $835 million and a return of capital of $200 million from Assured Guaranty, which were used to support our P&C business and strengthen our balance sheet capital position. Our consolidated sources of funds consist primarily of net premiums written, net investment income and proceeds from sales and maturities of investments. Funds are used primarily to pay claims, operating expenses, dividends and for the purchase of investments. After satisfying our cash requirements, excess cash flows from these underwriting and investing activities are invested. Our insurance and reinsurance operations provide liquidity in that premiums are received in advance, sometimes substantially in advance, of the time claims are paid. Generally cash flows are affected by claim payments that, due to the nature of our operations, may comprise large loss payments on a limited number of claims and which can fluctuate significantly from year to year. The irregular timing of these loss payments can create significant variations in cash flows from operations between periods. Refer to the section entitled, “Contractual Obligations and Commitments” for our estimate of future claim payments by period. Sources of liquidity include cash from operations, financing arrangements or routine sales of investments. • Our consolidated net cash flows from operating activities were $5 billion in 2004, compared with $4.2 billion in 2003 and $2.4 billion in 2002. These amounts reflect net income for each year, adjusted for non-cash items and changes in working capital. Despite lower net income in 2004, net cash flows from operating activities increased, primarily due to an increase in net unpaid losses and loss expenses, compared with 2003. The increase in net cash flows from operating activities in 2003, compared with 2002, was primarily driven by higher net income and net unpaid losses and loss expenses, partially offset by lower unearned premiums. Typically, the adjustments to net income reflect the fact that there is a significant period of time between the recording of a loss (ranging up to several years or more) and the actual claim payment. • Our consolidated net cash flows used for investing activities increased to $4.8 billion in 2004, and was net of $958 million received from the sale of Assured Guaranty (net of cash sold). This compares with net cash flows used for investing activities of $4.7 billion and $1.9 billion in 2003 and 2002, respectively. These increases reflect our strong consolidated net cash flows from operating activities. Net purchases of fixed maturities were $5 billion in 2004, compared with $4.9 billion and $2 billion in 2003 and 2002, respectively. • Our consolidated net cash flows used for financing activities were $155 million in 2004. This compares with net cash flows from financing activities of $395 million in 2003 and net cash flows used for financing activities of $491 million in 2002. Net cash flow usage for 2004 was related to increased dividends paid, partially offset by an increase in proceeds from exercise of options. The 2004 year also included net proceeds of $500 million from our debt issuance, which was partially offset by the repayment of debt and trust preferred securities of $475 million. The 2003 year included net proceeds of $557 million from our Preferred Share issuance. Net cash flows used for financing activities in 2002 were primarily driven by the repayment of $400 million of trust preferred securities. Although our ongoing operations continue to generate positive cash flows, our cash flows are currently impacted by a large book of loss reserves from businesses in run-off. The run-off operations generated negative operating cash flows of $88 million in 2004, compared with $645 million and $525 million in 2003 and 2002, respectively, primarily due to claim payments. The decrease in negative operating cash flows for 2004 relates primarily to funds received under the NICO agreement of $402 million. Both internal and external forces influence our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Claim settlements, premium levels and investment returns may be impacted by changing rates of inflation and other economic conditions. In many cases, significant periods of time, ranging up to several years or more, may lapse between the occurrence 67 Table of Contents of an insured loss, the reporting of the loss to us and the settlement of the liability for that loss. We believe that our cash balances, cash flow from operations, routine sales of investments and the liquidity provided by our credit facilities, as discussed below are adequate to meet expected cash requirements. ACE and its subsidiaries are assigned debt and financial strength (insurance) ratings from internationally recognized rating agencies, including S&P, A.M. Best, Moody’s Investors Service and Fitch IBCA. The ratings issued on our companies by these agencies are announced publicly and are available directly from the agencies. Our website, acelimited.com, also contains some information about our ratings, which can be found under the “Investor Information” tab. Financial strength ratings represent the opinions of the rating agencies on the financial strength of a company and its capacity to meet the obligations of insurance policies. Independent ratings are one of the important factors that establish our competitive position in the insurance markets. The rating agencies consider many factors in determining the financial strength rating of an insurance company, including the relative level of statutory surplus necessary to support the business operations of the company. These ratings are based upon factors relevant to policyholders, agents and intermediaries and are not directed toward the protection of investors. Such ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold securities. Debt ratings apply to short- and long-term debt as well as preferred stock. These ratings are assessments of the likelihood that we will make timely payments of principal and interest and preferred stock dividends. It is possible that, in the future, one or more of the rating agencies may reduce our existing ratings. If one or more of our ratings were downgraded, we could incur higher borrowing costs and our ability to access the capital markets could be impacted. In addition, our insurance and reinsurance operations could be adversely impacted by a downgrade in our financial strength ratings, including a possible reduction in demand for our products in certain markets. Capital Resources Capital resources consist of funds deployed or available to be deployed to support our business operations. The following table summarizes the components of our capital resources at December 31, 2004 and 2003. December 31 (in millions of U.S. dollars) 2004 2003 Short-term debt $ 146 $ 546 Long-term debt 1,849 1,349 Total debt 1,995 1,895 Trust preferred securities 412 475 Preferred shares 557 557 Ordinary shareholders’ equity 9,279 8,278 Total shareholders’ equity 9,836 8,835 Total capitalization $ 12,243 $ 11,205 Ratio of debt to total capitalization 16.3% 16.9% Ratio of debt plus trust preferreds to total capitalization 19.7% 21.2% We believe our financial strength provides us with the flexibility and capacity to obtain funds externally through debt or equity financing on both a short-term and long-term basis. Our ability to access the capital markets is dependent on, among other things, market conditions and our perceived financial strength. We have accessed both the debt and equity markets from time to time. As part of our capital management program, in November 2001, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of any ACE issued debt or capital securities including Ordinary Shares, up to $250 million. At December 31, 2004, this authorization had not been utilized. During 2004, we filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC relating to the issuance of up to $1.5 billion of certain types of debt and equity securities. This registration became effective during the first quarter of 2005. 68 Table of Contents Shareholders’ Equity The following table analyzes the movements in our shareholders’ equity for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002. (in millions of U.S. dollars) 2004 2003 2002 Balance, beginning of year $ 8,835 $ 6,389 $ 6,107 Net income 1,139 1,417 77 Change in net unrealized appreciation on investments, net of tax (49 ) 208 339 Dividends declared – Ordinary Shares (233 ) (204 ) (173 ) Dividends declared – Preferred Shares (45 ) (23 ) – Cumulative translation adjustments 94 108 (1 ) Other movements, net 95 82 66 Dividends declared – Mezzanine equity – (10 ) (26 ) Issuance of Preferred Shares – 557 – Conversion of Mezzanine equity – 311 – Balance, end of year $ 9,836 $ 8,835 $ 6,389 Our diluted book value per Ordinary Share increased to $32.48 at December 31, 2004, compared with $29.46 at December 31, 2003. In calculating our diluted book value per Ordinary Share, we include in-the-money options in the denominator. The expected proceeds from the in-the-money options are included in the numerator. Shareholders’ equity increased $1 billion in 2004, primarily due to net income of $1.1 billion, cumulative translation adjustments of $94 million and the exercise of options for Ordinary Shares of $83 million (included in “other movements, net”), partially offset by dividends declared of $278 million. Also included in “other movements, net”, are changes in the accumulated benefits obligation for certain of our foreign defined benefit plans. The change was an increase in 2004, primarily due to decreases in the discount rate assumed in each year compared with the prior year, partially offset by increases in the underlying investment portfolio at the end of each year. On January 14, 2004 and April 14, 2004, we paid dividends of 19 cents per Ordinary Share to shareholders of record on December 31, 2003 and March 31, 2004, respectively. On July 14, 2004, October 14, 2004, and January 14, 2005, we paid dividends of 21 cents per Ordinary Share to shareholders on record on June 30, 2004, September 30, 2004, and December 31, 2004, respectively. We have paid dividends each quarter since we became a public company in 1993. However, the declaration, payment and value of future dividends on Ordinary Shares is at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will be dependent upon our profits, financial requirements and other factors, including legal restrictions on the payment of dividends and such other factors as our Board of Directors deems relevant. Dividends on the Preferred Shares are payable quarterly, in arrears, when and if declared by our Board of Directors. In 2004, we paid dividends of $4.875 per Preferred Share (which translates to 48.75 cents per Depositary Share) on March 1, June 1, September 1, and December 1, to shareholders of record on February 29, May 31, August 31, and November 30, respectively. 69 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations and Commitments The table below shows our contractual obligations and commitments including our payments due by period at December 31, 2004: Payments Due By Period (in millions of U.S. dollars) Total Less than 1 Year 1-3 Years 4-5 Years After 5 Years Payment amounts determinable from the contract Deposit liabilities $ 343 $ 110 $ 98 $ 44 $ 91 Operating leases 386 72 97 71 146 Short-term debt 146 146 – – – Long-term debt 1,849 – 800 450 599 Trust preferred securities 412 – – – 412 Total obligations in which payment amounts are determinable from the contract 3,136 328 995 565 1,248 Payment amounts not determinable from the contract Estimated gross loss payments under insurance and reinsurance contracts 31,513 6,031 10,412 3,261 11,809 Total contractual obligations and commitments $ 34,649 $ 6,359 $ 11,407 $ 3,826 $ 13,057 The above table excludes pension obligations as minimum funding requirements are immaterial over the next year. Subsequent funding commitments are apt to vary for many factors and are difficult to estimate at this time. Deposit Liabilities Deposit liabilities of $343 million include reinsurance deposit liabilities of $238 million and contract holder deposit funds of $105 million. Contract holder deposit funds represent a liability for investment contracts sold that do not meet the definition of an insurance contract under FAS No. 97, “Accounting and Reporting by Insurance Enterprises for Certain Long-Duration Contracts and Realized Gains and Losses from the Sale of Investments”. The investment contracts are sold with a guaranteed rate of return. The proceeds are then invested with the intent of realizing a greater return than is called for in the investment contracts. Operating Lease Commitments We lease office space in most countries in which we operate under operating leases that expire at various dates through January 2018. We renew and enter into new leases in the ordinary course of business as required. Short-term Debt From time to time, we use securities repurchase agreements as a source of short-term liquidity. Under these repurchase agreements, we agree to sell securities and repurchase them at a future date for a predetermined price, thereby creating liquidity. The covenants of our existing credit facilities limit our borrowing under repurchase agreements to $800 million. At December 31, 2004, $146 million of reverse purchase agreements were outstanding. The proceeds were used to repay maturing commercial paper. Included in short-term debt for 2003 was ACE INA’s $400 million, 8.2 percent notes which became due on August 15, 2004. We repaid these notes in 2004. In June 1999, we arranged certain commercial paper programs. The programs use revolving credit facilities as back-up facilities and provide for up to $2.8 billion in commercial paper issuance (subject to the availability of back-up facilities, which currently total $600 million) for ACE and for ACE INA. 70 Table of Contents Long-term Debt Our total long-term debt of $1.8 billion is described in detail in Note 9 of our Consolidated Financial Statements. During 2004, we issued $500 million of ACE INA 5.875 percent senior notes due June 15, 2014. The proceeds of the notes were used, to repay $75 million of Capital Re trust preferred securities, $400 million of ACE INA 8.2 percent notes due in 2004, and for general corporate purposes. The following instruments have specific collateral triggers. In 1998, ACE US Holdings issued $250 million of unsecured senior notes that mature in October 2008. In December 1999, ACE INA issued $300 million of unsecured subordinated notes that mature in December 2009 – we repaid $100 million of this outstanding amount during 2002. We have a $450 million credit default swap in place that has the economic effect of reducing our cost of borrowing associated with these two issuances. The minimum collateral in connection with the credit default swap is $158 million. The actual collateral can be higher depending on the credit quality of securities pledged. Under these transactions, we would be required to provide collateral of $450 million if S&P downgraded our debt rating to BB+ or lower, or downgraded ACE Bermuda’s financial strength rating to BBB- or lower. Although there can be no assurance, we believe it is unlikely that either of these two events will occur. In the event that we terminate either of the swaps prematurely, we would be liable for certain transaction costs. The counter-party in each swap is a highly rated major financial institution and management does not anticipate non-performance. Trust Preferred Securities During 1999 and 2000, we issued $800 million of trust preferred securities. The funds generated from these issues were used to partially finance the ACE INA acquisition. In 2002, $400 million of the trust preferred securities matured and were repaid. In 2004, we repaid an additional $75 million (Capital Re trust preferred securities). The securities outstanding consist of $400 million of company-obligated mandatorily redeemable preferred shares ($100 million and $300 million) issued by two business trusts wholly owned by us. Each of the two remaining series of trust preferred securities was issued by a special purpose entity (two trusts) that is wholly owned by us. The sole assets of the special purpose entities are debt instruments issued by one or more of our subsidiaries. The special purpose entities look to payments on the debt instruments to make payments on the preferred securities. We have guaranteed the payments on these debt securities. The trustees of the trusts include one or more of our officers and at least one independent trustee, such as a trust company. Our officers serving as trustees of the trusts do not receive any compensation or other remuneration for their services in such capacity. The full $412 million of outstanding trust preferred stock (calculated as $400 million as discussed above plus our equity share of the two trusts) is shown on our consolidated balance sheet as a liability. Additional information with respect to the trust preferred securities is contained in Note 9 of our Consolidated Financial Statements. Estimated Gross Loss Payments under Insurance and Reinsurance Contracts We are obligated to pay claims under insurance and reinsurance contracts for specified loss events covered under those contracts. As a P&C insurance and reinsurance company, such loss payments represent our most significant future payment obligation. In contrast to other contractual obligations, cash payments are not determinable from the terms specified within the contract. For example, we do not ultimately make a payment to our counterparty for many insurance and reinsurance contracts (i.e., when a loss event has not occurred) and if a payment is to be made, the amount and timing cannot be determined from the contract. In the table above, we estimate payments by period relating to our gross liability for unpaid losses and loss expenses included in the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2004 and do not take reinsurance recoverables into account. These estimated loss payments are inherently uncertain and the amount and timing of actual loss payments are likely to differ from these estimates and the differences could be material. Given the numerous factors and assumptions involved in both estimates of losses and loss expense reserves and related estimates as to the timing of future losses and loss expense payments in the table above, differences between actual and estimated loss payments will not necessarily indicate a commensurate change in ultimate loss estimates. Credit Facilities As our Bermuda subsidiaries are not admitted insurers and reinsurers in the U.S., the terms of certain U.S. insurance and reinsurance contracts require them to provide LOCs to clients. In addition, ACE Global Markets is required to satisfy certain U.S. regulatory trust fund requirements which can be met by the issuance of LOCs. 71 Table of Contents The following table shows our credit facilities by credit line, usage, expiry date and purpose at December 31, 2004. Credit Line1 Usage ExpiryDate Purpose Unsecured Liquidity Facilities ACE Limited2 $ 600 $ 64 April 2007 General Corporate Secured Operational LOC Facilities ACE Limited 500 194 Sept. 2007 General Corporate Unsecured Operational LOC Facilities ACE Limited 850 770 Sept. 2007 General Corporate ACE Limited3 100 97 Cancelled General Corporate ACE International 28 – Various General Corporate Unsecured Capital Facilities ACE Limited4 732 708 Dec. 2009 General Corporate Total $ 2,810 $ 1,833 1 Certain facilities are guaranteed by operating subsidiaries and/or ACE Limited 2 Commercial paper back-up facility, may also be used for LOCs 3 In January 2005, this facility was cancelled and its letter of credit usage was transferred to other operational LOC facilities 4 Supports ACE Global Markets underwriting capacity for Lloyd’s Syndicate 2488-2004 capacity of £550 million (approximately $1 billion) During the fourth quarter of 2004, we renewed a syndicated uncollateralized, five-year LOC facility in the amount of £380 million (approximately $732 million), in order to fulfill the requirements of Lloyd’s for open years of account. This facility was originally arranged in 1998. The unsecured facilities noted above require that we maintain certain covenants, all of which have been met at December 31, 2004. These covenants include: (i) maintenance of a minimum consolidated net worth covenant of not less than $6.0 billion (subject to a reset provision on the last day of each fiscal year) plus 25 percent of cumulative net income since December 31, 2003 (subject to a reset provision on the last day of each fiscal year), plus 50 percent of net proceeds of any issuance of equity interests subsequent to December 31, 2003 (subject to a reset provision on the last day of each fiscal year); and (ii) maintenance of a maximum debt to total capitalization ratio of not greater than 0.35 to 1. Under this covenant, debt does not include trust preferred securities or mezzanine equity, except where the ratio of the sum of trust preferred securities and mezzanine equity to total capitalization is greater than 15 percent. In this circumstance, the amount greater than 15 percent would be included in the debt to total capitalization ratio. At December 31, 2004, (a) the minimum consolidated net worth requirement under the covenant described in (i) above was $6.3 billion and our actual consolidated net worth as calculated under that covenant was $9.2 billion; and (b) our ratio of debt to total capitalization was 0.16 to 1. In addition to these covenants, the ACE Global Markets capital facility requires that collateral be posted if the financial strength rating of ACE Limited falls to S&P BBB+ or lower. Prior to November 2003 (the last renewal date of the ACE Global Markets unsecured LOC), this requirement related to ACE Bermuda. Our failure to comply with the covenants under any credit facility would, subject to grace periods in the case of certain covenants, result in an event of default. This could require us to repay any outstanding borrowings or to cash collateralize letters of credit under such facility. An event of default under one or more credit facilities with outstanding credit extensions of $25 million or more would result in an event of default under all of the facilities described above. American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 On October 22, 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act (the Act) was signed into law by the President of the United States. The Act provides for the election of a special one-time tax deduction of 85 percent of certain foreign earnings that are repatriated (as defined in the Act) under a Domestic Reinvestment Plan to its United States parent corporation in either the parent’s last tax year that began before the enactment date, or the first tax year that begins during the one-year period beginning on the date of enactment. We may apply the provisions of the Act to certain of our applicable subsidiaries. 72 Table of Contents We are in the process of evaluating the effects of the repatriation provisions. The Act includes several provisions for which the United States Treasury has indicated it will issue further guidance, or for which issues have been raised that may require a technical correction to the Act. In January of 2005, the United States Treasury issued its first guidance on selected provisions of the Act, and it expects to issue additional guidance in early 2005. During February of 2005, we repatriated foreign earnings of approximately $42 million subject to a limited Domestic Reinvestment Plan that would qualify under the Act based on guidance issued in January of 2005. The estimated tax benefit associated with this repatriation if the Act provisions are elected is approximately $3 million to $4 million due to the reduction of the net deferred tax liability associated with repatriated earnings. Additional repatriations up to the limitation under the Act of $500 million may be completed through the remainder of 2005. Subject to the completion of our evaluation and expected technical guidance or corrections, we are not in a position to decide whether, and to what extent, we might repatriate foreign earnings that have not yet been remitted to the U.S. as well as determine the associated tax impact as a result of the Act. However, we anticipate that the tax impact would be a reduction of the net deferred tax liability associated with the unremitted earnings. We expect to finalize our assessment of the Act after the expected United States Treasury Guidance has been issued. Recent Accounting Pronouncements See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Market Sensitive Instruments and Risk Management Market risk represents the potential for loss due to adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments. We are exposed to potential loss to various market risks, including changes in interest rates, equity prices and foreign currency exchange rates. Further, through the writings of certain products such as credit derivatives (through our 34.7 percent ownership of Assured Guaranty), GMIBs and GMDBs, we are exposed to deterioration in the credit markets, decreases in interest rates and declines in the equity markets. Our investment portfolio consists of both fixed income and equity securities, denominated in both U.S. and foreign currencies, which are sensitive to changes in interest rates, equity prices and foreign currency exchange rates. As our fixed income and equity securities are classified as available-for-sale, changes in interest rates, equity prices or foreign currency exchange rates will have an immediate affect on comprehensive income and shareholders’ equity but will not ordinarily have an immediate affect on net income. Nevertheless, changes in interest rates and equity prices affect consolidated net income when, and if, a security is sold or impaired. From time to time, we also use investment derivative instruments such as futures, options, interest rate swaps, and foreign currency forward contracts to manage the duration of our investment portfolio and foreign currency exposures and also to obtain exposure to a particular financial market. In addition, as part of our investing activity, we purchase TBAs. These instruments are recognized as assets or liabilities in our Consolidated Financial Statements and are sensitive to changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and equity security prices. Changes in the fair value of these derivative instruments are included in our net realized gains or losses and therefore have an immediate affect on both our net income and shareholders’ equity. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, our notional exposure to investment derivative instruments was $3 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively. The increase in 2004 was primarily due to increased use of swaps, futures and options and the increase in our investment portfolio. We seek to mitigate market risk using a number of techniques, including maintaining and managing the assets and liabilities of our international operations consistent with the foreign currencies of the underlying insurance and reinsurance businesses, thereby limiting exchange rate risk to net assets denominated in foreign currencies. Also, from time to time, we enter into derivative financial instruments for the purpose of managing certain investment portfolio exposures. The following is a discussion of our primary market risk exposures at December 31, 2004. Our policies to address these risks in 2004 were unchanged from 2003. We do not currently anticipate significant changes in our primary market risk exposures or in how those exposures are managed in future reporting periods based upon what is known or expected to be in effect in future reporting periods. Interest rate risk Our exposure to interest rate risk is primarily concentrated in our fixed income portfolio, our debt obligations and to a lesser extent, our GMIB reinsurance business. Changes in investment values attributable to interest rate changes are miti - 73 Table of Contents gated by corresponding and partially offsetting changes in the economic value of our insurance reserves and debt obligations. We monitor this exposure through periodic reviews of our asset and liability positions. The following table shows the impact on the market value of our fixed income portfolio and debt obligations of an increase in interest rates of 100 basis points applied instantly across the yield curve (an immediate time horizon was used as this presents the worst case scenario) at December 31, 2004 and 2003. (in millions of U.S. dollars) 2004 2003 Fair value of fixed income portfolio $ 23,892 $ 20,600 Pre-tax impact of 100 basis point increase in interest rates $ 800 $ 696 Percentage of total fixed income portfolio 3.3% 3.4% Changes in interest rates will have an immediate affect on comprehensive income and shareholders’ equity but will not ordinarily have an immediate affect on net income. Although our debt, preferred stock, and trust preferred securities (collectively, referred to as debt obligations) are reported at amortized value and not adjusted for fair value changes, changes in interest rates could have a material impact on their fair value, albeit there is no immediate impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. At December 31, 2004, the amortized value of our debt obligations was $2.8 billion and the fair value was $3.1 billion. An increase in interest rates of 100 basis points applied instantly across the yield curve would have resulted in a decrease in the fair value of our debt obligations of 6.7 percent at December 31, 2004. This equates to a pre-tax decrease in the fair value of our debt obligations of $209 million at December 31, 2004. Variations in market interest rates could produce significant changes in the timing of prepayments due to prepayment options available. For these reasons, actual results could differ from those reflected in the tables. Our net income is directly impacted by changes in the fair value of GMIBs. For example, net realized gains of $10 million were reported for GMIB reinsurance for the year ended December 31, 2004. The changes in the fair value of GMIBs are determined using internal valuation models. Such valuations require considerable judgment and are subject to significant uncertainty. The valuation of these products is subject to fluctuations arising from, among other factors, changes in interest rates, changes in the equity markets, and changes in the allocation of the investments underlying annuitant’s account value. These models and the related assumptions are continually reviewed by management and enhanced, as appropriate, based upon improvements in modeling techniques and availability of more timely information, such as market conditions and demographics of in-force annuities. Based on in-force annuities covered by GMIB reinsurance treaties at December 31, 2004, we estimate that a downward parallel shift of the yield curve of 100 basis points would result in an unrealized loss of approximately $147 million. This estimated change in fair value would be recorded as net realized losses in our net income. The gain or loss created by the estimated fair value adjustment will rise or fall each period based on estimated market pricing and may not be an indication of ultimate claims. Equity price risk Our portfolio of equity securities, which we carry on our balance sheet at fair value, has exposure to price risk. This risk is defined as the potential loss in fair value resulting from adverse changes in stock prices. In addition, we attain exposure to the equity markets through the use of derivative instruments, which also have exposure to price risk. Our U.S. equity portfolio is correlated with the S&P 500 index and changes in that index would approximate the impact on our portfolio. Our international equity portfolio has exposure to a broad range of non-U.S. equity markets. The following table provides more information on our exposure to equity price risk at December 31, 2004 and 2003. (millions of U.S. dollars) 2004 2003 Fair value of equity securities $ 1,229 $ 544 Fair value of equity derivative instruments 131 118 Total equity exposure $ 1,360 $ 662 Pre-tax impact of 10 percent decline in market prices for equity exposures $ 136 $ 66 Changes in fair value of the derivative equity instruments are recorded as net realized gains (losses) in the consolidated statements of operations. Changes in the fair value of our equity portfolio are recorded as unrealized appreciation 74 Table of Contents (depreciation) and are included as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders’ equity. As discussed above, our net income is directly impacted by changes in the fair value of GMIBs. Based on in-force annuities covered by GMIB reinsurance treaties at December 31, 2004, we estimated that a 10 percent decline in the S&P index would result in an unrealized loss of approximately $55 million. This estimated change in fair value would be recorded as net realized losses in our net income. The gain or loss created by the estimated fair value adjustment will rise or fall each period based on estimated market pricing and may not be an indication of ultimate claims. Foreign currency exchange rate risk Many of our non-U.S. companies maintain both assets and liabilities in local currencies. Therefore, foreign exchange rate risk is generally limited to net assets denominated in those foreign currencies. Foreign exchange rate risk is reviewed as part of our risk management process. Locally required capital levels are invested in home currencies in order to satisfy regulatory requirements, and to support local insurance operations regardless of currency fluctuations. The principal currencies creating foreign exchange risk for us are the British pound sterling, the euro and the Canadian dollar. The following table provides more information on our exposure to foreign exchange rate risk at December 31, 2004 and 2003. (millions of U.S. dollars) 2004 2003 Fair value of net assets denominated in foreign currencies $ 1,555 $ 825 Percentage of fair value of total net assets 15.8 % 9.3 % Pre-tax impact of hypothetical 10% strengthening of U.S. dollar* $ 100 $ 65 * Versus the British pound sterling, the euro and the Canadian dollar",2023-12-30 19:13:24.216675
